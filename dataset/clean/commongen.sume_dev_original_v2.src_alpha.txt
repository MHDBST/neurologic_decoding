Several HMGB1-specific antagonists have provided beneficial results in multiple models of inflammatory disease-preclinical trials including arthritis. Since no HMGB1-specific targeted therapy has yet reached the clinic, we have performed in vitro studies to investigate whether any of a selection of well-established antirheumatic drugs inhibit <re> HMGB1 release <er> as part of its mode of action. Freshly purified peripheral blood monocytes from healthy donors were stimulated in cultures with LPS and IFNγ to cause HMGB1 and TNF release detected in ELISPOT assays. Effects on the secretion were assessed in cultures supplemented with dexamethasone, cortisone, chloroquine, <el> gold sodium thiomalate <le>, methotrexate, colchicine, etanercept or anakinra. Pharmacologically relevant doses of dexamethasone, <el> gold sodium thiomalate <le> and chloroquine inhibited the extracellular release of HMGB1 in a dose-dependent mode. Immunostaining demonstrated that dexamethasone caused intracellular HMGB1 retention. No effects on HMGB1 secretion were observed in cultures with activated monocytes by any of the other studied agents. TNF production in LPS/IFNγ-activated monocytes was readily downregulated by dexamethasone and, to some extent, by chloroquine and etanercept. 
In humans, maximal aerobic power (<re> VO2 <er> max ) is associated with a plateau in cardiac output (Q), but the mechanisms regulating the interplay between maximal heart rate (<el> HRmax <le>) and stroke volume (SV) are unclear. To evaluate the effect of tachycardia and elevations in <el> HRmax <le> on cardiovascular function and capacity during maximal exercise in healthy humans, 12 young male cyclists performed incremental cycling and one-legged knee-extensor exercise (KEE) to exhaustion with and without right atrial pacing to increase HR. During control cycling, Q and leg blood flow increased up to 85% of maximal workload (WLmax) and remained unchanged until exhaustion. SV initially increased, plateaued and then decreased before exhaustion (P < 0.05) despite an increase in right atrial pressure (RAP) and a tendency (P = 0.056) for a reduction in left ventricular transmural filling pressure (LVFP). Atrial pacing increased <el> HRmax <le> from 184 ± 2 to 206 ± 3 beats min(-1) (P < 0.05), but Q remained similar to the control condition at all intensities because of a lower SV and LVFP (P < 0.05). No differences in arterial pressure, peripheral haemodynamics, catecholamines or <re> VO2 <er> were observed, but pacing increased the rate pressure product and RAP (P < 0.05). Atrial pacing had a similar effect on haemodynamics during KEE, except that pacing decreased RAP. 
The antifungal drug <el> ketoconazole <le> is known to inhibit testosterone biosynthesis and decrease serum testosterone concentrations. To assess whether the <el> ketoconazole <le>-induced reduction in serum testosterone might stimulate LH and <re> FSH <er> output in a manner suitable as a test of pituitary gonadotropin reserve, we gave normal men <el> ketoconazole <le> every 8 h for 1 week in dosages of 300-1200 mg/day. Ketoconazole administration caused a dose-dependent reduction in serum testosterone which correlated inversely with serum <el> ketoconazole <le> (r = -0.82; P less than 0.001). This fall in serum testosterone stimulated increases in serum LH and <re> FSH <er> which were maximal at a <el> ketoconazole <le> dose of 900 mg/day [LH increase, 127 +/- 27% (+/- SEM); <re> FSH <er> increase, 63 +/- 15%]. Ketoconazole tended to blunt the LH and <re> FSH <er> responses to LHRH. Ketoconazole increased serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone, reflecting blockade of 17,20-desmolase by the drug, while having inconsistent effects on serum estradiol. 
The developmental pluripotency‑associated 4 (Dppa4) gene serves critical roles in cell self‑renewal, as well as in cancer development and progression. However, the regulatory role of Dppa4 in non‑small‑cell lung cancer (<re> NSCLC <er>) and its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. The aim of the present study was to investigate the biological function of Dppa4 in <re> NSCLC <er> and its underlying mechanism of action. Dppa4 expression was measured in <re> NSCLC <er> tissue samples and cell lines, and its effect on cell proliferation and the expression of glycolytic enzymes was determined. In addition, the underlying mechanisms of Dppa4‑induced alterations in glycolysis were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were also performed to analyze the prognostic significance of clinicopathological characteristics. Dppa4 was found to be highly expressed in <re> NSCLC <er> tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, it was observed that Dppa4 was correlated with the degree of tumor differentiation and TNM stage. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified Dppa4 expression and clinical stage as prognostic factors for <re> NSCLC <er> patients. Kaplan‑Meier analysis further revealed that patients with lower Dppa4 expression exhibited a better prognosis. In <re> NSCLC <er> cells, Dppa4 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, while Dppa4 overexpression enhanced cell proliferation, which was likely mediated by glycolysis promotion. Dppa4 knockdown had no evident effect on the majority of enzymes examined; however, glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT‑4) and pyruvate kinase isozyme M2 were significantly upregulated, and hexokinase II (HK‑II) and lactate dehydrogenase B (<el> LDHB <le>) were downregulated following Dppa4 knockdown. By contrast, Dppa4 overexpression resulted in downregulation of GLUT‑4, and upregulation of HK‑II, enolase and <el> LDHB <le>, whereas it had no effect on other enzymes. Since the most evident effect was observed on <el> LDHB <le>, further functional experiments demonstrated that this enzyme reversed the promoting effects of Dppa4 in <re> NSCLC <er>. 
Liver alcohol dehydrogenase (<re> ADH <er>) activity is decreased towards exogenous substrates after partial hepatectomy (PH), probably due to putative endogenous substrates acting as <re> ADH <er> inhibitors. Hence, retinoids could be suitable candidates as such endogenous substrates. Therefore, cytosolic <re> ADH <er> kinetic analysis using several substrates, liver cytosolic and mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activities, retinal and retinol content, as well as expression of proteins for <re> ADH <er> and CRBPI (a retinol carrier protein) were determined in liver samples, at two stages of liver regeneration (one- or two-thirds PH). The effect of inhibiting in vivo liver <re> ADH <er> by 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP) was also evaluated after 70%-PH. With 70%-PH, in vitro <re> ADH <er> activity towards exogenous alcohols and aldehydes was diminished, but retinol oxidation was increased and retinal reduction was decreased. These activities that be due to the participation of an <re> ADH <er> <el> type <le> which did not correlate with the amount of immunoreactive <re> ADH <er> protein. Cytosolic and mitochondrial ALDH activities oxidized actively retinal, whereas retinol and CBRP-I expression were reduced in these animals. With 30%-PH, these changes were less evident and sometimes opposite to those found with 70%-PH. In addition, retinol readily inhibited <re> ADH <er>-mediated ethanol oxidation. Interestingly, in vivo 4-MP administration inhibited <re> ADH <er> activity in a dose-dependent manner correlating with a progressive inhibition of liver regeneration. 
Insulin rapidly upregulates protein levels of <re> PKC <er>δ in classical <el> insulin <le> target tissues skeletal muscle and liver. Insulin induces both a rapid increase in de novo synthesis of <re> PKC <er>δ protein. In this study we examined the possibility that <el> insulin <le> may also inhibit degradation of <re> PKC <er>δ. Experiments were performed on L6 skeletal muscle myoblasts or myotubes in culture. Phorbol ester (PMA)- and <el> insulin <le>-induced degradation of <re> PKC <er>δ were abrogated by proteasome inhibition. Both PMA and <el> insulin <le> induced ubiquitination of <re> PKC <er>δ, but not of that <re> PKC <er>α or <re> PKC <er>ε and increased proteasome activity within 5 min. We examined the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of <re> PKC <er>δ in targeting <re> PKC <er>δ for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Transfection of cells with <re> PKC <er>δY(311)F, which is not phosphorylated, resulted in abolition of <el> insulin <le>-induced ubiquitination of <re> PKC <er>δ and increase in proteasome activity. 
Mono-<el> ADP <le> <re> ribosylation of actin <er> by bacterial toxins, such as Clostridium perfringens iota or Clostridium botulinum C2 toxins, results in rapid depolymerization of actin filaments and cell rounding. Here we report that treatment of African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells with iota toxin resulted in delayed caspase-dependent death. Unmodified actin did not reappear in toxin-treated cells, and enzyme-active toxin was detectable in the cytosol for at least 24 h. C2 toxin showed comparable, long-lived effects in cells, while a C2 toxin control lacking <el> ADP <le>-ribosyltransferase activity did not induce cell death. To address whether the remarkable stability of the iota and C2 toxins in cytosol was crucial for inducing cell death, we treated cells with C/SpvB, the catalytic domain of Salmonella enterica SpvB. Although C/SpvB also mono-<el> ADP <le> ribosylates actin as do the iota and C2 toxins, cells treated with a cell-permeating C/SpvB fusion toxin became rounded but recovered and remained viable. Moreover, unmodified actin reappeared in these cells, and <el> ADP <le>-ribosyltransferase activity due to C/SpvB was not detectable in the cytosol after 24 h, a result most likely due to degradation of C/SpvB. Repeated application of C/SpvB prevented recovery of cells and reappearance of unmodified actin. 
Peritoneal fibrosis (PF) caused by long-term peritoneal dialysis is closely associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (<re> EMT <er>) of human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs). Moreover, the anti-fibrotic role of <el> Arc <le>tigenin (<el> Arc <le>) has been reported in several fibrosis disorders. Therefore, the preventive effect of <el> Arc <le> on transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-induced <re> EMT <er> and the underlying mechanisms in HPMCs was investigated in this study. Firstly, the PD model was established by TGF-β1 stimulation in cultured HPMCs in vitro, we found that TGF-β1 significantly increased the <re> EMT <er> markers (α-SMA, vimentin, and fibronectin) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) expressions, but decreased epithelial marker (E-cadherin). Co-treatment with <el> Arc <le> (10, 20, 40 μM) ameliorated TGF-β1-induced <re> EMT <er> in a dose-dependent manner, and the expression of PAI-1 was also inhibited by <el> Arc <le>, which was abrogated by restoration of PAI-1. Moreover, <el> Arc <le> enhanced the phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), but inhibited the phosphorylated IκBα level and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) p65 in TGF-β1-induced HPMCs. ChIP and Luciferase reporter assays verified that the increased binding capacity of NF-κB to the promoter of PAI-1 induced by TGF-β1 was reversely attenuated by <el> Arc <le> in HPMCs. 
Dronedarone is an antiarrhythmic agent approved in 2009 for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. An in-house preliminary study demonstrated that <el> dronedarone <le> inhibits cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and 3A5 in a time-dependent manner. This study aimed to investigate the inactivation of CYP450 by <el> dronedarone <le>. We demonstrated for the first time that both <el> dronedarone <le> and its main metabolite N-desbutyl <el> dronedarone <le> (NDBD) inactivate CYP3A4 and <re> CYP3A5 <er> in a time-, concentration-, and NADPH-dependent manner. For the inactivation of CYP3A4, the inactivator concentration at the half-maximum rate of inactivation and inactivation rate constant at an infinite inactivator concentration are 0.87 µM and 0.039 minute(-1), respectively, for <el> dronedarone <le>, and 6.24 µM and 0.099 minute(-1), respectively, for NDBD. For <re> CYP3A5 <er> inactivation, the inactivator concentration at the half-maximum rate of inactivation and inactivation rate constant at an infinite inactivator concentration are 2.19 µM and 0.0056 minute(-1) for <el> dronedarone <le> and 5.45 µM and 0.056 minute(-1) for NDBD. The partition ratios for the inactivation of CYP3A4 and <re> CYP3A5 <er> by <el> dronedarone <le> are 51.1 and 32.2, and the partition ratios for the inactivation of CYP3A4 and <re> CYP3A5 <er> by NDBD are 35.3 and 36.6. Testosterone protected both CYP3A4 and <re> CYP3A5 <er> from inactivation by <el> dronedarone <le> and NDBD. Although the presence of Soret peak confirmed the formation of a quasi-irreversible metabolite-intermediate complex between <el> dronedarone <le>/NDBD and CYP3A4/<re> CYP3A5 <er>, partial recovery of enzyme activity by potassium ferricyanide illuminated an alternative irreversible mechanism-based inactivation (MBI). MBI of CYP3A4 and <re> CYP3A5 <er> was further supported by the discovery of glutathione adducts derived from the quinone oxime intermediates of <el> dronedarone <le> and NDBD. 
Occasional case reports have shown that acute myopathy may occur in patients treated with massive doses of corticosteroids. The mechanism of this myopathy is poorly understood. Therefore, 60 male rats were randomly assigned to receive daily injection of saline (C), methylprednisolone (M), or triamcinolone (T) 80 mg/kg/d for 5 d. Nutritional intake, measured daily in 15 animals, showed a significant reduction of food intake in the <el> steroid <le>-treated groups (-50 and -79% in M and T, respectively). This was associated with a similar loss in body weight. In the 45 remaining animals, diaphragm contractility and histopathologic features of several muscles were studied. Weights of respiratory and peripheral muscles were similarly decreased after <el> steroid <le> treatment. Maximal twitches of the diaphragm were lower in the C group (653 +/- 174 g/cm(2)) than in the M group (837 +/- 171 g/cm(2); p < 0.05) and the T group (765 +/- 145 g/cm(2), NS). Half-relaxation time was prolonged in both <el> steroid <le> groups, and time to peak tension was longer with M, whereas tetanic tensions were similar. Steroid treatment also induced a leftward shift of the force-frequency curve at 25 and 50 Hz when compared with saline treatment (p < 0.05). ATPase staining of the diaphragm, scalenus medius, and gastrocnemius showed type IIb fiber atrophy in the <el> steroid <le> groups and also diaphragmatic type IIa atrophy with T, whereas histologic examinations revealed a normal muscular pattern with absence of <re> necrosis <er>. Finally, a pair-fed (PF) study, performed in 18 rats (C, T, and PF), showed that muscle atrophy was considerably less pronounced in PF animals than in T-treated animals. 
Endochondral ossification is initiated by the differentiation of mesenchymal precursor cells to chondrocytes (<re> chondrogenesis <er>). This process is characterized by a strong interdependence of cell shape, cytoskeletal organization, and the onset of chondrogenic gene expression, but the molecular mechanisms mediating these interactions are not known. Here we investigated the role of the RhoA/<el> ROCK <le> pathway, a well characterized regulator of cytoskeletal organization, in <re> chondrogenesis <er>. We show that pharmacological inhibition of <el> ROCK <le> signaling by Y27632 resulted in increased glycosaminoglycan synthesis and elevated expression of the chondrogenic transcription factor Sox9, whereas overexpression of RhoA in the chondrogenic cell line ATDC5 had the opposite effects. Suppression of Sox9 expression by <el> ROCK <le> signaling was achieved through repression of Sox9 promoter activity. These molecular changes were accompanied by reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, where RhoA/<el> ROCK <le> signaling suppressed cortical actin organization, a hallmark of differentiated chondrocytes. This led us to analyze the regulation of Sox9 expression by drugs affecting cytoskeletal dynamics. Both inhibition of actin polymerization by cytochalasin D and stabilization of existing actin filaments by jasplakinolide resulted in increased Sox9 mRNA levels, whereas inhibition of microtubule polymerization by colchicine completely blocked Sox9 expression. 
TNFR-1 (p55) and <el> Fas <le> share a death domain which is critical for <re> apoptosis <er> signaling whereas TNFR-p55 and TNFR-2 (p75) can activate NF-kappaB leading to anti-apoptotic proteins expression such as A1. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the role(s) of TNFR-p55 and TNFR-p75 in <el> Fas <le>-mediated neutrophil <re> apoptosis <er> and A1 expression in a mouse model of endotoxemia. Gene knockout (KO) (p55-/-, p75-/-, p55(-/-)/p75(-/-)) or wild type (WT) mice were injected i.p. with saline or LPS (4 microg/g) followed by collecting peripheral blood after 24 h. Neutrophil <re> apoptosis <er> was assessed by propidium iodide staining using two-color flow cytometry with granulocyte-specific Gr1-FITC after 6-h whole blood culture with or without <el> Fas <le> agonist Jo2 (300 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (CHX, 30 microg/ml). Membrane-associated receptors (<el> Fas <le>, TNFR-p55 and TNFR-p75) and cytoplasmic A1 expression of freshly isolated neutrophils were assessed by one-color flow cytometry and western blotting respectively. Compared with the group-WT/Sal, Jo2 induced <re> apoptosis <er> only in the presence of CHX (J+C). J+C-induced <re> apoptosis <er> was significantly lower in the group-p55(-/-)/Sal and p55(-/-)/p75(-/-)/Sal but not in the group-p75(-/-)/Sal. J+C-induced <re> apoptosis <er> was inhibited similarly in all the LPS-injected WT and KO mice. Strong A1 expression was also induced similarly in all the LPS-injected WT and KO mice. <el> Fas <le> and TNFR-p55 expression was normal and TNFR-p75 was significantly increased in all the LPS-injected WT and KO mice although absence of the appropriate surface receptors was confirmed in the KO mice. 
Androgen receptor signaling fuels prostate cancer and is a major therapeutic target. However, mechanisms of resistance to therapeutic <re> androgen <er> ablation are not well understood. Here, using a prostate cancer mouse model, Pten(pc-/-), carrying a prostate epithelial-specific Pten deletion, we show that the αvβ6 <el> integrin <le> is required for tumor growth in vivo of castrated as well as of noncastrated mice. We describe a novel signaling pathway that couples the αvβ6 <el> integrin <le> cell surface receptor to <re> androgen <er> receptor via activation of JNK1 and causes increased nuclear localization and activity of <re> androgen <er> receptor. This downstream kinase activation by αvβ6 is specific for JNK1, with no involvement of p38 or ERK kinase. In addition, differential phosphorylation of Akt is not observed under these conditions, nor is cell morphology affected by αvβ6 expression. This pathway, which is specific for αvβ6, because it is not regulated by a different αv-containing <el> integrin <le>, αvβ3, promotes upregulation of survivin, which in turn supports anchorage-independent growth of αvβ6-expressing cells. Consistently, both αvβ6 and survivin are significantly increased in prostatic adenocarcinoma, but are not detected in normal prostatic epithelium. Neither XIAP nor Bcl-2 is affected by αvβ6 expression. 
Cisplatin (CDDP)-induced nephrotoxicity (<re> CIN <er>) is one of the most serious toxicities caused by this potent antitumor agent. It has been reported that Mg premedication attenuates <re> CIN <er> in clinical trials; however, the mechanism underlying its nephroprotection is not fully understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether Mg administration affects CDDP accumulation by regulating the expression level of <el> renal transporters <le>. Rats were divided into control, Mg (40mg/kg) alone, 2.5mg/kg CDDP with (20 and 40mg/kg) and without Mg, 5mg/kg CDDP groups. These substances were administered on the same day and 7 days later their kidneys were removed. The expression levels of <el> renal transporters <le> and platinum (Pt) accumulation were analyzed. The serum creatinine level was significantly increased by CDDP administration and treatment with Mg significantly ameliorated such elevation. The expressions of the renal organic cation transporter 2 (rOct2) and renal multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (rMate1) were downregulated and upregulated, respectively following co-administration with Mg, which significantly reduced the renal Pt accumulation in the 2.5mg/kg CDDP-treated group. Moreover, Mg dose-dependently downregulated rOct2, not affecting rMate expression, resulting in the attenuation of <re> CIN <er>. Mg co-administration protected the downregulation of the transient receptor potential subfamily Melastatin 6 (rTrpm6), but not the epidermal growth factor (rEgf), as a result, Mg co-injection attenuated CDDP-induced hypomagnesemia. 
The clinical diagnosis of cardiac <el> sarcoidosis <le> can be difficult and is largely dependent on newer imaging modalities. A retrospective search of sudden cardiac deaths was performed from a reference laboratory and statewide medical examiner system for a 12-year period. Planimetry was performed on gross photographs of transverse short-axis sections, and the phase of the lesion and the portion of myocardium extent was estimated histologically. Lesions were classified histologically as early (primarily lymphocytic), intermediate (primarily granulomatous), and late (primarily scar). A total of 41 cases were found, including 25 in which the death was ascribed to <el> sarcoidosis <le> of the heart (group 1) and 16 in which <re> sudden death <er> was due to other findings (group 2). No significant differences were found in age or activity at death, although gross scars and epicardial nodules were more frequent in group 1 (p <0.0001). In the hearts with gross scars, the ventricular septum had the largest percentage of involvement (32%) followed by the posterior wall (25%). Histologically, the intermediate phase predominated in group 1, and the late phase predominated in group 2. Approximately 50% of the cases in group 1 had involvement in the right ventricular apex and septum, suggesting a positive yield by biopsy. 
The influence of beta-adrenergic blockade by oral <el> propranolol <le> on the variability of <re> GH <er> responses to <re> GH <er>RH and on <re> GH <er> responsiveness to repeated <re> GH <er>RH administrations was investigated. Eight normal volunteers underwent three tests on three separate occasions. Each test consisted of two administrations of 80 micrograms <re> GH <er>RH at 2-h intervals without other medication (test 1) or combined with oral administration of 80 mg <el> propranolol <le> 90 min before the first (test 2) or the second <re> GH <er>RH injection (test 3). In test 1 <re> GH <er> levels increased significantly after the first, but not the second <re> GH <er>RH bolus (net incremental area under the curve [nAUC], mean +/- SD: 1453 +/- 974 and 178 +/- 309 micrograms.l-1.(120 min)-1, respectively). In test 2 basal <re> GH <er> secretion was not influenced by <el> propranolol <le> administration, whereas the <re> GH <er> response to the first <re> GH <er>RH injection was significantly greater than in test 1 (2327 +/- 1814 micrograms.l-1.(120 min)-1; p less than 0.05). However, individual subjects showed the same variability of <re> GH <er> response as in test 1. The <re> GH <er> response to the second <re> GH <er>RH bolus remained negligible. In test 3 administration of <el> propranolol <le> 90 min before the second <re> GH <er>RH bolus led to a clear <re> GH <er> increase (690 +/- 1002 micrograms.l-1.(120 min)-1), not significantly different from the <re> GH <er> response to the first bolus (1796 +/- 1375 micrograms.l-1.(120 min)-1). However, only 4 subjects showed a marked restoration of the <re> GH <er> responsiveness to the second <re> GH <er>RH administration. 
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are implicated in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), but remain largely unclear. Using publicly available transcriptome sequencing data from renal cancer (n = 703) and integrating bioinformatics analyses, we screened and identified a valuable lncRNA, <re> EGFR <er>-AS1. In our validation cohort (n = 204), <re> EGFR <er>-AS1 was significantly upregulated in RCC tissues (P < 0.001). Gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies showed that <re> EGFR <er>-AS1 promoted cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Based on previous studies and sequence complementarity of <re> EGFR <er> with <re> EGFR <er>-AS1, we demonstrated that <re> EGFR <er>-AS1 directly bound to <re> EGFR <er> mRNA and inhibited its degradation. Furthermore, RNA pull-down and mass spectrometry analyses showed that <re> EGFR <er>-AS1 interacted with <el> HuR <le>, which was responsible for the mRNA stability of <re> EGFR <er>. Multivariate analysis suggested that higher <re> EGFR <er>-AS1 expression predicted a poor prognosis in RCC patients (high vs low: P = 0.018, HR = 2.204, 95% CI: 1.145-4.241). 
Cardiohemodynamic effects of <el> perhexiline <le> were investigated in anesthetized open-chest dogs, measuring blood flow rates of the pulmonary artery (PAF), superior and inferior venae cavae (SVCF and IVCF), right atrial pressure (RAP), systemic blood pressure (SBP), and heart rate (HR). Sum of SVCF and IVCF was interpreted as venous return (<re> VR <er>). Perhexiline, 0.3-3 mg/Kg, injected intravenously over 2 min caused dose-dependent increases in PAF, <re> VR <er>, and RAP, followed by decreases in PAF and <re> VR <er> at higher doses. SBP and HR were depressed with <el> perhexiline <le> dose-dependently. Verapamil, 0.03-0.3 mg/Kg, also increased PAF, <re> VR <er>, and RAP to the lesser extent than <el> perhexiline <le>. Verapamil decreased these variables except RAP more markedly than <el> perhexiline <le>. Treatment with propranolol (1 mg/Kg) and phentolamine (1 mg/Kg) which completely blocked cardiohemodynamic effect of 1 microgram/Kg of norepinephrine, markedly attenuated the effects of <el> perhexiline <le> on <re> VR <er> and PAF but not completely. 
Insulin plays a major role in the control of pancreatic amylase biosynthesis. In this study we determined glucose metabolism by pancreatic acini as well as the pancreatic content of both amylase protein and amylase mRNA during development of <re> insulin resistance <er> in the obese Zucker rat. At age 4 weeks there were no abnormalities detected in the above parameters, although the obese animals were already hyperinsulinaemic. At 6 weeks glucose metabolism was decreased by 50% in acini from obese rats, whereas pancreatic amylase-gene expression was only slightly impaired. At 22 weeks glucose metabolism was decreased by 50%, amylase content by 55% and amylase mRNA by 60% in acinar tissue of obese rats. As expected, hyperinsulinaemia increased markedly with age. Thus development of severe <re> insulin resistance <er> was associated with impairment of amylase-gene expression. To decrease <re> insulin resistance <er>, one group of adult obese rats was treated with <el> Ciglitazone <le> for 4 weeks. A lowered plasma insulin concentration without alteration of food intake was taken as evidence of decreased <re> insulin resistance <er>. This was associated with normalization of glucose metabolism and a marked increase of both amylase content of pancreatic tissue and amylase mRNA. 
Here we have characterized perthamide C, a cyclopeptide from a Solomon Lithistid sponge Theonella swinhoei, which displays an anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory activity. The study has been performed using the carragenan-induced mouse paw edema that displays an early (0-6 h) and a late phase (24-96 h). Perthamide C significantly inhibits neutrophils infiltration in tissue both in the early and late phases. This effect was coupled to a reduced expression of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (<el> eNOS <le>) in the early phase while cyclooxygenase-1 and 2 (COX-1, COX-2), and inducible <re> NO <er>S (iNOS) expression were unaffected. In the late phase perthamide C reduced expression of both <re> NO <er>S isoforms without affecting COXs expression. This peculiar selectivity toward the two enzymes deputed to produce <re> NO <er> lead us to investigate on a possible action of perthamide C on lymphocytes infiltration and activation. We found that perthamide C inhibited the proliferation of peripheral lymphocytes, and that this effect was secondary to its metabolic activation in vivo. 
Resumption of meiosis, induced by <el> LH <le>, is preceded by the breakdown of gap junctional communication, which terminates the supply of cAMP from the somatic cells of the ovarian follicle to the oocyte. It has recently been shown that <el> LH <le>-induced reinitiation of meiosis is mediated by MAPK; however, the underlying molecular mechanism involved in the action of this enzyme remains unknown. We hypothesized that activation of MAPK interrupts junctional communication within the ovarian follicle, leading, in turn, to <re> oocyte maturation <er>. To test this hypothesis, we blocked the activation of MAPK by UO126, which specifically inhibits the MAPK signaling pathway. We analyzed junctional communication using three complementary methods: 1) patch-clamp analysis, which determined changes in the electrical coupling between two adjacent granulosa cells; 2) the scrape-loading technique, which monitored the spread of dyes through a granulosa cell layer; and 3) a metabolic coupling assay, which evaluated the transfer of radiolabeled uridine from the cumulus cells to the oocyte. We show, herein, that the somatic follicle cells, rather than the oocyte, activate MAPK immediately after their exposure to <el> LH <le>. Moreover, inhibition of <el> LH <le>-induced MAPK activation not only prevents <re> oocyte maturation <er> but also blocks the reduction in junctional communication. In addition, the appearance of the two phosphorylated forms of the gap junction protein, connexin 43, in response to <el> LH <le>, was avoided by UO126. 
Theophylline, in addition to its bronchodilator effect, may attenuate inflammation in asthma. We did a double-blind placebo-controlled study of the effect of oral <el> theophylline <le> on the <re> inflammatory response <er> of the bronchial mucosa to inhalation of allergen in 19 atopic asthmatic subjects. Bronchoscopy and bronchial biopsy were done 24 hours after allergen inhalation before and after six weeks of treatment with oral slow-release <el> theophylline <le>, 200 mg 12 hourly. The mean serum concentration was 36.6 mumol/L, which is below the currently-accepted therapeutic range. After treatment with <el> theophylline <le> there was a significant reduction in the number of EG2-positive activated eosinophils (5.9 before and 2.1 after treatment, Wilcoxon signed rank p < 0.05) and total eosinophils (16.7 before and 7.6 after treatment, p < 0.05) beneath the epithelial basement membrane. 
In pancreatic acinar cells, the epidermal growth factor (<el> EGF <le>) receptor interacts with both cholera toxin- and pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G proteins. In the present study, isolated rat pancreatic acini were used to investigate the effect of <el> EGF <le> on basal and secretagogue-induced adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (<re> cAMP <er>) production and amylase release. <el> EGF <le> increased <re> cAMP <er> production and amylase release in pancreatic acini. However, <re> cAMP <er> accumulation and amylase release elicited by either vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) or forskolin were inhibited by <el> EGF <le> (17 nM). <el> EGF <le> inhibited the VIP-induced <re> cAMP <er> production and amylase release with a half-maximal effective concentration of 3 and 2 nM, respectively. <el> EGF <le> had no effect on the N6,2'-O-dibutyryladenosine-3',5'-monophosphate-stimulated amylase release, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of <el> EGF <le> on the VIP- and forskolin-induced <re> cAMP <er> production is due to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. PTX pretreatment of the acini led to an increase of the basal, <el> EGF <le>-, and VIP-stimulated <re> cAMP <er> accumulation and amylase release, indicating that PTX-sensitive G proteins exert tonic inhibition of adenylyl cyclase even in the absence of agonist. In PTX-pretreated acini, the inhibitory effect of <el> EGF <le> on the VIP-induced <re> cAMP <er> production and amylase release was abolished. 
In functionally skinned muscle fibers from the rabbit, we studied the effect of <el> propranolol <le> on <re> calcium <er> activation of the contractile proteins and, in separate experiments, on <re> calcium <er> uptake and release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) while measuring physiological tension. Pieces from isolated papillary muscle (PM), soleus (SL) (slow-twitch skeletal muscle), and adductor magnus (AM) (fast-twitch skeletal muscle) were homogenized (sarcolemma disrupted). A fiber bundle from PM and single fibers from SL and AM were dissected from the homogenate and mounted on a photodiode tension transducer. To study Ca2+-activated tension development of the contractile proteins, we used high EGTA (7 mmol/l) to control the free <re> calcium <er> concentration. To study SR function, we used five different solutions to load the <re> calcium <er> into the SR and to release it from the SR with 25 mmol/l caffeine, thus producing a tension transient. In general, <el> propranolol <le> has similar mechanisms of action in the three muscle types. Propranolol (0.1-1.0 mmol/l) increased the submaximal <re> calcium <er>-activated tension development in all muscles but with PM = SL greater than AM, and this increase was correlated with increases in <re> calcium <er> binding to isolated troponin C. Propranolol increased the maximal <re> calcium <er>-activated tension development in PM and SL, but decreased that in AM. Propranolol at concentrations of 0.3-1.0 mmol/l decreased <re> calcium <er> uptake by the SR but did not change <re> calcium <er> release in any of the three muscles. 
Alterations in <el> phosphate <le> homeostasis play an important role in the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism in renal failure. Until recently, it was accepted that <el> phosphate <le> retention only increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion through indirect mechanisms affecting calcium regulation and calcitriol synthesis. However, recent in vitro studies have suggested that <el> phosphate <le> may directly affect <re> PTH secretion <er>. Our goal was to determine whether in vivo an intravenous <el> phosphate <le> infusion stimulated <re> PTH secretion <er> in the absence of changes in serum calcium. Three different doses of <el> phosphate <le> were infused intravenously during 120 minutes to increase the serum <el> phosphate <le> concentration in dogs. Sulfate was also infused intravenously as a separate experimental control. A simultaneous calcium clamp was performed to maintain a normal ionized calcium concentration throughout all studies. At the lowest dose of infused <el> phosphate <le> (1.2 mmol/kg), serum <el> phosphate <le> values increased to approximately 3 mM, but PTH values did not increase. At higher doses of infused <el> phosphate <le> (1.6 mmol/kg and 2.4 mmol/kg), the increase in serum <el> phosphate <le> to values of approximately 4 mM and 5 mM, respectively, was associated with increases in PTH, even though the ionized calcium concentration did not change. Increases in PTH were not observed until 30-60 minutes into the study. These increases were not sustained, since by 120 minutes PTH values were not different from baseline or controls despite the maintenance of marked hyperphosphatemia. During the sulfate infusion, serum sulfate values increased by approximately 3-fold, but no change in PTH values were observed. 
Only one of several available ophthalmic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is currently FDA approved for use in acute seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC). Sixty patients with SAC and moderate itching and bulbar conjunctival injection were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, parallel-group trial comparing diclofenac sodium (DS) with <el> ketorolac tromethamine <le> (KT). Patients instilled 1 drop four times daily while awake for 14 days. Ocular <re> signs and symptoms <er> were evaluated at one and two weeks. The primary efficacy variables were itching and bulbar conjunctival injection. For both treatments, the ocular allergy sign and symptom scores were comparable at baseline. Both treatments evaluated in this study were well tolerated. Significant clinical and statistical reductions from baseline were observed in the primary efficacy variables. Treatment group differences were observed for the pain/soreness score with an advantage observed for the DS group at 30 minutes and at day 7. 
Phyllodia of the Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plant Kalanchoë tubiflora were allowed to fix (13)CO2 in light and darkness during phase IV of the diurnal CAM cycle, and during prolongation of the regular light period. After (13)CO2 fixation in darkness, only singly labelled [(13)C]<re> malate <er> molecules were found. Fixation of (13)CO2 under illumination, however, produced singly labelled <re> malate <er> as well as <re> malate <er> molecules which carried label in two, three or four carbon atoms. When the irradiance during (13)CO2 fixation was increased, the proportion of singly labelled <re> malate <er> decreased in favour of plurally labelled <re> malate <er>. The irradiance, however, did not change either the ratio of labelled to unlabelled <re> malate <er> molecules found in the tissue after the (13)CO2 application, or the magnitude of <re> malate <er> accumulation during the treatment with label. The ability of the tissue to store <re> malate <er> and the labelling pattern changed throughout the duration of the prolonged light period. The results indicate that <re> malate <er> synthesis by CAM plants in light can proceed via a pathway containing two carboxylation steps, namely ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate-carboxylase/oxygenase (EC 4.1.1.39) and <el> phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase <le> (EC 4.1.1.31) which operate in series and share common intermediates. 
1. The GABA-B receptor agonists baclofen and 3-aminopropylphosphinic acid (3-APPi) have antitussive activity in the <el> cat <le> and guinea pig. The purpose of this study was to investigate the sites of action of these GABA-B receptor agonists to inhibit the <re> cough <er> reflex. 2. Single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) cannulas were placed in the lateral ventricles of anaesthetized guinea pigs. Approximately 1 week later, the animals were exposed to aerosols of capsaicin (0.3 mM) to elicit <re> cough <er>ing. Coughs were detected with a microphone and counted. 3. Cough was produced in anaesthetized <el> cat <le>s by mechanical stimulation of the intrathoracic trachea and was recorded from electromyograms of respiratory muscle activity. Cannulas were placed for intravenous (i.v.) or, in separate groups of animals, intravertebral arterial (i.a.) administration of baclofen, 3-APPi, the centrally active antitussive drug codeine or the peripherally active antitussive drug BW443c. Dose-response relationships for i.v. and i.a. administration of each drug were generated to determine a ratio of i.v. ED50 to i.a. ED50, known as the effective dose ratio (EDR). The EDR will be 20 or greater for a centrally acting drug. 4. In the guinea pig, baclofen (3 mg kg-1, s.c.) and 3-APPi (10 mg kg-1, s.c.) inhibited capsaicin-induced <re> cough <er> by 50% and 35% respectively. The antitussive activity of baclofen was completely blocked by i.c.v. administration of the GABA-B receptor antagonist CGP 35348 (10 micrograms). Conversely, the antitussive effect of 3-APPi was unaffected by i.c.v. CGP 35348. However, systemic administration of CGP 35348 (30 mg kg-1, s.c.) completely blocked the antitussive activity of 3-APPi (10 mg kg-1, s.c.). In separate experiments baclofen alone (1 microg, i.c.v.) inhibited capsaicin-induced <re> cough <er> by 78%. 3-APPi (10 and 100 microg, i.c.v.) had no effect on capsaicin-induced <re> cough <er> in the guinea pig.5. In the <el> cat <le>, potencies (ED50) of the standards and GABA-B agonists by the i.v. route were: codeine(0.34 mg kg-1), BW443C (0.17 mg kg-1), baclofen (0.63 mg kg-1) and 3-APPi (2.3 mg kg-1). Potencies of these drugs by the i.a. route were: codeine, 0.013 mg kg-1; BW443C, 0.06mg kg-1; baclofen,0.016mg kg-1; and 3-APPi, 0.87 mg kg-1. 
Increased free radical production and <el> hyperinsulinemia <le> are thought to play a role in experimental and human atherosclerosis, but the relation between the 2 abnormalities has not been studied. In 23 healthy volunteers, we measured the susceptibility of circulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) <re> cholesterol <er> particles to in vitro copper sulfate oxidation (measured as the lag phase) and cell-mediated oxidative modification (measured as malondialdehyde generation in LDL during incubation with human umbilical vein endothelial cells), as well as the vitamin E content of LDL <re> cholesterol <er> at baseline and after 2 hours of physiological <el> hyperinsulinemia <le> (euglycemic insulin clamp). The lag time of LDL oxidation decreased from control values of 108+/-3 and 107+/-3 minutes (at baseline and after 2 hours of saline infusion) to 101+/-3 minutes after 2 hours of clamping (P<0.0001). At corresponding times, cell-mediated malondialdehyde generation in LDL rose from 4.96+/-0.11 and 4.98+/-0.10 to 5.28+/-0.10 nmol/L (P=0. 0006), whereas the LDL vitamin E content decreased from 6.78+/-0.06 and 6.77+/-0.06 to 6.64+/-0.06 microg/mg (P<0.04). The insulin-induced shortening of the lag phase was directly related to the decrement of vitamin E in LDL; furthermore, in subjects with higher baseline serum triglyceride levels, insulin induced a greater shortening of the lag phase than in subjects with low baseline triglycerides. 
As a means of assessing the effects of natural inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes on arachidonic acid metabolism in vivo, the authors supplemented the diet of 38 New Zealand white rabbits with <el> fish <le> oil containing eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (EPA/DHA) or olive oil (control). Endometriosis was surgically induced 10 days later using a previously described experimental technique. Peritoneal fluid <re> PGE2 <er> and PGF2-alpha concentrations were significantly lower in the EPA/DHA group versus controls (P less than 0.05, P = 0.05, respectively). Total endometrial implant diameter 8 weeks after induction of endometriosis was significantly smaller in the experimental group (3.1 +/- 0.2 cm) compared with the controls (4.0 +/- 0.3 cm) (P less than 0.03). 
Recombinant forms of human antithrombin (<el> AT <le>) were expressed in COS-1 cells, and their interaction with human <re> thrombin <er> characterized by comparing the reactivity of two engineered mutant forms of <el> AT <le> with the wild-type recombinant. Both mutant forms contained single amino acid substitutions of Asp (G392D) or Pro (G392P) for the wild-type Gly, at residue 392, termed the P2 position with reference to the adjacent reactive centre bond. All three forms of <el> AT <le> co-migrated on Western blots, with an apparent molecular weight of 58 kD, with endoglycosidase F treatment reducing their mobility to 47 kD. The two mutant forms of <el> AT <le> reacted with <re> thrombin <er> differently from the wild-type molecule, in that the G392D substitution abrogated the <re> thrombin <er> inhibitory capacity of the protein, while the G392P substitution enhanced the reactivity of the recombinant mutant <el> AT <le> with <re> thrombin <er>. Under pseudo-first order conditions, the second order rate constants for the reaction of the recombinant wild-type and G392P mutant <el> AT <le> were determined to be 1.4 x 10(4) L-mol-1 sec-1 and 3.0 x 10(4) L-mol-1 sec-1, respectively, a difference of 210%. In contrast, in the presence of heparin, the reaction rates of the G392P and wild-type <el> AT <le> forms with <re> thrombin <er>, differed by less than 25%. 
Prostaglandin E2 (<re> PGE2 <er>) can cause softening of the bovine cervix at oestrus when receptors for oxytocin (<el> OT <le>) are maximally present, indicating a relationship between <el> OT <le> and <re> PGE2 <er> production. It was therefore determined whether <el> OT <le> can stimulate prostaglandin synthesis or induce cyclooxygenase expression in cervical external os segments obtained from pre-oestrous-oestrous cows. Tissues were minced and incubated (50-100 mg mL[-1] 6 h[-1]) in the presence of <el> OT <le> (10 ng mL[-1]), progesterone (P4) (5 ng mL[-1]) and/or indomethacin (5 microg mL[-1]). It was found that <el> OT <le> stimulated basal <re> PGE2 <er> (7.79+/-1.22 ng 100 mg[-1], mean+/-s.e.m.; n = 6) in external os segments from pre-oestrous-oestrous cows (P < 0.03), whereas P4 and indomethacin inhibited basal and <el> OT <le>-stimulated <re> PGE2 <er> production (P < 0.05). Basal prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2alpha) production was minimal (<1 ng 100 mg[-1]) and <el> OT <le> had no effect on its production. Expression of cyclooxygenase was measured by Western blot analysis following incubation of the tissue (100 mg 1.5 mL[-1] 3 h[-1]) in the presence of <el> OT <le> (10 ng mL[-1]) and in the presence of P4 (5 ng mL[-1]). It was found that <el> OT <le> stimulated the induction of cyclooxygenase II (79+/-10%; n = 7, P < 0.05). In contrast, P4 inhibited the basal expression of this enzyme (-40+/-5%, n = 7, P < 0.05) in the presence or absence of <el> OT <le>. 
Prenatal dexamethasone exposure (PDE) induces developmental toxicities of multiple organs in offspring. Here, we verified the intergenerational effect of low peak bone <re> mass <er> induced by PDE and investigated its intrauterine programming mechanism. Pregnant rats were injected subcutaneously with 0.2 mg/kg/d dexamethasone from gestation day (GD) 9 to 20. Some pregnant rats were killed for the fetuses on GD20, and the rest went on to spontaneous labor to produce the first-generation (F1) offspring. The adult F1 male offspring were mated with normal females to produce the F2 offspring. In vivo, PDE leads to low peak bone <re> mass <er> in F1 male offspring rats at postnatal week (PW) 28. Furthermore, PDE reduced the bone <re> mass <er> in F1 male offspring from GD20 to PW12. Meanwhile, the osteogenic differentiation was suppressed and the local renin-angiotensin system (<el> RAS <le>) was activated continuously by PDE. Moreover, the histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) level in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) promoter region was increased by PDE from GD20 to PW12. Likewise, PDE induced the low peak bone <re> mass <er> and the activated local <el> RAS <le> in F2 male offspring. Meaningfully, the H3K27ac level of ACE was increased by PDE in the F2 offspring. In vitro, dexamethasone inhibited bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) osteogenic differentiation and promoted <el> RAS <le> activation. Furthermore, dexamethasone recruited CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α and p300 into the BMSCs nucleus by activating glucocorticoid receptor, which cooperatively increased the H3K27ac level in the ACE promoter region. 
Angiotensin II (<el> Ang II <le>) is a neuroendocrine factor that promotes hypertension and has been implicated in vascular inflammation through the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proinflammatory genes in endothelial cells. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the effect of <el> Ang II <le> on fractalkine (<re> FKN <er>), an important chemokine involved in endothelial dysfunction. In the study, we aimed to investigate the protective role of total flavonoids from Plumula Nelumbinis (TFPN), the main component extracted from Semen Nelumbinis, in <el> Ang II <le>-induced oxidative stress injury in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, we studied whether TFPN could attenuate the <el> Ang II <le>-induced generation of ROS and the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB); whether these <el> Ang II <le>-induced effects were inhibited by apocynin (a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase inhibitor) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (an NF-κB inhibitor). In the present study, it was observed that total flavonoids from Plumula Nelumbinis (TFPN), the main component extracted from Semen Nelumbinis, concentration-dependently inhibited the <re> FKN <er> production induced by <el> Ang II <le> in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, TFPN attenuated the <el> Ang II <le>-induced generation of ROS and the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB); these <el> Ang II <le>-induced effects were also inhibited by apocynin (a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase inhibitor) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (an NF-κB inhibitor). 
In Arabidopsis thaliana root meristems the <el> GATA <le>2 transcription factor is a marker for the root transition domain, is auxin regulated, and functions to restrict <re> cell division <er> activity. The growing part of roots is comprised of three discrete regions; the proliferative domain (PD), an elongation zone, and interposed between these two, the transition domain (TD), which is the focus of this investigation. Within the TD, it is hypothesized that cells are reprogrammed, losing the capacity to divide and begin to differentiate. In recently germinated Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings, a TD is not anatomically evident, but subsequently forms in a region of the root in which there has occurred prior expression of both AUX1/PIN2 proteins and of transcripts of the <el> GATA <le> transcription factor family (pGATA2:H2B-YFP or pGATA2:GUS). pGATA2:GUS expression is regulated by auxin and is reduced in seedlings in which either auxin transport or auxin sensitivity is perturbed. Application of cytokinin results in a reduction in both pGATA2:GUS expression and in TD cell number, via a pathway involving ARR1 and ARR12. Overexpression of <el> GATA <le>2 is accompanied by a reduction in cell number in the PD, but has no effect on cell number in the TD, whereas in knockdowns of <el> GATA <le> transcription factors, cell number is reduced in both the PD and TD. 
Delta-sleep-inducing peptide (DSIP, 10(-9) - 10(-7) M) significantly inhibited the <el> CRF <le>-induced <re> ACTH release <er> from rat anterior pituitary quarters in vitro. 10(-8) M DSIP showed the most prominent inhibition. DSIP (10(-8) M) also inhibited the <el> CRF <le>-activated cAMP levels in anterior pituitary tissue. DSIP did not influence basal ACTH or cAMP levels. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-release from anterior pituitary quarters was not changed by DSIP. 
Withaferin A (<el> WA <le>), a promising anticancer constituent of Ayurvedic medicinal plant Withania somnifera, inhibits growth of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells in culture and MDA-MB-231 xenografts in vivo in association with <re> apoptosis <er> induction, but the mechanism of cell death is not fully understood. We now demonstrate, for the first time, that <el> WA <le>-induced <re> apoptosis <er> is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) production due to inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. <el> WA <le> treatment caused ROS production in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, but not in a normal human mammary epithelial cell line (HMEC). The HMEC was also resistant to <el> WA <le>-induced <re> apoptosis <er>. <el> WA <le>-mediated ROS production as well as apoptotic histone-associated DNA fragment release into the cytosol was significantly attenuated by ectopic expression of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. ROS production resulting from <el> WA <le> exposure was accompanied by inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation and inhibition of complex III activity. Mitochondrial DNA-deficient Rho-0 variants of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were resistant to <el> WA <le>-induced ROS production, collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, and <re> apoptosis <er> compared with respective wild-type cells. <el> WA <le> treatment resulted in activation of Bax and Bak in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, and SV40 immortalized embryonic fibroblasts derived from Bax and Bak double knockout mouse were significantly more resistant to <el> WA <le>-induced <re> apoptosis <er> compared with fibroblasts derived from wild-type mouse. 
Premature aging (<re> senescence <er>) of endothelial cells might play an important role in the development and progression of hypertension and atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that bradykinin, a hormone that mediates vasoprotective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, protects endothelial cells from oxidative stress-induced <re> senescence <er>. Bradykinin treatment (0.001 to 1 nmol/L) dose-dependently decreased <re> senescence <er> induced by 25 micromol/L of H(2)O(2) in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells, as witnessed by a complete inhibition of increased senescent cell numbers and a 34% reduction of the levels of the <re> senescence <er>-associated cell cycle protein p21. Because H(2)O(2) induces <re> senescence <er> through <el> superoxide <le>-induced DNA damage, single-cell DNA damage was measured by comet assay. Bradykinin reduced DNA damage to control levels. The protective effect of bradykinin also resulted in a significant increase in the migration of H(2)O(2)-treated bovine aorta endothelial cells in an in vitro endothelial injury model, or "scratch" assay. The protective effect of bradykinin was abolished by the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist HOE-140 and the NO production inhibitor N(omega)-methyl-L-arginine acetate salt. 
We sought to determine whether systemic administration of <el> protease <le>s ameliorates membranous nephritis induced in rats by immunization and challenge with cationic bovine gamma globulin, and whether targeting of <el> protease <le> to glomerular capillaries increases efficacy. Proteases substituted with biotin were targeted via the cationic protein avidin A, which by virtue of its charge has affinity for the glomerular basement membrane. Despite identical pretreatment <re> proteinuria <er>, rats given untargeted <el> protease <le> (biotin-conjugated without avidin, or unconjugated plus avidin) had significantly less <re> proteinuria <er> than saline-treated controls and nephrotic rats given avidin plus biotin-conjugated (targeted) <el> protease <le> had even less <re> proteinuria <er> and reduced glomerular rat IgG and C3. Among more severely nephrotic rats, targeted <el> protease <le> was again more effective than untargeted <el> protease <le> at reducing <re> proteinuria <er>, and also decreased the size of electron-dense glomerular deposits, hypercholesterolemia, and creatininemia. Inactivated targeted <el> protease <le>s had no effect on <re> proteinuria <er>, hypercholesterolemia, or azotemia. Finally, active targeted <el> protease <le> did not affect <re> proteinuria <er> in the nonimmune mediated nephrosis induced by puromycin aminonucleoside. 
Cigarette smoking has been epidemiologically correlated with lower <re> BP <er> in humans, despite the acute <re> BP <er> effects of nicotine. Cotinine, a primary metabolite of nicotine, has been suggested as a mediator of the <re> BP <er>-lowering effect of smoking. To determine the cardiovascular effects of <el> cotinine <le> itself, arterial <re> BP <er> was monitored continuously in chronically instrumented Sprague-Dawley rats before, during, and after 14 days of intraarterial (i.a.) infusion of <el> cotinine <le> or placebo. Cardiovascular data were collected and analyzed by microcomputer for diurnal changes and for light- and dark-cycle averages. Heart rate (HR) was higher in both precotinine and placebo groups during the dark cycle than during the light cycle. HR was significantly lower (p < 0.025) during <el> cotinine <le> infusion in the <el> cotinine <le> group as compared with placebo. Five days after <el> cotinine <le> infusion, however, HR was not different from that of placebo controls. Arterial <re> BP <er> was not different between <el> cotinine <le>- and placebo-treated rats at any time period. The difference between HR but not arterial <re> BP <er> suggested that baroreceptor activity might differ after <el> cotinine <le> administration. Baroreceptor activity, assessed by analysis of HR changes evoked by phenylephrine, did not differ before and during <el> cotinine <le> administration, however. 
<el> Gpn3 <le> is required for RNA polymerase II (<re> RNAPII <er>) nuclear targeting. Here, we investigated the effect of a cancer-associated Q279* nonsense mutation in <el> Gpn3 <le> cellular function. Employing RNAi, we replaced endogenous <el> Gpn3 <le> by wt or Q279* RNAi-resistant <el> Gpn3 <le>R in epithelial model cells. <re> RNAPII <er> nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity were markedly decreased in cells expressing only <el> Gpn3 <le>R Q279*. Wild-type <el> Gpn3 <le>R localized to the cytoplasm but a fraction of <el> Gpn3 <le>R Q279* entered the cell nucleus and inhibited Gpn1-EYFP nuclear export. This property and the transcriptional deficit in <el> Gpn3 <le>R Q279*-expressing cells required a PDZ-binding motif generated by the Q279* mutation. 
Four different isoforms of phospholipase C-beta (<re> PLC-beta 1 <er>-4) have been discovered, raising the important question of whether a distinct receptor activates a single PLC-beta isoenzyme or a subset of PLC-beta isoenzymes. The present study was designed to investigate activation of PLC-beta isoenzymes by three different PLC-activating agonists that bind to different receptor entities, i.e., cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8), <el> bombesin <le>, and carbachol in rat pancreatic acinar membranes. PLC activity was measured using exogenous [3H]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate as substrate. Western blot analysis of pancreatic acinar membranes revealed the presence of <re> PLC-beta 1 <er>, -beta 3, -gamma 1, and -delta 1, but not of PLC-beta 2, -beta 4, -gamma 2, and -delta 2. Preincubation of the membranes with anti-<re> PLC-beta 1 <er> or -beta 3 antibody reduced agonist-induced activation of PLC. The order of sensitivity toward inhibition by anti-<re> PLC-beta 1 <er> antibody was CCK-8 > <el> bombesin <le> > carbachol. An opposite order of sensitivity was found for inhibition of PLC activity by anti-PLC-beta 3 antibody (carbachol > <el> bombesin <le> > CCK-8). Anti-PLC-beta 2, -beta 4, -gamma 1, -gamma 2, -delta 1, and -delta 2 antibodies had no effect. Preincubation of the membranes with an antibody raised against the COOH terminus of the alpha-subunit of Gq/11 proteins inhibited PLC activity in response to all three different receptor agonists to a similar extent, whereas anti-Gi alpha 1-2 and anti-Gi alpha 3 antibodies had no effect. 
Increased <re> platelet aggregation <er> contributes to vascular risk. D-003, a mixture of high molecular weight sugarcane wax acids, has shown antiplatelet effects in experimental models and healthy volunteers. This randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study investigated the effects of titrated doses of D-003 (5-20 mg/d) on <re> platelet aggregation <er> in hypercholesterolemic patients. After a 4-week baseline phase, 56 patients were randomised to D-003 5 mg/d or placebo. The doses were doubled every 15 days if arachidonic acid (AA)-induced <re> platelet aggregation <er> was not inhibited at least by 15%. AA (0.75 and 1.5 mmol/L) and <el> collagen <le> (1 microg/mL)-induced <re> platelet aggregation <er>, laboratory and physical safety indicators were assessed at baseline and every 15 days thereafter, when adverse events (AE) were also reported. No significant change of <re> platelet aggregation <er> was found in the placebo group. After 15, 30 and 45 on therapy, D-003 reduced <re> platelet aggregation <er> induced with both AA 0.75 mmol/L (18.1%, 19.0% and 30.3%, respectively) and AA 1.5 mmol/L (17.0%, 16.3% and 22.5%, respectively), and also <el> collagen <le>-induced <re> platelet aggregation <er> (26.6%, 20.8% and 29.4%) (p < 0.01 at days 15 and 30 versus placebo, p < 0.0001 at study completion). The mean inhibition of <re> platelet aggregation <er> with D-003 at day 15, at which all patients had received the lowest dose, was over 15%. Nineteen out of 28 D-003 randomised patients (67.9%) required dose titration to achieve such goal. At trial completion, the mean estimated dose was 11.6 mg/d. D-003 lowered low-density lipoprotein (22.0 %), total cholesterol (14.7%) and raised high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (10.9%) (p < 0.0001 versus placebo). Six patients (2 placebo, 4 D-003) withdrew from the trial, none due to AE. D-003 did not modify the safety indicators with respect to placebo. Four patients (2 placebo, 2 D-003-treated) reported AE: pruritus and increased blood pressure (2 placebo) and rash and polyphagla (2 D-003). 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (<re> HCC <er>) is a primary cancer of the liver. Target therapy may improve prognosis of <re> HCC <er>. In the present study, we evaluated the inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway as a potential therapeutic approach. HepG2 cells were treated with the β-catenin inhibitor <el> FH535 <le>. β-catenin protein expression was semi-quantitatively assessed using western blot analysis. Cell proliferation was examined with a 3‑(4,5-dimethyl-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium salt (MTS) assay. The mRNA expression of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The Griess assay was used to determine nitric oxide (NO) concentration. <el> FH535 <le> inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells and decreased β-catenin protein expression. mRNA expression of iNOS, a target gene of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, was decreased in <el> FH535 <le>‑treated HepG2 cells compared to the control group. NO production was also reduced by <el> FH535 <le>. 
Lung cancer has high morbidity and mortality rates. Smoking is involved in the pathogenesis of lung cancer, and tobacco smoke may increase tumor cell invasion and metastasis. The effects of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) on the carcinoma human alveolar basal epithelial A549 cell line were investigated. A549 cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of CSE for 12, 24 and 48 h, and the transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) signal pathway was inhibited by addition of <el> SB431542 <le>, a TGF-β1 receptor antagonist. The proliferation of A549 cells was assayed by a Cell Counting kit-8, <re> invasiveness <er> was assayed using Transwell chambers, and TGF-β1, phosphorylated mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2 (p-Smad2), and matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3) levels was assessed by western blot analysis. The <re> invasiveness <er> of A549 cells and the expression of TGF-β1, pSmad2, and MMP-3 were significantly increased by CSE (P<0.05). The effects of CSE were abrogated by <el> SB431542 <le> (P<0.05). 
Peripherally administered corticotropin-releasing factor (<el> CRF <le>) inhibits gastric acid secretion in the rat via unknown mechanisms. Because intravenous <el> CRF <le> can produce marked systemic <re> hypotension <er>, the hypothesis that its antisecretory effect is due to a reduction in gastric mucosal blood flow (MBF) was tested. Corpus MBF was measured by hydrogen gas clearance in fasted, urethan-anesthetized rats. <el> CRF <le> (15 nmol.kg-1.h-1 iv) had no significant effect on MBF but significantly decreased systemic blood pressure (BP) by 21.8 +/- 3.4%. This dose of <el> CRF <le> significantly decreased acid secretion stimulated by 40 micrograms.kg-1.h-1 pentagastrin iv but did not decrease MBF despite a 30.3 +/- 2.3% decrease in BP. To avoid the confounding effect of systemic <re> hypotension <er> on MBF, close gastric intra-arterial infusions were performed. <el> CRF <le> (1.7 nmol/h ia) had no effect on BP and did not increase MBF. <el> CRF <le> (3.4 nmol/h ia) slightly decreased BP without modifying MBF. In contrast, histamine (200 micrograms/h ia) significantly increased MBF by 58 +/- 11%. 
Muscle contracts due to ATP-dependent interactions of <el> myosin <le> motors with thin <re> filament <er>s composed of the proteins actin, troponin, and tropomyosin. Contraction is initiated when calcium binds to troponin, which changes conformation and displaces tropomyosin, a <re> filament <er>ous protein that wraps around the actin <re> filament <er>, thereby exposing <el> myosin <le> binding sites on actin. Myosin motors interact with each other indirectly via tropomyosin, since <el> myosin <le> binding to actin locally displaces tropomyosin and thereby facilitates binding of nearby <el> myosin <le>. Defining and modeling this local coupling between <el> myosin <le> motors is an open problem in muscle modeling and, more broadly, a requirement to understanding the connection between muscle contraction at the molecular and macro scale. It is challenging to directly observe this coupling, and such measurements have only recently been made. Analysis of these data suggests that two <el> myosin <le> heads are required to activate the thin <re> filament <er>. This result contrasts with a theoretical model, which reproduces several indirect measurements of coupling between <el> myosin <le>, that assumes a single <el> myosin <le> head can activate the thin <re> filament <er>. To understand this apparent discrepancy, we incorporated the model into stochastic simulations of the experiments, which generated simulated data that were then analyzed identically to the experimental measurements. By varying a single parameter, good agreement between simulation and experiment was established. 
Oxytocin antagonist (OTA), <re> TT-235 <er>, was developed by our group and shown to inhibit either spontaneous or <el> oxytocin <le>-induced uterine contractions in primates. The purpose of the present study was to confirm the duration of <re> TT-235 <er> to block <el> oxytocin <le>-induced uterine contractions in estrous rats. In Experiment 1, the time-response of the three OTAs on uterine contractility was examined. The rats were anesthetized and cannulas were placed in the jugular vein for infusing vehicle (sterile saline), Antag I, Antag II and <re> TT-235 <er>. The uterine activity was monitored through a water-filled balloon-tipped cannula placed in the uterine horn. The uterine contractile activity was determined as the integrated area for 10 minutes. Each OTA was administered as a single bolus injection of 5 microg, followed by 100 mU of <el> oxytocin <le> 5 minutes later, also done as a single bolus. Oxytocin injection of the same dosage was repeated every hour for 5 hours. Experiment 2 determined the effect of the three OTAs on uterine <el> oxytocin <le> receptor number (Rn) and binding affinity (Kd). Rats treated with either OTA or vehicle were sacrificed at 0.5 and 4 hours for receptor assay. In Experiment 1, Antag I, Antag II and <re> TT-235 <er> inhibited the integrated uterine response to <el> oxytocin <le> at 5 minutes by 76%, 77% and 80%, respectively, compared to controls (p<0.05). Two hours after injecting Antag I, inhibition of uterine contractility was 55% lower than controls (p<0.05). At 3 hours, uterine contractility was no longer affected in rats treated with Antag I compared with controls. The suppressive uterine activity with Antag II continued up to 3 hours. However, uterine contractility remained lower (53%) in rats treated with <re> TT-235 <er> 5 hours later. In Experiment 2, <re> TT-235 <er> induced a significant decrease (p<0.05) in <el> oxytocin <le> receptor number and binding affinity at both 0.5 and 4 hours compared with controls. Antag I and Antag II did not alter <el> oxytocin <le> receptor number or binding affinity significantly at each time point studied compared with controls. 
Cycloheximide (20-200 mg/l) did not affect basal D-[U-14C]xylose uptake by rat soleus muscle (2.4 +/- 0.2 mumol . g-1 . h-1). However, the stimulatory effect of <el> insulin <le> on <re> sugar <er> transport was progressively reduced from 375% above basal in control muscles to 170% in muscles exposed to 200 mg cycloheximide/l but above this concentration cycloheximide inhibited basal xylose uptake without further effect on the incremental effect of <el> insulin <le>. Cycloheximide affected the <el> insulin <le> dose-response curve both by depressing <el> insulin <le> sensitivity and by reducing the maximum stimulatory effect of the hormone. In contrast to the inhibition of <el> insulin <le> action, which increased progressively over the range 20-200 mg cycloheximide/l, muscle protein synthesis was inhibited maximally at a concentration of 10 mg/l. Cycloheximide also inhibited the <el> insulin <le>omimetic effects of anoxia, 2:4-dinitrophenol, salicylate, cooling, hydrogen peroxide, diamide, vitamin K5, hyperosmolarity and EDTA, but did not affect concanavalin A-stimulated xylose uptake. 
Intracellular pH (<el> pHi <le>), membrane potential (Vm) and membrane conductance (<re> Gm <er>) in fused proximal tubular cells of the frog kidney, were determined at three extracellular pH (pHo) values, 7.5, 8.5 and 6.5. Imposed changes of pHo by +/- 1 pH unit induced parallel but smaller shifts of <el> pHi <le>. The alkaline milieu hyperpolarized the cells and increased <re> Gm <er>, whereas the acid milieu depolarized and lowered <re> Gm <er>. We subsequently introduced a weak acid and its conjugate base (acetic acid/acetate), or a weak base and its conjugate acid (NH3/NH4+), at pHo 7.5, 8.5 and 6.5 to shift <el> pHi <le> without altering pHo, or to shift <el> pHi <le> against imposed changes of pHo. From these experiments, we observed that under some circumstances Vm varied with pHo but without <re> Gm <er> or <el> pHi <le> changes, whereas under other circumstances changes of <re> Gm <er> occurred during alterations of <el> pHi <le> while pHo and Vm remained unaltered. At <el> pHi <le> approximately 6.5 associated with Vm approximately -10 mV, <re> Gm <er> dramatically increased to quasi-infinite values. This increase was not an artifact since <re> Gm <er> returned to its control value following recovery to the control solution or in the presence of hyperosmotic solution. 
GnRH antagonists, such as <el> Antide <le>, are being evaluated for potential contraceptive applications. Although their contraceptive efficacy clearly results from their rapid inhibitory effects on gonadotropin release, there remains the possibility of other incidental effects. Under certain physiological conditions, the release of prolactin (Prl) appears to be temporally related to the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and hence by inference to the secretion of GnRH. Here, we examined the effects of the GnRH antagonist <el> Antide <le> on the <re> release of LH <er> and Prl. Under agonadal conditions, a remarkable concordance was seen between LH and Prl pulses with up to 100% of pulses being coincident. Administration of <el> Antide <le> resulted in a rapid parallel decline in both LH and Prl with LH levels falling by 50% within 2 h and Prl levels falling by 30-40%. At this dose of <el> Antide <le> (1.0 mg/kg, sc), pulsatile <re> release of LH <er> and Prl continued albeit at a much reduced amplitude. The administration of a bolus of exogenous GnRH in the face of GnRHant-induced suppression resulted in prompt <re> release of LH <er> and Prl in all 3 monkeys. 
Recent evidences suggest that NAD(+) depletion leads to abnormal hepatic lipid metabolism in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (<re> NAFLD <er>); however, the contributing mechanism is not well understood. Our previous study showed that <el> troxerutin <le>, a trihydroxyethylated derivative of natural bioflavonoid rutin, effectively inhibited obesity, and normalized hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in high-cholesterol diet-induced diabetic mice. Here we investigated whether <el> troxerutin <le> improved hepatic lipid metabolism via preventing NAD(+) depletion in HFD-induced <re> NAFLD <er> mouse model and the mechanisms underlying these effects. Our results showed that <el> troxerutin <le> markedly prevented obesity, liver steatosis and injury in HFD-fed mice. Troxerutin largely suppressed oxidative stress-mediated NAD(+)-depletion by increasing nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) protein expression and decreasing poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) protein expression and activity in HFD-treated mouse livers. Consequently, <el> troxerutin <le> remarkably restored Silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog1 (SirT1) protein expression and activity in HFD-treated mouse livers. Therefore, <el> troxerutin <le> promoted SirT1-mediated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation to inhibit mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, which enhanced nuclear lipin 1 localization, lowered cytoplasmic lipin 1 localization and the ratio of hepatic Lpin 1β/α. Ultimately, <el> troxerutin <le> improved lipid homeostasis by enhancing fatty acid oxidation and triglyceride secretion, and suppressing lipogenesis in HFD-fed mouse livers. 
Wernicke's encephalopathy and Korsakoff's psychosis in <el> alcohol <le>ics are thought to be due to thiamine deficiency. When the process goes untreated, patients may develop <el> alcohol <le>-induced persisting <re> dementia <er>. We review the literature on thermal dysregulation and the place of thiamine treatment in Wernicke's encephalopathy, Korsakoff's psychosis, and <el> alcohol <le>-induced persisting <re> dementia <er>. We describe a patient with <el> alcohol <le>-induced persisting <re> dementia <er> who showed thermal dysregulation which responded to parenteral but not oral thiamine. Subsequently, he developed aspiration pneumonia with associated fever reaction and expired. We describe the neuroimaging findings--diffuse cortical atrophy, ventricular dilatation, atrophy of the corpus callosum, hypothalamus, and medulla, and a probable arachnoid cyst in the left temporal tip. 
Ethanol is a common cause of both acute and chronic pancreatitis. Studies in other organs suggest that polymorphonuclear neutrophils activated by <el> ethanol <le> may cause tissue injury in a variety of conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of <el> ethanol <le> on <re> neutrophil extravasation <er> in the feline pancreas. Pancreata were isolated and perfused at different flow rates with varying concentrations of <el> ethanol <le> in either a physiological or neutrophil depleted perfusate. Neutrophil extravasation was assessed by measuring pancreatic tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Ethanol at 2.5% (54.25 mmol/liter) was the lowest concentration that still caused significant <re> neutrophil extravasation <er> (3.1+/-0.8 vs 1.9+/-0.2 units, P<0.05) and was accompanied by an increase in vascular resistance of 15%. Reduction of pancreatic perfusion by 15% did not significantly increase <re> neutrophil extravasation <er>. (1.1+/-0.3 vs 1.6+/-0.2 units, NS) Perfusion of the pancreas with neutrophil-depleted blood containing either <el> ethanol <le> or saline, followed by perfusion with an <el> ethanol <le>-free perfusate, showed an increase in <re> neutrophil extravasation <er> in the <el> ethanol <le> group compared to the control group (3.2+/-0.9 vs 1.9+/-0.2 units, P<0.05). 
Two merino ewes were fed 800 and then 1000 g of lucerne chaff per day and renal responses and extracellular fluid volume (E.C.F.) were determined. Urine <re> urea <er> nitrogen, glomerular filtration rate (G.F.R.), urine volume, effective renal plasma flow (E.R.P.F.) and E.C.F. increased in both animals with the greater nitrogen intake. In a second experiment, five merino wethers and four merino ewes were infused intraruminally with increasing quantities of <re> urea <er>, whilst being fed a mainly roughage ration, and the above parameters were determined. No significant changes in <el> G.F.R., <le> E.R.P.F. or E.C.F. were noted. Urinary excretion maintained a linear response to nitrogen input until 20.6 g of <re> urea <er> nitrogen per day were infused. At this level of infusion, an increased fractional reabsorption of <re> urea <er> resulted in a large increase in plasma <re> urea <er> concentration, but when 500 mmol of NaCl or KCl were added to the infusate, urine <re> urea <er> nitrogen excretion increased from 10.4 to 11.4 and 11.9 g/d respectively and plasma <re> urea <er> concentration decreased from 68.0 to 35.2 and 37.3 mg nitrogen/100 ml. Urea clearance virtually trebled with both electrolyte infusions and E.C.F. and G.F.R. increased by approximately 10 and 25% respectively. 
Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (<el> mTORC1 <le>) is an emerging regulator of blood-tissue barriers that utilizes ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) as the downstream signaling molecule. To explore the role of rpS6 in blood-testis barrier (<re> BTB <er>) function, a constitutively active quadruple rpS6 phosphomimetic mutant was constructed in mammalian expression vector and overexpressed in Sertoli cells cultured in vitro that mimicked the <re> BTB <er> in vivo. Using this quadruple phosphomimetic mutant, phosphorylated (p)-rpS6 was shown to disrupt IGF-1/insulin signaling, thereby abolishing Akt phosphorylation, which led to an induction of MMP-9. This increase in MMP-9 secretion perturbed the Sertoli cell tight junction permeability barrier by proteolysis-mediated downregulation of tight junction proteins at the <re> BTB <er>. These findings were confirmed by the use of a specific MMP-9 inhibitor that blocked the disruption of the tight junction permeability barrier by the rpS6 mutant. Additionally, RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated Akt silencing was able to mimic the results of rpS6 mutant overexpression in Sertoli cells, further confirming this p-rpS6-Akt-MMP-9 signaling pathway. 
The current dogma is that <el> obesity <le>-associated hepatic <re> inflammation <er> is due to increased Kupffer cell (KC) activation. However, recruited hepatic macrophages (RHMs) were recently shown to represent a sizable liver macrophage population in the context of <el> obesity <le>. Therefore, we assessed whether KCs and RHMs, or both, represent the major liver inflammatory cell type in <el> obesity <le>. We used a combination of in vivo macrophage tracking methodologies and adoptive transfer techniques in which KCs and RHMs are differentially labeled with fluorescent markers. With these approaches, the inflammatory phenotype of these distinct macrophage populations was determined under lean and obese conditions. In vivo macrophage tracking revealed an approximately sixfold higher number of RHMs in obese mice than in lean mice, whereas the number of KCs was comparable. In addition, RHMs comprised smaller size and immature, monocyte-derived cells compared with KCs. Furthermore, RHMs from obese mice were more inflamed and expressed higher levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 than RHMs from lean mice. A comparison of the MCP-1/C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) chemokine system between the two cell types showed that the ligand (MCP-1) is more highly expressed in KCs than in RHMs, whereas CCR2 expression is approximately fivefold greater in RHMs. 
To determine the mechanism(s) involved in vasorelaxation of small arteries from hypertensive rats, normotensive (NORM), angiotensin II-infused (ANG), high-salt (HS), ANG high-salt (ANG/HS), placebo, and deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt rats were studied. Third-order mesenteric arteries from ANG or ANG/HS displayed decreased sensitivity to acetylcholine (ACh)-induced vasorelaxation compared with NORM or HS, respectively. Maximal relaxations were comparable between groups. Blockade of Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels had no effect on ANG versus blunting relaxation in NORM (log EC(50): -6.8+/-0.1 versus -7.2+/-0.1 mol/L). NO synthase (<el> NOS <le>) inhibition abolished ACh-mediated relaxation in small arteries from ANG, ANG/HS, and deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt versus blunting relaxation in NORM, HS, and placebo (% maximal relaxation: ANG: 2.7+/-1.8; ANG/HS: 7.2+/-3.2; NORM: 91+/-3.1; HS: 82.1+/-13.3; deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt: 35.2+/-17.7; placebo: 79.3+/-10.3), indicating that <el> NOS <le> is the primary vasorelaxation pathway in these arteries from hypertensive rats. We hypothesized that NO/<re> cGMP <er> signaling and <el> NOS <le>-dependent H(2)O(2) maintains vasorelaxation in small arteries from ANG. ACh increased <el> NOS <le>-dependent <re> cGMP <er> production, indicating that NO/<re> cGMP <er> signaling is present in small arteries from ANG (55.7+/-6.9 versus 30.5+/-5.1 pmol/mg), and ACh stimulated <el> NOS <le>-dependent H(2)O(2) production (ACh: 2.8+/-0.2 micromol/mg; N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride+ACh: 1.8+/-0.1 micromol/mg) in small arteries from ANG. H(2)O(2) induced vasorelaxation and catalase blunted ACh-mediated vasorelaxation. 
The abnormal proliferation of mesangial cells with IgA deposition in the glomeruli characterizes primitive mesangial glomerulonephritis (IgA nephropathy, IgAN); this disease reduces the normal renal parenchyma while renal function becomes progressively impaired. The possible role of selenium has never been considered in evaluating factors involved in the pathogenesis of IgAN. In this work we compared the <re> Se <er> status of 14 IgAN patients (8 with normal renal function, IgAN NRF; 6 with impaired renal function, IgAN IRF) to that of 14 normal individuals (CG NRF) before and after an oral supplementation with <el> selenite <le> (0.13 mol <re> Se <er>/kg b.w./day for 60 days). The following indices of <re> Se <er> status were measured: <re> Se <er> in plasma and urine samples by PIXE; glutathione peroxidase activity in the cytosol of platelets (PLTs-GSH-Px) and of erythrocytes (RBCs-GSH-Px). Both concentrations and activities of plasma glutathione peroxidase (pl-GPx), a selenoenzyme mainly synthesized in and secreted by the kidney, were measured in plasma samples and results compared among groups. IgAN patients showed lower pl-<re> Se <er> and lower activities of selenoenzymes than normal controls before <re> Se <er> supplementation (p < 0.001). These findings suggest that an impaired <re> Se <er> status coexisted with the proliferation of mesangial cells in patients. <re> Se <er>lenite induced PLTs-GSH-Px activity in all individuals (p < 0.001), but no variation was observed in RBCs-GSH-Px activity or in the concentration of pl-GPx in the plasma. On the other hand, selenium induced pl-GPx activity in CG NRF (p < 0.001) and in IgAN NRF (p < 0.01), but poorly stimulated pl-GPx activity in IgAN IRF (p = n.s.). However, only 17% and 25% of the pl-GPx activity of normal controls was measured in the plasma of IgAN IRF and IgAN NRF patients, respectively (p < 0.001). 
We infused hyperoncotic <el> albumin <le> (25 or 50 gm of a 50% solution) into patients with noncardiac pulmonary edema (adult respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]) to evaluate its effect on the transmicrovascular flux from blood to pulmonary edema fluid of two radiotracers--111In-DTPA (mol wt 504) and 125I-human serum <el> albumin <le> (HSA) (mol wt 69,000). Two groups of patients were studied--one with a modest increase in permeability of the pulmonary alveolocapillary membrane to 125I-HSA (group 1) and another with a large increase in permeability to 125I-HSA (group 2). We used furosemide, when necessary, to minimize the effect of <el> albumin <le> infusion to increase the pulmonary microvascular hydrostatic pressure (<re> Pmv <er>), measured clinically as the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). Therapy significantly increased the mean colloid osmotic pressure (COP) in both groups, but not the mean PCWP or calculated <re> Pmv <er>. Albumin had no significant effect on the mean pulmonary transmicrovascular flux of the radiotracers in either group, despite the increase in COP. In individual patients, a change in the <re> Pmv <er> in response to <el> albumin <le> infusion was directly correlated with the change in flux of 111In-DTPA [group 1: delta In-DTPA (%) = 8.66 + 1.4 delta <re> Pmv <er> (%) r = 0.51, P less than 0.02; group 2: delta In-DTPA (%) = -3.43 + 1.6 delta <re> Pmv <er> (%) r = 0.67, P less than 0.01]. A change in the transmicrovascular flux of I-HSA also correlated with a change in the intravascular Starling forces in both groups. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of diabetes mellituson tissue response and <re> mineralization <er> ability of Sealapex®and <el> MTA <le> Fillapex® sealers. Twenty-four Wistar rats were divided into two groups: diabetic and non-diabetic. The materials were placed in polyethylene tubes and implanted into dorsal connective tissue of rats for 7 and 30 days. Six animals from each group received injection of calcein, alizarin, and oxytetracycline on days 7, 14, and 21, respectively. The animals were killed after 7 and 30 days and specimens were prepared for histologic analysis by staining with hematoxylin and eosin or Von Kossa or left unstained for polarized light or fluorescence microscopy. On day 7, inflammatory reactions were characterized. Moderate inflammatory responses were observed for all groups and on day 30, a mild inflammatory response against <el> MTA <le> Fillapex® and a moderate inflammatory response against Sealapex® were observed. Von Kossa-positive structures were observed in response to both materials and birefringent structures were observed upon polarized light analysis; these had no relation to the diabetic condition (p > 0.05). The fluorescence intensity was unaffected in diabetic rats (p > 0.05). 
Continuous treatment with parathyroid hormone (<el> PTH <le>) or excess endogenous <el> PTH <le> due to primary hyperparathyroidism causes increased bone resorption and, subsequently, decreased bone volume. Our previous studies showed that myeloid Elf-1-like factor (MEF) not only suppresses osteoblast differentiation through inhibition of Runx2 activity and other osteogenesis-related genes but also specifically increases the expression of Mab21, a potential transcriptional repressor of osteoblast differentiation. Here we show that the JNK1 pathway is involved in the MEF-mediated up-regulation of <re> Mab21 expression <er> due to <el> PTH <le> stimulation. <el> PTH <le> increased the transcription level of Mab21 in MG63 human osteoblastic cells, in contrast to the suppressive effect of TGFβ1. <el> PTH <le> phosphorylates serine residues of MEF as well as c-Jun, a known substrate of JNK1. By in vitro kinase assay, we confirmed that MEF is phosphorylated by JNK1, but not by ERK. Co-transfection of MEF with both MKK4 and JNK1 increased the promoter activity of Mab21 in CV1 cells significantly more than MEF alone. We also identified the phosphorylation of MEF serine 641 by in vitro and in vivo JNK1 kinase assays combined with a proteomics approach. 
Cocaine abuse disrupts reward and homeostatic processes through diverse processes, including those involved in circadian <re> clock <er> regulation. Recently we showed that <el> cocaine <le> administration to mice disrupts nocturnal photic phase resetting of the suprachiasmatic (SCN) circadian <re> clock <er>, whereas administration during the day induces non-photic phase shifts. Importantly, the same effects are seen when <el> cocaine <le> is applied to the SCN in vitro, where it blocks photic-like (glutamate-induced) phase shifts at night and induces phase advances during the day. Furthermore, our previous data suggest that <el> cocaine <le> acts in the SCN by enhancing 5-HT signaling. For example, the in vitro actions of <el> cocaine <le> mimic those of 5-HT and are blocked by the 5-HT antagonist, metergoline, but not the dopamine receptor antagonist, fluphenazine. Although our data are consistent with <el> cocaine <le> acting through enhanced 5-HT signaling, the nonselective actions of <el> cocaine <le> as an antagonist of monoamine transporters raises the question of whether inhibition of the 5-HT transporter (SERT) is key to its circadian effects. Here we investigate this issue using transgenic mice expressing a SERT that exhibits normal 5-HT recognition and transport but significantly reduced <el> cocaine <le> potency (SERT Met172). Circadian patterns of SCN behavioral and neuronal activity did not differ between wild-type (WT) and SERT Met172 mice, nor did they differ in the ability of the 5-HT1A,2,7 receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT to reset SCN <re> clock <er> phase, consistent with the normal SERT expression and activity in the transgenic mice. However, (1) <el> cocaine <le> administration does not induce phase advances when administered in vivo or in vitro in SERT Met172 mice; (2) <el> cocaine <le> does not block photic or glutamate-induced phase shifts in SERT Met172 mice; and (3) <el> cocaine <le> does not induce long-term changes in free-running period in SERT Met172 mice. 
Pyelonephritis is a risk factor for renal tubular epithelial cell damage in children. The inter- and intracellular regulator nitric oxide (NO) plays a role in the modulation of cellular viability in urinary tract infections, but the role of the NO pathway in renal proximal tubular-<re> cell death <er> remains unclear. The present study demonstrates that, in renal epithelial cells undergoing death mediated by Escherichia coli strain ARD6 serotype O6K13H1 (O6), levels of the phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (<el> ERK <le>) 1/2 and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) proteins are up-regulated, but levels of endothelial NO synthase are down-regulated. When NO synthase (NOS) activity is inhibited by the specific inhibitor of NOS or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, cells are prevented from death. Moreover, down-regulating protein 53 (p53) does not prevent the cells from dying, although p53 is up-regulated in O6-exposed cells. Up-regulation of heme oxygenase (HO)-1 by sodium nitroprusside or by the specific activator hemin inhibits <re> cell death <er>. 
Glucocorticoids are potent inhibitors of growth. In this work, we investigated whether glucocorticoids inhibit the stimulatory action of <el> GH <le> on <re> IGF-I gene expression <er> in rat hepatocytes. <el> GH <le> increased IGF-I mRNA levels 11-fold after 24 h, whereas high doses of DXM (10(-6)M) caused a slight (2.6-fold) increase of IGF-I mRNA levels. However, high doses of DXM (10(-6)M) inhibited the induction of IGF-I mRNA by <el> GH <le>. To assess the role of <el> GH <le>R in this inhibition, we investigated the regulation of <el> GH <le>R expression. High doses of DXM decreased <el> GH <le>R mRNA levels. 
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are known as ectopic bone inducers. The FDA approved BMPs (BMP2 and BMP7) for clinical use. However, direct effects of BMPs on endogenous bone metabolism are not yet well known. We conditionally disrupted BMP receptor type IA (<el> BMPRIA <le>) in osteoblasts during weanling and adult stages to show the impact of BMP signaling on endogenous bone modeling and remodeling. Cre recombination was detected in immature osteoblasts in the periosteum, osteoblasts, and osteocytes but not in chondrocytes and osteoclasts after tamoxifen administration. Bmpr1a conditional knockout mice (cKO) showed increased bone <re> mass <er> primarily in trabecular bone at P21 and 22 wk as determined by H&E staining. Vertebrae, tails, and ribs showed increased radiodensity at 22 wk, consistent with a significant increase in BMD. Both muCT and histomorphometry showed an increase in trabecular BV/TV and thickness of cKO adult bones, whereas osteoclast number, bone formation rate, and mineral apposition rate were decreased. Expression levels of bone formation markers (Runx2 and Bsp), resorption markers (Mmp9, Ctsk, and Tracp), and Rankl were decreased, and Opg was increased in adult bones, resulting in a reduction in the ratio of Rankl to osteoprotegerin (Opg). The reduction in osteoclastogenesis through the RANKL-OPG pathway was also observed in weanling stages and reproduced in newborn calvaria culture. These results suggest that Bmpr1a cKO increased endogenous bone <re> mass <er> primarily in trabecular bone with decreased osteoclastogenesis through the RANKL-OPG pathway. 
Combined BMP2 and cAMP signaling induces the catechola-minergic lineage in neural crest (NC) cultures by increasing expression of the proneural transcription factor Phox2a, in a cAMP response element (CRE)-binding protein (<el> CREB <le>)-mediated mechanism. To determine whether <el> CREB <le> acts directly on <re> Phox2a transcription <er> induced by BMP2+cAMP-elevating agent IBMX, transient transfections of hPhox2a-reporter constructs were performed in avian NC cultures and murine, catecholaminergic CAD cells. Although BMP2+IBMX increased endogenous Phox2a expression, the 7.5-kb hPhox2a reporters expressing either luciferase or DsRed1-E5 fluorescent protein were unresponsive to BMP2+IBMX, but active in both cell types. Cell sorting of fluorescence-positive NC cells expressing the 7.5-kb hPhox2a fluorescent timer reporter differentiated to equal numbers of catecholaminergic cells as fluorescence-negative cells, suggesting inappropriate transcription from the transfected hPhox2a promoter. NC or CAD cells treated with histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A and BMP2+IBMX display increased endogenous <re> Phox2a transcription <er> and prolonged <el> CREB <le> phosphorylation, indicating Phox2a chromatin remodeling is linked to <el> CREB <le> activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitations employing <el> CREB <le>, <el> CREB <le>-binding protein, and acetylated H4 antibodies identified two CRE half-sites at -5.5 kb in the murine Phox2a promoter, which is also conserved in the human promoter. Proximal to the CRE half-sites, within a 170-bp region, are E-box and CCAAT binding sites, also conserved in mouse and human genes. This 170-bp promoter region confers cAMP, BMP2, and enhanced BMP2+cAMP regulation to Phox2a-luciferase reporters. 
Human DMP1 mutations or Dmp1-null (KO) mice display <el> hypophosphatemia <le> rickets, suggesting a causative role of low phosphate (P) in development of <re> osteomalacia <er>. To address the direct contribution of P to the in vivo bone mineralization we analyzed the properties of femurs obtained from Dmp1 null mice and wild type (WT) mice under a normal or high phosphorous (HiP) diet using combined assays, including histological examination, micro computed tomography (μCT), X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Histology and XANES indicate that WT mice have phosphate coordinated with Ca in the form of hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate, while the KO mice have poorly coordinated soluble phosphates in their structure in both the normal and HiP diets. Raman spectroscopy and XANES indicate a higher carbonate/phosphate ratio and a low mineral/matrix ratio in the osteoid clusters in the KO femurs, which was only partially improved by HiP diets. 
The present experiments were aimed at determining whether acetylcholine (ACh) plays a role in encoding and retrieval of spatial information using a modified Hebb-Williams maze. In addition, the present experiments tested two computational models of hippocampal function during encoding and retrieval using a maze sensitive to hippocampal disruption. Thirty male, Long-Evans rats served as subjects. Chronic cannulae were implanted bilaterally into the CA3 (n=26) and <re> CA1 <er> (n=5) subregions of the hippocampus. Rats were tested using a modified Hebb-Williams maze. In the first experiment, rats were injected with either saline or <el> scopolamine <le> hydrobromide 10 min before testing for each day. The number of errors made per day per group was used as the measure of learning. Encoding was assessed by the average number of errors made on the first five trials of Day 1 compared to the last five trials of Day 1, whereas the average number of errors made on the first five trials of Day 2 compared to the last five trials of Day I was used to assess retrieval. No deficit was found for the saline group. The <el> scopolamine <le> group showed a deficit in encoding, but not retrieval. In the second experiment, rats were injected with either saline or physostigmine 10 min before testing each day. In contrast to the <el> scopolamine <le> groups, the physostigmine group showed a deficit in retrieval, but not encoding. To test whether the retrieval deficit was due to a disruption in storage or gaining access to the information two groups of rats received either saline on Day 1 and physostigmine on Day 2 or physostigmine on Day 1 and saline on Day 2. In addition, one group received physostigmine immediately after testing on Day 1. Data indicate that physostigmine causes a disruption of retrieval by means of a disruption in consolidation process. 
Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit PMN aggregation, chemotaxis, degranulation, and superoxide anion production stimulated by synthetic formyl peptides. Many of these functions are dependent upon receptors for the complement components C3b and iC3b (CD35 and <re> CD11b <er>, respectively), or the adherence molecules <re> CD11b <er> and CD11c. Using flow cytometry and specific monoclonal antibodies, we studied the effects of the NSAID <el> piroxicam <le> and indomethacin on the upregulation of these cell surface proteins on PMNs stimulated with FMLP, C5a, or ionomycin. Incubation of PMNs at 37 degrees C increased the expression of all three of these surface proteins. A further increase was induced by stimulation with FMLP, C5a, or ionomycin. Both <el> piroxicam <le> and indomethacin inhibited FMLP-induced upregulation of <re> CD11b <er>, CD11c, and CD35, but neither drug affected the upregulation of these surface molecules induced by C5a or ionomycin. Furthermore, <el> piroxicam <le> had no effect on 37 degrees C-induced upregulation of any of the surface proteins, while indomethacin showed no effect on 37 degrees C-induced <re> CD11b <er> upregulation but suppressed CD11c and CD35 upregulation. Inhibition of surface protein upregulation by FMLP was not due to inhibition of FMLP binding to PMNs. 
The reciprocal modulation of platelet and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) activities is important in the pathogenesis of thrombosis and <re> inflammation <er>. This study investigated how moderate exercise affects shear-induced platelet activation and subsequent PMNs interaction with platelet-related thrombi under shear flow. Sixteen sedentary healthy men engaged in moderate exercise (about 60% VO(2max)) on a bicycle ergometer. Platelet activation, PMNs interaction with surface-adherent platelets, and PMN-dependent inhibition of platelet activation under shear flow were measured both before and immediately after exercise. The results of this study can be summarized as follows: (1) moderate exercise was associated with lower extents of shear-induced platelet <el> adhesion <le> and aggregation, binding of von Willbrand factor (vWF) to platelets, and glyco-protein IIb/IIIa activation and P-selectin expression on platelet than at rest; (2) the velocity and percentage of rolling PMNs increased while the number of PMNs remaining bound to surface-adherent platelets decreased after moderate exercise; (3) although treating the PMNs with oxidized-low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) enhanced PMNs interaction with surface-adherent platelets, moderate exercise suppressed the enhancement of platelet-PMN interaction by Ox-LDL; (4) moderate exercise decreased platelet [Ca (2+)](i) elevation induced by ADP and platelet [Ca(2+)](i) levels mediated by PMN and Ox-LDL-treated PMN; and (5) plasma and PMN-derived nitric oxide metabolites and plasma vWF antigen and activity increased after moderate exercise, whereas plasma and platelet-derived soluble P-selectin levels remained unchanged in response to exercise. 
We have previously reported on the basic pharmacologic properties of <el> SC-52458 <le> (5-[(3,5-dibutyl-1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl) methyl]-2-[2-(1H-tetrazol-5-ylphenyl)]pyridine), a novel angiotensin (AII) receptor antagonist that binds potently to AT1 receptors in rat adrenal cortex and blocks AII-mediated contraction in isolated rabbit aorta. In the present study, the ability of <el> SC-52458 <le> to block AII pressor responses in conscious dogs was measured. In addition, we determined whether <el> SC-52458 <le> lowered mean arterial pressure in dogs with 2 kidney/1 <re> clip <er> renal hypertension when given daily for 4 days. In conscious, normotensive dogs, <el> SC-52458 <le> at 30 mg/kg orally, blocked the pressor response to AII (50 ng/kg, intravenously) with maximal inhibition (91%) observed 2 h after dosing. Plasma concentrations of <el> SC-52458 <le> measured by HPLC also were highest at the 2-h time point. After 24 h, the AII pressor response remained inhibited (by 35%) and <el> SC-52458 <le> was still measurable in plasma from treated dogs. In dogs made hypertensive by constriction of the left renal artery, <el> SC-52458 <le> lowered mean arterial pressure compared to vehicle treatment although heart rate was not different in the two groups. The maximal blood pressure lowering achieved with <el> SC-52458 <le> was similar to the maximal effect observed with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril. 
Hop/STI1 is a co-chaperone adaptor protein for Hsp70/Hsp90 complexes. Hop/STI1 is found extracellularly and modulates <re> cell death <er> and differentiation through interaction with the prion protein (PrP(C)). Here, we investigated the expression of <el> hop <le>/STI1 and its role upon cell proliferation and <re> cell death <er> in the developing retina. Hop/STI1 is more expressed in developing rat retina than in the mature tissue. Hop/STI1 blocks retinal <re> cell death <er> in the neuroblastic layer (NBL) in a PrP(C) dependent manner, but failed to protect ganglion cells against axotomy-induced <re> cell death <er>. An antibody raised against <el> hop <le>/STI1 (alpha-STI1) blocked both ganglion cell and NBL <re> cell death <er> independent of PrP(C). cAMP/PKA, ERK, PI3K and PKC signaling pathways were not involved in these effects. Hop/STI1 treatment reduced proliferation, while alpha-STI1 increased proliferation in the developing retina, both independent of PrP(C). 
Background Determination of the role of steroid hormones in expression and regulation of endometrial glucose transport 4 (GLUT4) in humans is important for understanding endometrial disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormone-imbalance disease. Methods Endometrial biopsy samples were collected from non-PCOS patients with regular menstrual cycles or with hyperplasia and from PCOS patients with or without hyperplasia. In addition, endometrial tissues from postmenopausal women were incubated with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, 10 IU/ml), 17β-estradiol (E2, 10 nM), progesterone (<el> P4 <le>, 100 nM), or a combination of E2 and <el> P4 <le> for 24 h. The expression of GLUT4 was measured at the mRNA level using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and at the protein level using Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Results A cyclical change in <re> GLUT4 expression <er> pattern was observed in non-PCOS patients, and a high level of <re> GLUT4 expression <er> was seen in the proliferative phase compared to the secretory phase. Low levels of <re> GLUT4 expression <er> were found in PCOS patients compared to menstrual cycle phase-matched non-PCOS patients, and there was no significant change in <re> GLUT4 expression <er> in PCOS patients during the menstrual cycle. GLUT4 was localized in both epithelial and stromal cells, with notable changes in epithelial cells. We postulate that decreased <re> GLUT4 expression <er> might be regulated by steroid hormones. In support of this, we showed that in cultured endometrial tissues hCG and E2 alone had no effect on <re> GLUT4 expression <er>. However, <el> P4 <le> alone and <el> P4 <le> in combination with E2 decreased <re> GLUT4 expression <er>. Compared with non-PCOS controls, PCOS patients with endometrial hyperplasia exhibited decreased <re> GLUT4 expression <er> in particular in the epithelial cells. 
Mutations in fibrillin-1 or fibrillin-2, the major structural components of extracellular microfibrils, cause pleiotropic manifestations in Marfan syndrome and congenital contractural arachnodactyly, respectively. We recently found that fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 control bone formation by regulating osteoblast differentiation through the differential modulation of endogenous TGFβ and bone morphogenetic protein signals. Here, we describe in vivo and ex vivo experiments that implicate the fibrillins as negative regulators of bone resorption. Adult <re> Fbn2 <er>(-/-) mice display a greater than normal osteolytic response to locally implanted lipopolysaccharide-coated titanium particles. Although isolated cultures of <re> Fbn2 <er>(-/-) preosteoclasts exhibited normal differentiation and activity, these features were substantially augmented when mutant or wild-type preosteoclasts were co-cultured with <re> Fbn2 <er>(-/-) but not wild-type osteoblasts. Greater osteoclastogenic potential of <re> Fbn2 <er>(-/-) osteoblasts was largely accounted for by up-regulation of the <el> Rankl <le> gene secondary to heightened TGFβ activity. 
P-glycoprotein (<el> Pgp <le>)-related multidrug resistance (<re> MDR <er>) is frequently observed in acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) and is associated with a poor response to standard chemotherapy. Cyclosporin A (CsA) is an effective downmodulator of <el> Pgp <le>-related <re> MDR <er> in vitro and has already been tested for that purpose in vivo also. Since <el> Pgp <le> is expressed in several normal cells and tissues, the modulation of <el> Pgp <le> can also modify total body exposure to antileukemic drugs and can alter and increase the toxicity of the antileukemic treatment. We report here the results of a study where 46 consecutive adult patients with ANLL were assigned to receive the same standard chemotherapy regimen of arabinosyl cytosine and idarubicin (IDA) for remission induction or consolidation, without or with CsA. Twenty-eight patients received 36 courses of chemotherapy without CsA and 18 patients received 32 courses of chemotherapy with CsA. CsA dose was 10-12.5 mg/kg/day and was given as a continuous i.v. infusion for 72 h. Whole blood CsA steady-state concentration ranged between 0.61 and 1.14 microM. The IDA area-under-the-curve was about twice as high in the cases that received CsA than in the other cases. CsA had no detectable effects on renal function and fluid balance, but significantly increased systemic blood diastolic pressure and conjugated bilirubine concentration. Furthermore, CsA-treated patients had greater, and more severe, oral and intestinal mucosal toxicity, with more severe adverse events, including more cases of gram-negative bacteremia, and with a delayed hemopoietic recovery. 
Many chemoattractants cause <re> chemotaxis <er> of leukocytes by stimulating a structurally distinct class of G protein-coupled receptors. To identify receptor functions required for <re> chemotaxis <er>, we studied <re> chemotaxis <er> in HEK293 cells transfected with receptors for nonchemokine ligands or for interleukin 8 (IL-8), a classical chemokine. In gradients of the appropriate agonist, three nonchemokine <el> Gi <le>-coupled receptors (the D2 dopamine receptor and opioid mu and delta receptors) mediated <re> chemotaxis <er>; the beta2-adrenoreceptor and the M3-muscarinic receptor, which couple respectively to Gs and Gq, did not mediate <re> chemotaxis <er>. A mutation deleting 31 C-terminal amino acids from the IL-8 receptor type B quantitatively impaired <re> chemotaxis <er> and agonist-induced receptor internalization, but not inhibition of adenylyl cyclase or stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. To probe the possible relation between receptor internalization and <re> chemotaxis <er>, we used two agonists of the mu-opioid receptor. Morphine and etorphine elicited quantitatively similar <re> chemotaxis <er>, but only etorphine induced receptor internalization. Overexpression of two betagamma sequestering proteins (betaARK-ct and alphat) prevented IL-8 receptor type B-mediated <re> chemotaxis <er> but did not affect inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by IL-8. 
Both <el> TWIST <le> and the endothelin-1 (ET-1)/endothelin A receptor (ETAR) signaling are important in osteosarcoma (OS) progression. In the present study, the interaction between <el> TWIST <le> and ET-1/ETAR signaling in OS cells was investigated, and the impact of the functional interaction on OS <re> cell survival <er> against chemotherapy agent-induced apoptosis was assessed. <el> TWIST <le> was overexpressed and knocked down in Saos-2 and MG-63 OS cells, respectively. In Saos-2 cells, overexpression of <el> TWIST <le> significantly decreased ET-1 mRNA and protein expression levels, <re> cell survival <er> against cisplatin and phosphorylation of Akt at serine 473 (ser473), which was abolished by the selective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, LY294002, or the selective ETAR inhibitor, BQ123. In MG-63 cells, knockdown of <el> TWIST <le> significantly increased ET-1 expression, <re> cell survival <er> against cisplatin and phosphorylation of Akt at ser473. However, exogenous ET-1 only partially rescued <re> cell survival <er> against cisplatin-induced apoptosis in the cells in which <el> TWIST <le> had been knocked down in the presence of LY294002. 
Galanin is co-localized with classical neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, serotonin (<el> 5-HT <le>) and noradrenaline (NA) in neurons or in brain regions implicated in cognitive and affective behaviour. In the present study, the effects of galanin on extracellular <el> 5-HT <le> and <re> NA levels <er> in the rat hippocampus were measured by in vivo microdialysis under basal conditions and following systemic administration of antidepressant drugs. Galanin (1.5 nmol i.c.v.) reduced basal <el> 5-HT <le> and <re> NA levels <er> to 65% and 86% of controls, respectively. Galanin (0.5 and 1.5 nmol i.c.v.) dose-dependently attenuated the elevation of <el> 5-HT <le> concentrations induced by imipramine and citalopram (10 mg/kg i.p., each) from 350% to 312% and from 230% to 160%, respectively. Galanin at 1.5 nmol transiently attenuated the effect of desipramine-induced (10 mg/kg i.p.) increase in extracellular <re> NA levels <er> from a maximal increase of 389-296% of the predrug levels. 
The effect of luminal <el> furosemide <le> on <re> calcium <er> transport across the cortical thick ascending limb of Henle's loop was studied. Cortical thick ascending limbs were dissected from rabbit kidneys and perfused in vitro. Calcium concentrations in perfused and collected tubule fluids were measured by continuous-flow microcolorimetry. Tubules were perfused at slow flow rates and parathyroid hormone was added to the bathing solution to maximize the difference between perfusate and collectate <re> calcium <er> concentrations. Furosemide simultaneously and reversibly inhibited the lumen-positive transepithelial voltage and <re> calcium <er> absorption. In the presence of <el> furosemide <le> perfusate-minus-collectate <re> calcium <er> concentration difference was smallest under conditions that minimized the residual transepithelial voltage. 
The present study was conducted to investigate the expression of miR-603 in <re> osteosarcoma <er> cells, and the effect of miR-603 on the biological behavior and expression of breast cancer cell 2 (<el> BRCC2 <le>) in <re> osteosarcoma <er> cells. In the present study, qRT-PCR was used to measure the levels of miRNA and mRNA. The results showed that miR-603 was significantly upregulated in human <re> osteosarcoma <er> tissues and cell lines. MTT and colony formation assays were employed to evaluate the role of miR-603 in the regulation of <re> osteosarcoma <er> cell proliferation. The results showed that overexpression of miR-603 promoted the proliferation of MG-63 and U2OS cells. Furthermore, a nude mouse subcutaneous tumor model indicated that miR-603 promoted <re> osteosarcoma <er> growth in vivo. Moreover, miR-603 expression levels were increased in patients with distant metastasis in comparison with levels in patients without distant metastasis. We discovered that <el> BRCC2 <le> may be a target of miR-603. Our results demonstrated that overexpression of miR-603 suppressed <el> BRCC2 <le> protein expression, and an miR-603 inhibitor enhanced <el> BRCC2 <le> protein expression as determined by western blot assay and immunohistochemical analysis. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed that <el> BRCC2 <le> is a direct target of miR-603 in <re> osteosarcoma <er> cells, and the results suggest that miR-603 downregulates <el> BRCC2 <le> expression in <re> osteosarcoma <er> via translational inhibition. Finally, we found that the reduction in <el> BRCC2 <le> expression induced by miR-603 was responsible for the enhanced colony formation and proliferative ability noted in the MG-63 and U2OS cells. 
Hyperprolactinemia impairs pituitary-gonadal function in young women, but its effect in menopausal women is not known. The purpose of this report is to describe the effect of <el> hyperprolactinemia <le> on <re> gonadotropin secretion <er> and hot flashes in menopausal women before and after treatment with a dopamine agonist. We studied two such women with prolactinomas. Both had plasma LH and FSH levels in the range found in premenopausal women and no hot flashes. Treatment with bromocriptine was associated with normalization of plasma PRL levels, elevation of plasma gonadotropin levels, and the onset of menopausal hot flashes in both patients. 
The effects of <el> magnesium deficiency <le> on low density lipoprotein (LDL) <re> transport <er> by cultured endothelial cells with a high concentration of LDL (2 mg of LDL cholesterol/ml) were investigated by electron microscopy and by counting the radioactivity of [3H]-LDL <re> transport <er>ed across an endothelial monolayer grown on culture plate inserts. Electron microscopic examination showed that the number of pits/vesicles in the apical side was time-dependently increased for 24 h in both magnesium-deficient and magnesium-sufficient groups with the exception of 1 h under magnesium sufficiency. The number of pits/vesicles in the basal side was also increased for 8 h in both groups, though there was a decrease at 24 h in the two groups. No difference between either magnesium group at the same time point was statistically significant. [3H]-LDL <re> transport <er> was also time-dependently increased in both magnesium-deficient and magnesium-sufficient groups. In contrast to the results obtained by electron microscopy, the amount of LDL <re> transport <er>ed under <el> magnesium deficiency <le> was much larger for 24 h than under magnesium sufficiency. Differences in LDL <re> transport <er> between magnesium groups were statistically significant at 4 and 8 h. This finding indicates that <el> magnesium deficiency <le> increases LDL <re> transport <er> across the endothelial monolayer. The increase may be due to energy-dependent movement across endothelial cells, energy-independent movement between cells, or both. 
This study was undertaken to determine whether <el> atherosclerosis <le> impairs relaxations mediated by endothelium-derived relaxing factor (<re> EDRF <er>) in human coronary arteries. Epicardial coronary arteries were obtained from the hearts of cardiac transplantation patients with or without histologically documented coronary <el> atherosclerosis <le> (atherosclerotic arteries were from patients aged 42-55 years, nonatherosclerotic arteries were from patients aged 14-24 years). Transverse strip preparations were mounted in organ baths for isometric tension recording. Tension was induced with prostaglandins F2 alpha. Indomethacin (10(-5) M) was present to prevent possible interference from endogenously formed prostaglandins. The <re> EDRF <er>-mediated relaxations in response to substance P (10(-10) to 10(-8) M), bradykinin (10(-9) to 10(-7) M), and Ca2+-ionophore A23187 (10(-9) to 10(-7) M) were significantly attenuated in atherosclerotic arteries. In deendothelialized tissues these compounds had no effect. In contrast, endothelium-independent relaxations induced by isoprenaline (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) were not affected by <el> atherosclerosis <le>. Atherosclerotic arteries showed also normal relaxations with high concentrations of glyceryl trinitrate (10(-8) to 10(-7) M), but reduced relaxations with a lower concentration of the compound (10(-9) M). Acetylcholine (10(-7) to 10(-6) M) only produced endothelium-dependent relaxations in 8 of 60 arterial preparations (with or without <el> atherosclerosis <le>). In most of the arteries, it was a direct vasoconstrictor (which may have masked <re> EDRF <er> release in many cases). Omission of indomethacin from the bath solution increased the incidence of moderate acetylcholine-induced relaxations (9 of 16 preparations). 
Extracellular matrix (<re> ECM <er>) remodeling is the hallmark of hypertensive nephropathy. Uncontrolled proteolytic activity due to an imbalance between matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (<el> MMP <le>s/TIMPs) has been implicated in renovascular fibrosis. We hypothesized that inhibition of <el> MMP <le>s will reduce excess <re> ECM <er> deposition and modulate autophagy to attenuate hypertension. Dahl-salt sensitive (Dahl/SS) and Lewis rats were fed on high salt diet and treated without or with 1.2 mg/kg b.w. of GM6001 (<el> MMP <le> inhibitor) by intra-peritoneal injection on alternate days for 4 weeks. Blood pressure, renal cortical blood flow, vascular density, collagen, elastin and <el> MMP <le>s/TIMPs were measured. GM6001 treatment significantly reduced mean blood pressure in hypertensive Dahl/SS rats. Renal resistive index was increased in hypertensive Dahl/SS rats and Doppler flowmetry showed reduced cortical perfusion. Barium angiography demonstrated a reduction in terminal branches of renal vasculature. Inhibition of <el> MMP <le>s by GM6001 resulted in a significant improvement in all the parameters including renal function. In hypertensive Dahl/SS rats, protein levels of <el> MMP <le>-9, -2 and -13 were increased including the activity of <el> MMP <le>-9 and -2; TIMP-1 and -2 levels were increased whereas, TIMP-3 levels were similar to Lewis controls. Administration of GM6001 reduced the activity of <el> MMP <le>s and increased the levels of TIMP-1, -2 and -3. <el> MMP <le> inhibition reduced type -1 collagen deposition and increased elastin in the intra-renal vessels indicating reduced fibrosis. Autophagy markers were decreased in hypertensive Dahl/SS rats and GM6001 treatment enhanced their levels. 
Calcitonin is present in both the hypothalamus and pituitary of the rat, and normal rat anterior pituitary cells express calcitonin receptors. Calcitonin has been reported to inhibit or to stimulate <re> PRL release <er> from rat anterior pituitary cells. We have investigated the effects of salmon calcitonin on basal and stimulated <re> PRL release <er> from rat anterior pituitary cells and have studied the effects of this peptide on the intracellular biochemical pathways involved in <re> PRL release <er>. Salmon calcitonin had no significant effect on basal <re> PRL release <er>, but inhibited (P less than 0.01) <el> TRH <le>-stimulated <re> PRL release <er> without affecting <re> PRL release <er> promoted by angiotensin II, neurotensin, phorbol myristate acetate (a protein kinase C activator), or maitotoxin (a calcium channel activator). Salmon calcitonin had no effect on the increase in <re> PRL release <er> and intracellular cAMP concentration after exposure of pituitary cells to vasoactive intestinal peptide or forskolin. Salmon calcitonin significantly decreased (P less than 0.01) the <el> TRH <le>-stimulated rise in inositol phosphates without affecting the angiotensin II-stimulated increase in inositol phosphates. Similarly, salmon calcitonin decreased the <el> TRH <le>-stimulated increase in cytosolic calcium and arachidonate liberation by pituitary cells. 
Cyclooxygenase (prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin I2) and lipoxygenase [8(R), 15(S)-dihydroxyicosa-(5E-9,11,13Z)-tetraenoic acid] products of arachidonic acid metabolism are thought to produce peripheral <re> hyperalgesia <er> by a direct action on the primary afferent nociceptor. In this study we investigated the possibility that these eicosanoids generate <re> hyperalgesia <er> through a common second messenger in the rat. We report that 8-bromo <el> cAMP <le>, a membrane permeable analogue of <el> cAMP <le>, produces a dose-dependent <re> hyperalgesia <er> that is not affected by treatments that interrupt indirect routes of <re> hyperalgesia <er> production including sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine, depletion of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (a source of hyperalgesic eicosanoids) with hydroxyurea, or blockade of the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism with indomethacin. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutyl-methylxanthine markedly prolongs the hyperalgesic effect of 8-bromo <el> cAMP <le> as well as those of the directly acting hyperalgesic agents prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin I2 and 8(R),15(S)-dihydroxyicosa-(5E-9,11,13Z)-tetraenoic acid. 
Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes express both beta 1-and beta 2-adrenergic receptors linked to enhanced intracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (<re> cAMP <er>) accumulation and the modulation of contractile function. This study tests the hypothesis that muscarinic agonists act via distinct mechanisms to interfere with beta 1-and beta 2-adrenergic receptor actions. The beta 2-selective agonist zinterol (10(-7) M) elicits approximately a fourfold increase in <re> cAMP <er> accumulation, which is mimicked, both in magnitude and kinetics, by 10(-9) M of the mixed <el> beta 1-receptor <le> agonist/beta 2-receptor agonist isoproterenol. At these concentrations, isoproterenol and zinterol elicit equivalent inotropic and lusitropic (i.e., enhanced relaxation) responses. Carbachol inhibits all three responses (<re> cAMP <er>, inotropic, and lusitropic) elicited by isoproterenol. In contrast, carbachol does not interfere with the effect of zinterol to augment <re> cAMP <er> accumulation or to induce a positive inotropic response. However, carbachol inhibits the lusitropic response to zinterol via an action at an M2-muscarinic receptor linked to a pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway. Additional studies indicate that beta 2-receptor-dependent phosphorylation of troponin I and phospholamban is substantially attenuated by carbachol. 
A(2A) adenosine receptor (A(2A)<el> AR <le>) has been shown to suppress superoxide generation in leukocytes via the cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. However, no study has yet explored the role of A(2A)<el> AR <le> in relation to <re> NADPH oxidase <er> in murine tracheas in vitro, which may lead to altered smooth muscle relaxation in asthma. Therefore, the present study evaluated the effects of A(2A)<el> AR <le> deficiency on the <re> NADPH oxidase <er> pathway in tracheas of A(2A) wild-type (WT) and A(2A) knockout (KO) mice. A(2A)WT mice were sensitized with ovalbumin (30 microg i.p.) on days 1 and 6, followed by 5% ovalbumin aerosol challenge on days 11, 12, and 13. A(2A)<el> AR <le> (gene and protein expression), cAMP, and phosphorylated PKA (p-PKA) levels were decreased in A(2A)WT sensitized mice compared with controls. A(2A)KO mice also showed decreased cAMP and p-PKA levels. A(2A)WT sensitized and A(2A)KO control mice had increased gene and protein expression of <re> NADPH oxidase <er> subunits (p47phox and gp91phox) compared with the controls. Tracheal relaxation to specific A(2A)<el> AR <le> agonist, 4-[2-[[6-amino-9-(N-ethyl-beta-d-ribofuranuronamidosyl)-9H-purin-2-yl]amino]ethyl]benzenepropanoic acid hydrochloride (CGS 21680), decreased in A(2A)WT sensitized mice compared with the controls, although it was absent in A(2A)KO mice. Pretreatment with <re> NADPH oxidase <er> inhibitors apocyanin/diphenyliodonium reversed the attenuated relaxation to CGS 21680 in A(2A)WT sensitized tracheas, whereas specific PKA inhibitor (9S,10S,12R)-2,3,9,10,11,12-hexahydro-10-hydroxy-9-methyl-1-oxo-9,12-epoxy-1H-diindolo[1,2,3-fg:3',2',1'-kl]pyrrolo[3,4-i] [1,6]benzodiazocine-10-carboxylic acid hexyl ester (KT 5720) blocked CGS 21680-induced relaxation. Tracheal reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was also increased in A(2A)WT sensitized and A(2A)KO control mice compared with the controls. 
Paclitaxel triggers suicidal erythrocyte death or eryptosis, characterized by exposure of phosphatidylserine at the erythrocyte surface and cell shrinkage. Eryptosis of infected erythrocytes may delay development of parasitemia and thus favourably influence the course of malaria. The present study explored whether <el> paclitaxel <le> influences in vitro parasite growth and eryptosis of Plasmodium falciparum infected human erythrocytes and in vivo parasitemia and survival of Plasmodium berghei infected <re> mice <er>. Phosphatidylserine exposing erythrocytes were identified utilizing annexin V binding and erythrocyte volume was estimated from forward scatter in FACS analysis. In vitro infection of human erythrocytes with P. falciparum increased annexin binding and decreased forward scatter, effects augmented in the presence of <el> paclitaxel <le> (> or = 0.01 microM). Paclitaxel (> or = 0.01 microM) significantly decreased intraerythrocytic DNA/RNA content and in vitro parasitemia. In Plasmodium berghei infected <re> mice <er> parasitemia was significantly decreased (from 55.8% to 28.6% of circulating erythrocytes 20 days after infection) and mouse survival significantly enhanced (from 0% to 69.23% 25 days after infection) by administration of 8.5 mg/kg.b.w. of <el> paclitaxel <le> intraperitoneally from the eighth day of infection. 
Exposure of proestrous Syrian hamsters to a new room, cage, and novel running wheel blocks the luteinizing hormone (<re> LH <er>) surge until the next day in ~75% of hamsters [1]. The studies described here tested the hypotheses that 1) exercise and/or 2) <el> orexin <le>ergic neurotransmission mediate novel wheel blockade of the <re> LH <er> surge and circadian phase advances. Female hamsters were exposed to a 14L:10D photoperiod and activity rhythms were monitored with infra-red detectors. In Expt. 1, to test the effect of exercise, hamsters received jugular cannulae and on the next day, proestrus (Day 1), shortly before zeitgeber time 5 (ZT 5, 7h before lights-off) the hamsters were transported to the laboratory. After obtaining a blood sample at ZT 5, the hamsters were transferred to a new cage with a novel wheel that was either freely rotating (unlocked), or locked until ZT 9, and exposed to constant darkness (DD). Blood samples were collected hourly for 2days from ZT 5-11 under red light for determination of plasma <re> LH <er> levels by radioimmunoassay. Running rhythms were monitored continuously for the next 10-14days. The locked wheels were as effective as unlocked wheels in blocking <re> LH <er> surges (no Day 1 <re> LH <er> surge in 6/9 versus 8/8 hamsters, P>0.05) and phase advances in the activity rhythms did not differ between the groups (P=0.28), suggesting that intense exercise is not essential for novel wheel blockade and phase advance of the proestrous <re> LH <er> surge. Expt. 2 tested whether <el> orexin <le> neurotransmission is essential for these effects. Hamsters were treated the same as those in Expt. 1 except that they were injected (i.p.) at ZT 4.5 and 5 with either the <el> orexin <le> 1 receptor antagonist SB334867 (15mg/kg per injection) or vehicle (25% DMSO in 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HCD)). SB-334867 inhibited novel wheel blockade of the <re> LH <er> surge (surges blocked in 2/6 SB334867-injected animals versus 16/18 vehicle-injected animals, P<0.02) and also inhibited wheel running and circadian phase shifts, indicating that activation of <el> orexin <le> 1 receptors is necessary for these effects. Expt. 3 tested the hypothesis that novel wheel exposure activates <el> orexin <le> neurons. Proestrous hamsters were transferred at ZT 5 to a nearby room within the animal facility and were exposed to a new cage with a locked or unlocked novel wheel or left in their home cages. At ZT 8, the hamsters were anesthetized, blood was withdrawn, they were perfused with fixative and brains were removed for immunohistochemical localization of Fos, GnRH, and <el> orexin <le>. Exposure to a wheel, whether locked or unlocked, suppressed circulating <re> LH <er> concentrations at ZT 8, decreased the proportion of Fos-activated GnRH neurons, and increased Fos-immunoreactive <el> orexin <le> cells. Unlocked wheels had greater effects than locked wheels on all three endpoints. Thus in a familiar environment, exercise potentiated the effect of the novel wheel on Fos expression because a locked wheel was not a sufficient stimulus to block the <re> LH <er> surge. 
To study the effects of human recombinant interleukin-1 on thyrocytes, we cultured thyroid follicles as semi-organs, each consisting of approximately 10-20 follicles, in the presence or absence of <el> IL-1 <le> alpha or beta. Semi-organ culture reproduces the in vivo environment well. After culture for 2 or 4 days, the follicles were incubated with <re> TSH <er> (10 U/l) for 4 h and fixed for light and electron microscopical examinations. Regardless of the presence or absence of <el> IL-1 <le>, follicular structure, polarity, and luminal colloid did not change during culture. In thyroid epithelial cells cultured without <el> IL-1 <le>, <re> TSH <er> markedly induced elongation of microvilli and formation of reabsorbed colloid droplets. On the other hand, both <el> IL-1 <le> alpha and beta inhibited these <re> TSH <er>-stimulated changes. The degree of inhibition correlated with the concentration of exposure to <el> IL-1 <le>. 
Alkylglycerols, inflammation products of lipids in cancerous tissues, are potent macrophage stimulating agents. Administration of small amounts (10-100 ng) of alkylglycerols to mice greatly enhanced <re> macrophage activation <er> for Fc-mediated ingestion activity at the 5th day posttreatment. Dose effect analysis revealed that dodecylglycerol (<el> DDG <le>), one of the alkylglycerols, stimulates macrophages most effectively at the dose of 100 ng/mouse. Administration of lower concentrations of a longer carbon chained alkylglycerol, sn-3-octadecylglycerol (batyl alcohol), to mice produced a similar activation of macrophages. In vitro incubation of mouse peritoneal cells with 50 ng <el> DDG <le>/ml efficiently stimulated macrophages for Fc-mediated ingestion activity. However, in vitro treatment of macrophages alone with <el> DDG <le> was unable to stimulate ingestion activity. When a mixture of macrophages and nonadherent (B and T) cells was treated with <el> DDG <le>, a greatly enhanced Fc-mediated ingestion was observed at about 3 h posttreatment, suggesting that nonadherent cells contributed to the activation of macrophages. Since coincubation of these cells with <el> DDG <le> is required for <re> macrophage activation <er>, stepwise stimulation processes by exchanging signaling factor(s) among these cell types were considered for the developmental mechanism of ingestion capacity of macrophages. When a conditioned medium of <el> DDG <le>-treated B- or T-cells was admixed with macrophages and incubated for 3 h, no significantly enhanced ingestion activity of macrophages was observed. Thus, exchange of signaling factor(s) among B- and T-cells was analyzed by transferring conditioned media of <el> DDG <le>-treated B- or T-cells to untreated T- or B-cells. When the resultant (treated B-cells----untreated T-cells conditioned medium was admixed with untreated macrophages and incubated for 3 h, a markedly enhanced Fc-mediated ingestion was observed. However, no significant increase in ingestion activity was found in macrophages incubated with the treated T-cell----untreated B-cell conditioned medium. 
The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (<el> PDC <le>) converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and is an important control-point for carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation. However, the importance of the <el> PDC <le> and CHO oxidation to muscle metabolism and exercise performance, particularly during prolonged or high-intensity exercise, has not been fully defined, especially in mature skeletal muscle. To this end, we determined whether skeletal muscle-specific loss of pyruvate dehydrogenase alpha 1 (Pdha1), which is a critical subunit of the <el> PDC <le>, impacts resting energy metabolism, exercise performance or metabolic adaptation to high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. For this, we generated a tamoxifen (TMX)-inducible Pdha1 knockout (PDHmKO) mouse, in which <el> PDC <le> activity is temporally and specifically ablated in adult skeletal muscle. We assessed <re> energy expenditure <er>, ex vivo muscle contractile performance and endurance exercise capacity in PDHmKO mice and wild-type (WT) littermates. Additionally, we studied glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in muscle after 12 weeks HFD feeding. TMX administration largely ablated PDHα in skeletal muscle of adult PDHmKO mice, but did not impact <re> energy expenditure <er>, muscle contractile function or low-intensity exercise performance. Additionally, there were no differences in muscle insulin sensitivity or body composition in PDHmKO mice fed a control or HFD, as compared to WT mice. However, exercise capacity during high-intensity exercise was severely impaired in PDHmKO mice, in parallel with a large increase in plasma lactate concentration. 
The injection of the 145-2C11 anti-CD3 MoAb in mice induces a polyclonal T cell activation resulting in the release of several cytokines, including interferon-gamma (<el> IFN-gamma <le>) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). As these cytokines are known to be involved in the host defence against Trypanosoma cruzi, we measured serum levels of <el> IFN-gamma <le> and TNF-alpha after injection of the 145-2C11 MoAb in the course of experimental murine Chagas' disease. Compared with control mice, T. cruzi-infected BALB/c mice were found to be primed to secrete very high levels of <el> IFN-gamma <le> and TNF-alpha from the second and the first week of infection, respectively, up to the chronic phase. In vivo cell depletion experiments indicated that CD8+ T cells were responsible for these dramatic hyperproductions of <el> IFN-gamma <le> and TNF-alpha. While all control mice survived anti-CD3 MoAb injection, a high lethality rate was observed in T. cruzi-infected mice within 24 h after anti-CD3 MoAb challenge. Pretreatment with neutralizing anti-<el> IFN-gamma <le> MoAb or depletion of CD8+ T cell population dramatically decreased the mortality induced by anti-CD3 MoAb in T. cruzi-infected mice. Finally, we showed that anti-CD3 MoAb injection in T. cruzi-infected mice was followed by a massive release of nitric oxide (NO) metabolites, which was partially reduced by <el> IFN-gamma <le> or TNF-alpha neutralization. The administration of the NO synthase inhibitor N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) before anti-CD3 MoAb challenge did not prevent and even enhanced lethality in T. cruzi-infected mice, suggesting that NO overproduction and lethal <re> shock <er> are not causally related. 
A role for the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-beta (PPARbeta) in oncogenesis has been suggested by a number of observations but its precise role remains elusive. Prostaglandin I2 (<el> <re> PGI2 <er> <le>, prostacyclin), a major arachidonic acid (AA) derived cyclooxygenase (Cox) product, has been proposed as a PPARbeta agonist. Here, we show that the 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) mediated activation of a C-Raf-estrogen receptor fusion protein leads to the induction of both the PPARbeta and Cox-2 genes, concomitant with a dramatic increase in <el> <re> PGI2 <er> <le> synthesis. Surprisingly, however, 4-OHT failed to activate PPARbeta transcriptional activity, indicating that <el> <re> PGI2 <er> <le> is insufficient for PPARbeta activation. 
In metabolic acidosis, the capacity of the proximal tubule for bicarbonate absorption is enhanced, whereas <re> NaCl <er> reabsorption is inhibited. Recent evidence indicates that transcellular <re> NaCl <er> absorption in the proximal tubule is mediated by apical membrane Cl/formate exchange and Cl/oxalate exchange, in parallel with recycling of these <el> organic anion <le>s. We evaluated whether the effect of metabolic acidosis to inhibit <re> NaCl <er> reabsorption in the proximal tubule is due at least in part to inhibition of <el> organic anion <le>-dependent <re> NaCl <er> transport in this nephron segment. Absorption rates of bicarbonate (JHCO3), chloride (JCl), and fluid (Jv) were measured in rat proximal tubule segments microperfused in situ. We confirmed that metabolic acidosis stimulates JHCO3 in tubules microperfused with 25 mM HCO3, pH 7.4. For measurements of JCl, tubules were microperfused with a low-bicarbonate (5 mM), high-chloride solution, simulating conditions in the late proximal tubule. Under these conditions, baseline JCl and Jv measured in the absence of formate and oxalate were not significantly different between control and acidotic rats. However, whereas addition of 50 ¿M formate or 1 ¿M oxalate to luminal and capillary perfusates markedly stimulated JCl and Jv in control rats, formate and oxalate failed to stimulate JCl and Jv in acidotic rats. 
Hyperosmotic <el> shock <le>, energy depletion, or removal of extracellular Cl(-) activates Ca(2+)-permeable cation channels in erythrocyte membranes. Subsequent Ca(2+) entry induces erythrocyte shrinkage and exposure of phosphatidylserine (<re> PS <er>) at the erythrocyte surface. <re> PS <er>-exposing cells are engulfed by macrophages. The present study explored the signalling involved. Hyperosmotic <el> shock <le> and Cl(-) removal triggered the release of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)). In whole-cell recording, activation of the cation channels by Cl(-) removal was abolished by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor diclophenac. In FACS analysis, phospholipase-A(2) inhibitors quinacrine and palmitoyltrifluoromethyl-ketone, and cyclooxygenase inhibitors acetylsalicylic acid and diclophenac, blunted the increase of <re> PS <er> exposure following Cl(-) removal. PGE(2) (but not thromboxane) induced cation channel activation, increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration, cell shrinkage, <re> PS <er> exposure, calpain activation, and ankyrin-R degradation. The latter was attenuated by calpain inhibitors-I/II, while PGE(2)-induced <re> PS <er> exposure was not. 
There is evidence that <el> dopamine <le> transmission is involved in reinforcement processes and the present study investigated the relative involvement of D3 versus D2 <el> dopamine <le> receptors in the effects of <el> dopamine <le> ligands on the reinforcing action of <re> ethanol <er>. Rats were trained to self-administer <re> ethanol <er> (10% v/v) orally in a free-choice two-lever operant task using a saccharin-fading procedure. When preference in responding for <re> ethanol <er> over water had developed the rats were tested with several <el> dopamine <le> agonists and antagonists. Pretreatment with the non-selective <el> dopamine <le> agonist, apomorphine (0.01-0.1 mg/kg), the preferential D2 agonist, bromocriptine (1-10 mg/kg) and the selective D3 agonists, 7-OH-DPAT (0.003-0.1 mg/kg), PD 128907 (0.1-3 mg/kg), (+)3PPP (0.3-3 mg/kg), quinelorane (0.0001-0.003 mg/kg) and quinpirole (0.003-0.03 mg/kg), resulted in dose-dependent decreases in responding for <re> ethanol <er>. The relative potencies of the <el> dopamine <le> agonists to decrease <re> ethanol <er> self-administration were highly correlated with their published potencies to produce in vitro functional D3 but not D2 responses. Active doses could be considered as those selectively stimulating receptors involved in the control of <el> dopamine <le> release, suggesting that reduction of <el> dopamine <le> transmission was associated with a decrease in <re> ethanol <er>-reinforced responding. 
The <re> x2 <er> glycosphingolipid is expressed on erythrocytes from individuals of all common blood group phenotypes and elevated on cells of the rare P/P1/P(k)-negative p blood group phenotype. Globoside or P antigen is synthesized by <el> UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine <le>:globotriaosyl-ceramide 3-β-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase encoded by B3GALNT1. It is the most abundant non-acid glycosphingolipid on erythrocytes and displays the same terminal disaccharide, GalNAcβ3Gal, as <re> x2 <er>. We encountered a patient with mutations in B3GALNT1 causing the rare P-deficient P1 (k) phenotype and whose pretransfusion plasma was unexpectedly incompatible with p erythrocytes. The same phenomenon was also noted in seven other unrelated P-deficient individuals. Thin-layer chromatography, mass spectrometry, and flow cytometry were used to show that the naturally occurring antibodies made by p individuals recognize <re> x2 <er> and sialylated forms of <re> x2 <er>, whereas <re> x2 <er> is lacking on P-deficient erythrocytes. Overexpression of B3GALNT1 resulted in synthesis of both P and <re> x2 <er>. Knockdown experiments with siRNA against B3GALNT1 diminished <re> x2 <er> levels. 
The detailed mechanism of how lysophosphatidylcholine (<el> LPC <le>) suppresses endothelium-dependent vasodilatation is unclear at present. We investigated the effects of <el> LPC <le> on endothelial intracellular calcium (<re> EC <er> [Ca(2+)](i)) signaling and vascular tone simultaneously using a new technique we developed. Fura-2-labeled rat aortic specimens were mounted in a tissue flow chamber and precontracted with phenylephrine (5 x 10(-8) M). Under either basal or agonist-stimulated conditions, the <re> EC <er> [Ca(2+)](i) level was calculated from fura 2 fluorescence ratio images, and the vascular tone was estimated by measuring the relative displacement of the fluorescence images. Although both acetylcholine (ACh)-induced <re> EC <er> [Ca(2+)](i) elevation and the concomitant vasorelaxation were partially suppressed in specimens pretreated with <el> LPC <le> (20 microM), the quantitative relationship between <re> EC <er> [Ca(2+)](i) elevation and the corresponding vasorelaxation was unaffected. A high concentration of <el> LPC <le> (40 microM) completely eliminated ACh-evoked [Ca(2+)](i) elevation and vasodilatation. It has been reported that exposing vascular tissue to a calcium-free buffer causes a reduction in the <re> EC <er> [Ca(2+)](i) level and the accompanying vasoconstriction. Pretreatment with 20 microM <el> LPC <le> reduced the basal <re> EC <er> [Ca(2+)](i) level and abolished the calcium-free solution-induced <re> EC <er> [Ca(2+)](i) reduction and vasoconstriction. 
Options for the management of infants with hyperkalemia secondary to renal insufficiency are limited for infants not maintained on dialysis. Precipitation of potassium (<re> K+ <er>) from infant formula with sodium polystyrene sulfonate (<el> KX <le>) prior to feeding has been reported. However, its effect on calcium (Ca2+) and sodium (Na+) has not been quantitatively defined. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of two <re> K+ <er> exchange resins: <el> KX <le> and calcium polystyrene sulfonate (RC) on Na+, <re> K+ <er>, and Ca2+. Infant formula powder (Similac PM 60/40, Ross Laboratories, Columbus, OH, USA) was prepared with deionized water (DW) and <el> KX <le> or RC (1 g/mEq of <re> K+ <er>) was added. The formula was decanted after 50 minutes and Na+, <re> K+ <er>, and Ca2+ were assayed in the supernatant. Na+ and <re> K+ <er> were also assayed in ready-to-feed PM 60/40 (RTF). <el> KX <le> decreased the <re> K+ <er> concentration by 4.5 fold (P < 0.001) and increased the Na+ content by 3.8 fold (P < 0.001). In RC there was a 1.6-fold increase in Ca2+ content (P < 0.001), and a 13% decrease in <re> K+ <er> concentrations (P < 0.05). Preparation of the formula with DW reduced the <re> K+ <er> concentration by 30% compared to ready-to-feed formula (P < 0.001). 
The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms that mediate <el> T-kinin <le>- (Ile-Ser-bradykinin) induced increases in <re> macromolecule <er> extravasation in the hamster cheek pouch. Changes in plasma extravasation were quantified by counting the number of leaky sites and calculating the clearance of fluorescein isothiocyanate- (FITC) dextran (mol mass = 70 kDa) during suffusion of the cheek pouch with <el> T-kinin <le> (0.1-1.0 microM) by using intravital microscopy. <el> T-kinin <le> induced a significant time- and concentration-dependent increase in leaky site formation and clearance of FITC-dextran (P < 0.05). The increase in plasma extravasation in response to <el> T-kinin <le> was mediated by two mechanisms: a COOH-terminal-mediated stimulation of B2 bradykinin receptors in postcapillary venules and an NH2-terminal-mediated degranulation of mast cells leading to histamine release. Indomethacin and CP 96345, a selective nonpeptide neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist, had no significant effects on <el> T-kinin <le>-induced responses. 
Lactotrophs, somatotrophs, and thyrotrophs have been shown to contain immunoreactive galanin. Furthermore, estrogen stimulates galanin mRNA and peptide levels in the rat anterior pituitary, particularly within lactotrophs. To determine whether galanin is released from the anterior pituitary in a regulated manner, we used cultured pituitary cells from male and ovariectomized Fischer 344 rats implanted with estrogen-containing capsules. Anterior pituitary cells (5 x 10(5) cells/well) were challenged (0.5-3 h) with hypothalamic factors known to regulate anterior pituitary hormone secretion, and medium galanin levels were measured by RIA. In female pituitary cells, <re> galanin secretion <er> was inhibited by dopamine (10 and 100 nM) and stimulated by TRH (20 and 100 nM). Although galanin release was significantly lower in male pituitary cells, dopamine and TRH inhibited and stimulated <re> galanin secretion <er>, respectively. Medium galanin levels were also significantly reduced by <el> somatostatin <le> (5 nM) in both female and male cells. The pattern of PRL release in response to dopamine, TRH, and <el> somatostatin <le> was similar to that observed for galanin, regardless of the sex of the pituitary donor. Although galanin has been localized in somatotrophs, 5 nM GH-releasing hormone (GRF) failed to alter galanin release in male as well as female pituitary cells; GH secretion was significantly increased by GRF. LHRH (5 nM) and CRF (5 nM) failed to alter galanin release in vitro. 
The suppressive role of phagocyte nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX2) complex-derived reactive oxygen species (<el> ROS <le>) in adaptive immunity-driven arthritis models is well established. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of NOX2 complex-derived <el> ROS <le> in a model of innate immunity-driven arthritis and to identify the <el> ROS <le>-regulated innate receptors that control arthritis. We used collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA), which is a T and B lymphocyte-independent model of the effector phase of arthritis and is induced by well-defined monoclonal arthritogenic antibodies and enhanced by injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). CAIA was induced in both wild-type and Ncf1 mutant mice that lack phagocyte oxidative burst, and stimulated with LPS and other agents to activate innate immune responses. We found that both LPS and lipomannan enhanced CAIA more potently in the presence of functional phagocyte <el> ROS <le> production than in its absence. The <el> ROS <le>-dependent enhancement of CAIA was regulated by <re> TLR2 <er>, but not by TLR4 stimulation, and was driven by granulocytes, whereas macrophages did not contribute to the phenotype. In addition, we report that collagen-induced arthritis was not affected by the functionality of the TLR4. 
Cholera toxin (<re> CT <er>) from Vibrio cholerae is responsible for the majority of the symptoms of the diarrheal disease cholera. <re> CT <er> is a heterohexameric protein complex with a 240-residue A subunit and a pentameric B subunit of identical 103-residue B polypeptides. The A subunit is proteolytically cleaved within a disulfide-linked loop to generate the A1 and A2 fragments. The B subunit of wild-type (wt) <re> CT <er> binds 5 cell surface ganglioside GM(1) (GM(1)) molecules, and the toxin-GM(1) complex traffics from the plasma membrane (PM) retrograde through endosomes and the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). From the ER, the enzymatic A1 fragment retrotranslocates to the cytosol to cause disease. Clustering of GM(1) by multivalent toxin binding can structurally remodel cell membranes in ways that may assist toxin uptake and retrograde trafficking. We have recently found, however, that <re> CT <er> may traffic from the PM to the ER by exploiting an endogenous glycosphingolipid pathway (A. A. Wolf et al., Infect. Immun. 76:1476-1484, 2008, and D. J. F. Chinnapen et al., Dev. Cell 23:573-586, 2012), suggesting that multivalent binding to GM(1) is dispensable. Here we formally tested this idea by creating homogenous chimeric holotoxins with defined numbers of native GM(1) binding sites from zero (nonbinding) to five (wild type). We found that a single GM(1) binding site is sufficient for activity of the holotoxin. Therefore, remodeling of cell membranes by mechanisms that involve multivalent binding of toxin to GM(1) receptors is not essential for toxicity of <re> CT <er>. Through multivalent binding to its lipid receptor, cholera toxin (<re> CT <er>) can remodel cell membranes in ways that may assist host cell invasion. We recently found that <re> CT <er> variants which bind no more than 2 receptor molecules do exhibit toxicity, suggesting that <re> CT <er> may be able to enter cells by coopting an endogenous lipid sorting pathway without clustering receptors. We tested this idea directly by using purified variants of <re> CT <er> with zero to five functional receptor-binding sites (<el> BS <le>). 
AZD8055 is an ATP-competitive inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) that forms two multiprotein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, and negatively regulates <re> autophagy <er>. We demonstrate that AZD8055 stimulates and potentiates chemotherapy-mediated <re> autophagy <er>, as shown by LC3I-II conversion and down-regulation of the ubiquitin-binding protein p62/sequestosome 1. AZD8055-induced <re> autophagy <er> was pro-survival as shown by its ability to attenuate cell death and DNA damage (p-H2AX), and to enhance clonogenic survival by cytotoxic chemotherapy. Autophagy inhibition by siRNA against Beclin 1 or LC3B, or by chloroquine, partially reversed the cytoprotective effect of AZD8055 that was independent of cell cycle inhibition. The pro-survival role of <re> autophagy <er> was confirmed using ectopic expression of Beclin 1 that conferred cytoprotection. To determine whether <re> autophagy <er>-mediated down-regulation of p62/sequestosome 1 contributes to its pro-survival role, we generated p62 knockdown cells using shRNA that showed protection from chemotherapy-induced cell death and DNA damage. We also overexpressed wild-type (wt) p62 that promoted chemotherapy-induced cell death, whereas mutated p62 at functional domains (PB1, UBA) failed to do so. The ability of ectopic wt p62 to promote cell death was blocked by AZD8055. AZD8055 was shown to inhibit phosphorylation of the <re> autophagy <er>-initiating kinase <el> ULK1 <le> at Ser(757) and inhibited known targets of mTORC1 (p-mTOR Ser(2448), p70S6K, p-S6, p4EBP1) and mTORC2 (p-mTOR Ser(2481), p-AKT Ser(473)). Knockdown of mTOR, but not Raptor or Rictor, reduced p-<el> ULK1 <le> at Ser(757) and enhanced chemotherapy-induced <re> autophagy <er> that resulted in a similar cytoprotective effect as shown for AZD8055. 
The propyl derivative of ajmaline, N-n-propylajamaline (<el> prajmalium <le>), is an antiarrhythmic compound that lacks the commonly reported negative inotropic effects of all others under clinical use. The present study was undertaken to establish and understand its effects at the cellular level in mammalian preparations. Electrical and mechanical activities were recorded from right ventricular strips and Na and L-type Ca currents (INa and <re> ICaL <er>, respectively) were recorded with the whole-cell patch-clamp technique in right ventricular myocytes freshly dissociated from rabbit hearts. Prajmalium decreased the maximal rate of depolarization of the action potential in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 3 microM. This effect was use and frequency dependent. Action potential duration was increased by 1 microM prajamalium but decreased on applying higher concentrations. The force of contraction was slightly (15%) increased at 0.1 microM, not affected at all at 1 microM and depressed by 30% at 20 microM. In single cardiomyocytes maintained at negative holding potentials, INa was slightly depressed by <el> prajmalium <le> at 10 nM and reduced by 75% at 10 microM. <re> ICaL <er> was increased by 30 and 20% on applying <el> prajmalium <le> at 1 and 10 microM, respectively; on the other hand, <re> ICaL <er> was reduced by these two concentrations of <el> prajmalium <le> at less negative holding potentials. A higher <el> prajmalium <le> concentration (100 microM) decreased <re> ICaL <er> at all holding potentials studies and this effect was enhanced with depolarization. The increase in <re> ICaL <er> induced by <el> prajmalium <le> (1 microM) was also observed after <re> ICaL <er> had been fully beta-adrenergic and P2-purinergic stimulated by isoproterenol (1 microM) in the presence of IBMX (100 microM) and ATP (10 microM). 
This study was performed to examine the effects of somatostatin on antral <re> gastrin release <er> stimulated by postreceptor increases in <el> adenosine <le> cyclic nucleotide. Increases in intracellular levels of cyclic <el> adenosine <le> monophosphate were achieved through the use of the dibutyryl derivative of cyclic <el> adenosine <le> monophosphate and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor theophylline. The effects of somatostatin on basal and stimulated <re> gastrin release <er> were examined in rat antral organ culture experiments. Inclusion of somatostatin in the culture medium (1 X 10(-8) to 1 X 10(-4) M) resulted in significant inhibition of <re> gastrin release <er> at somatostatin concentrations of 1 X 10(-5) and 1 X 10(-4) M: both doses of somatostatin inhibited <re> gastrin release <er> by approximately 52% at 30 min and by 32% at 6 h. Gastrin release stimulated by dibutyryl cyclic <el> adenosine <le> monophosphate was significantly inhibited by 1 X 10(-5) and 1 X 10(-4) M somatostatin to 133% and 121% at 30 min and 77% and 98% at 6 h, respectively. Gastrin release stimulated by theophylline (1 mM) was also significantly inhibited by somatostatin in doses ranging from 1 X 10(-6) to 1 X 10(-4) M. The degree of inhibition by somatostatin of dibutyryl cyclic <el> adenosine <le> monophosphate- and theophylline-stimulated <re> gastrin release <er> declined over the duration of culture. 
The effect of <el> nicardipine <le> on <re> insulin secretion <er> was examined in two double-blind, randomised, cross-over, placebo-controlled studies in normal volunteers. In the first study, the effect of acute dosing (via an intravenous infusion of 5 mg h-1 for 3 h) on the glucose, insulin, hormonal, and intermediary metabolite responses to an intravenous glucose tolerance test was determined in six healthy male volunteers. In the second study, the glucose, insulin, and C-peptide responses to intravenous tolbutamide (200 mg) was determined in another six male volunteers after oral dosing with <el> nicardipine <le> 30 mg three times daily for 1 week. A relative increase in <re> insulin secretion <er> was the principal finding of the first study. No other response was affected significantly. No significant differences between the <el> nicardipine <le>- and placebo-treated groups were noted in the insulin, glucose, and C-peptide measurements of the second study. 
Physical training decreases <el> glucose <le>-stimulated <re> insulin <er> secretion. To further explore the influence of the level of daily physical activity on beta-cell secretion, the effect of 7 days of bed rest was studied in six young, healthy men by sequential hyperglycemic clamp technique (7, 11, and 20 mM <el> glucose <le>, each step lasting 90 min). At 11 and 20 mM <el> glucose <le>, <re> insulin <er> concentrations in plasma were higher after (87 +/- 11 and 303 +/- 63 microU/ml) than before (63 +/- 5 and 251 +/- 50 microU/ml, P less than 0.05) bed rest. Also C-peptide levels were higher after bed rest than before during <el> glucose <le> stimulation. The responses of other hormones, metabolites, or electrolytes influencing beta-cell secretion were not influenced by bed rest. In spite of increased <re> insulin <er> levels after bed rest, <el> glucose <le> disposal at 20 mM of <el> glucose <le> was significantly lower after bed rest than before. 
The vasodilator activity of calcium entry blockers which is generally assumed to underlie their antihypertensive potency is probably located at the level of both potential- and receptor-operated channels in the sarcolemma. Although potential-operated channels probably play a major role, more and more evidence is accumulating to suggest that receptor-operated channels make a significant contribution. The receptors which, upon stimulation, trigger the influx of extracellular calcium ions are alpha-adrenoceptors of both subtypes (alpha 1/alpha 2), although the role of alpha 2-adrenoceptors can be understood more readily than that of the alpha 1-subtype. More recent evidence indicates that vascular angiotensin (ANG) II receptors, when stimulated, also cause an influx of extracellular calcium, which is required for the initiation of vasoconstriction. Conversely, all calcium entry blockers so far developed dose-dependently inhibit the calcium influx triggered by the stimulation of either alpha-adrenoceptors or <el> <re> ANG II <er> receptors <le>. Vascular tone is maintained to a substantial degree by the stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors (both alpha 1 and alpha 2) by circulating and neuronally released catecholamines, and probably also by <re> ANG II <er> in the vascular wall. It is therefore very likely that calcium entry blockers owe an important part of their vasodilator activity to the inhibition of the influence of alpha-adrenoceptor agonists and <re> ANG II <er> via the mechanisms discussed above. 
Although angiogenesis is viewed as a fundamental component of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathogenesis, we presently lack a thorough knowledge of the cell type(s) involved in its induction and maintenance in the inflamed intestinal mucosa. This study aimed to determine whether platelet (PLT) <re> adhesion <er> to inflamed intestinal endothelial cells of human origin may favour angiogenesis. Unstimulated or thrombin-activated human PLT were overlaid on resting or tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α-treated human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (HIMEC), in the presence or absence of blocking antibodies to either vascular cell <re> adhesion <er> molecule (VCAM)-1, intercellular <re> adhesion <er> molecule (ICAM)-1, integrin α(v)β(3) , tissue factor (TF) or fractalkine (<el> FKN <le>). PLT <re> adhesion <er> to HIMEC was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy, and release of angiogenic factors (VEGF and soluble CD40L) was measured by ELISA. A matrigel tubule formation assay was used to estimate PLT capacity to induce angiogenesis after co-culturing with HIMEC. TNF-α up-regulated ICAM-1, α(v)β(3) and <el> FKN <le> expression on HIMEC. When thrombin-activated PLT were co-cultured with unstimulated HIMEC, PLT <re> adhesion <er> increased significantly, and this response was further enhanced by HIMEC activation with TNF-α. PLT <re> adhesion <er> to HIMEC was VCAM-1 and TF independent but ICAM-1, <el> FKN <le> and integrin α(v)β(3) dependent. VEGF and sCD40L were undetectable in HIMEC cultures either before or after TNF-α stimulation. By contrast, VEGF and sCD40L release significantly increased when resting or activated PLT were co-cultured with TNF-α-pre-treated HIMEC. These effects were much more pronounced when PLT were derived from IBD patients. Importantly, thrombin-activated PLT promoted tubule formation in HIMEC, a functional estimate of their angiogenic potential. 
Neurotrophic factors possess an emerging role in the pathophysiology of several gastrointestinal disorders, regulating innervation, pain sensation and disease-associated neuroplasticity. Here, we aimed at characterizing the role of the neurotrophic factor neurturin (NRTN) and its receptor glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor alpha-2 (<el> GFR <le>α-2) in pancreatic cancer (<re> PCa <er>) and pancreatic neuropathy. For this purpose, NRTN and <el> GFR <le>α-2 were studied in normal human pancreas and <re> PCa <er> tissues via immunohistochemistry, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting and correlated to abdominal pain. The impact of NRTN/<el> GFR <le>α-2 on <re> PCa <er> cell (PCC) biology was investigated via exposure to hypoxia, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide viability and matrigel invasion assays in native and specific small interfering RNA-silenced PCCs. To assess the influence of NRTN on pancreatic neuroplasticity and neural invasion (NI), its impact was explored via an in vitro 'neuroplasticity assay' and a 3D neural migration assay. NRTN and <el> GFR <le>α-2 demonstrated a site-specific upregulation in <re> PCa <er>, predominantly in nerves, PCCs and extracellular matrix. Patients with severe pain demonstrated higher intraneural <el> GFR <le>α-2 immunoreactivity than patients with no pain. <re> PCa <er> tissue and PCCs contained increased amounts of NRTN, which was suppressed under hypoxia. NRTN promoted PCC invasiveness, and silencing of NRTN limited both PCC proliferation and invasion. Depletion of NRTN from <re> PCa <er> tissue extracts and PCC supernatants decreased axonal sprouting in neuronal cultures but did not influence glial density. Silencing of NRTN in PCCs boosted NI. 
Mutations of the photoreceptor retinol dehydrogenase 12 (<el> RDH12 <le>) gene cause the early onset retinal dystrophy Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) by mechanisms not completely resolved. Determining the physiological role of <el> RDH12 <le> in photoreceptors is the focus of this study. Previous studies showed that <el> RDH12 <le>, and the closely related retinol dehydrogenase RDH11, can enzymatically reduce toxic lipid peroxidation products such as 4-hydroxynonenal (<re> 4-HNE <er>), in vitro. To explore the significance of this activity, we investigated the ability of RDH11 and <el> RDH12 <le> to protect stably transfected HEK-293 cells against the toxicity of <re> 4-HNE <er>. Both enzymes protected against <re> 4-HNE <er> modification of proteins and <re> 4-HNE <er>-induced apoptosis in HEK-293 cells. In the retina, exposure to bright light induced lipid peroxidation, <re> 4-HNE <er> production, and <re> 4-HNE <er> modification of proteins in photoreceptor inner segments, where RDH11 and <el> RDH12 <le> are located. In mouse retina, <el> RDH12 <le>-but not RDH11-protected against adduct formation, suggesting that <re> 4-HNE <er> is a physiological substrate of <el> RDH12 <le>. <el> RDH12 <le>-but not RDH11-also protected against light-induced apoptosis of photoreceptors. 
Resveratrol has been reported to inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and neointimal hyperplasia following arterial injury; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of resveratrol on angiotensin II (<el> AngII <le>)‑induced proliferation of A7r5 cells and explore the molecular mechanisms responsible for the observed effects. Resveratrol inhibited cell proliferation and migration, and decreased the <el> AngII <le>‑induced protein expression of α‑smooth muscle actin (α‑SMA), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and cyclin‑dependent kinase 4 (CDK4). Resveratrol inhibited <el> AngII <le>‑induced activation of intracellular Ca2+/calmodulin‑dependent protein kinase II (<re> CaMKII <er>) and histone deacetylases 4 (HDAC4), as well as blocking <el> AngII <le>‑induced cell cycle progression from the G0/G1 to S‑phase. In vivo, 4‑weeks of resveratrol treatment decreased the neointima area and the neointima/media area ratio in rats following carotid balloon injury. Resveratrol also inhibited the protein expression of total and phosphorylated <re> CaMKII <er> and HDAC4 in the injured arteries. 
The hormone <el> leptin <le> has widespread actions in the CNS. Indeed, <el> leptin <le> markedly influences hippocampal excitatory synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. However, the effects of <el> leptin <le> on fast inhibitory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus have not been evaluated. Here, we show that <el> leptin <le> modulates <re> GABA <er>(A) receptor-mediated synaptic transmission onto hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. Leptin promotes a rapid and reversible increase in the amplitude of evoked <re> GABA <er>(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory synaptic currents (IPSCs); an effect that was paralleled by increases in the frequency and amplitude of miniature IPSCs, but with no change in paired pulse ratio or coefficient of variation, suggesting a post-synaptic expression mechanism. Following washout of <el> leptin <le>, a persistent depression (inhibitory long-lasting depression) of evoked IPSCs was observed. Whole-cell dialysis or bath application of inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase or Akt prevented <el> leptin <le>-induced enhancement of IPSCs indicating involvement of a post-synaptic PI 3-kinase/Akt-dependent pathway. In contrast, blockade of PI 3-kinase or Akt activity failed to alter the ability of <el> leptin <le> to induce inhibitory long-lasting depression, suggesting that this process is independent of PI 3-kinase/Akt. 
ER stress in type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) is common in idiopathic pulmonary <re> fibrosis <er> (IPF), but the contribution of ER stress to lung <re> fibrosis <er> is poorly understood. We found that mice deficient in C/EBP homologous protein (<el> CHOP <le>), an ER stress-regulated transcription factor, were protected from lung <re> fibrosis <er> and AEC apoptosis in 3 separate models where substantial ER stress was identified. In mice treated with repetitive intratracheal bleomycin, we identified localized hypoxia in type II AECs as a potential mechanism explaining ER stress. To test the role of hypoxia in lung <re> fibrosis <er>, we treated mice with bleomycin, followed by exposure to 14% O2, which exacerbated ER stress and lung <re> fibrosis <er>. Under these experimental conditions, <el> CHOP <le>-/- mice, but not mice with epithelial HIF (HIF1/HIF2) deletion, were protected from AEC apoptosis and <re> fibrosis <er>. In vitro studies revealed that <el> CHOP <le> regulates hypoxia-induced apoptosis in AECs via the inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) and the PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) pathways. 
The <re> hypocalcemia <er> effect of <el> gastrin <le> and the possible role of the hormone in calcium homeostasis have been demonstrated in our previous study. The mechanism involves neither the gastrointestinal absorption nor the removal of calcium from plasma but is possibly due to the suppression of the calcium influx into blood. In searching for the organ(s) involved in the action of <el> gastrin <le>, the following were tested and not found to be directly responsible: stomach, intestine, pancreas, liver, spleen, adrenal gland, kidney, lung, muscle, and red blood cell. After 17 hr of 45Ca administration, the turnover of 45Ca in the tibia was measured. Gastrin was found to suppress the release of 45Ca by 25% within 1 hr. The suppressive effect of <el> gastrin <le> on 45Ca release was also demonstrated in an in vitro preparation which showed that the 45Ca released from prelabeled tibia into the incubating medium was also reduced by <el> gastrin <le>. 
Signaling pathways involved in the development of osteoprogenitors induced by Wnts remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of MAPKs in the development of mesenchymal cells into osteoprogenitors. In C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal cells, <el> Wnt3a <le> induced a rapid and transient activation of MAPKs p38 and <re> ERK <er>. Dickkopf 1, a selective antagonist of Wnt proteins binding to low-density lipoprotein-receptor-related protein-5/6 did not influence activation of p38 and <re> ERK <er> induced by <el> Wnt3a <le>. A MAPK kinase-1/2 (MEK1/2) inhibitor blocked, whereas a p38 inhibitor had no effect on, <el> Wnt3a <le>-induced cell proliferation. In contrast, both inhibitors significantly reduced alkaline phosphatase stimulation with a more pronounced effect of the p38 inhibitor. The p38 inhibitor also blunted nodule mineralization induced by <el> Wnt3a <le>. Associated with these effects, beta-catenin transcriptional activity, assessed with the TOPflash system, was dose-dependently decreased by the p38 but not by the <re> ERK <er> inhibitor. Both the reduced alkaline phosphatase stimulation and blunting of beta-catenin transcriptional activity were mimicked by expression of dominant-negative (dn) p38 and dnMEK 3/6. Inhibition of beta-catenin transcriptional activity by the p38 inhibitor as well as by dnp38 and dnMEK 3/6 molecules were not associated with changes in cytosolic and nuclear beta-catenin levels induced by <el> Wnt3a <le>. 
Insulin sensitivity, <el> glucose <le> effectiveness, and endogenous <el> glucose <le> production (<re> EGP <er>) during stable-labeled, frequently sampled insulin-modified intravenous <el> glucose <le> tolerance test (FSIGT) were evaluated by a single-and two-compartment minimal model combined with nonparametric deconvolution in eleven nonobese Japanese type 2 diabetic patients. Four patients were treated with sulfonylureas, and the remaining seven with diet therapy alone. None had diabetic retinopathy and microalbuminuria. Their fasting <el> glucose <le> level was 117+/-7 mg/dl (mean +/- SE), and HbA1c was 6.6+/-0.3%. Age-, sex-, and BMI-matched subjects with normal <el> glucose <le> tolerance served as control subjects. Plasma insulin response to the stimuli and insulin sensitivity indexes (S(I), S(I)*, and S(I)2* were derived from a minimal model and single- and two-compartment-labeled minimal models) were impaired in the type 2 diabetic patients. The combined ability of <el> glucose <le>, per se, to increase its own uptake and suppress <re> EGP <er> (<el> glucose <le> effectiveness [SG]), which was derived from kinetic analysis of plasma <el> glucose <le> by a minimal model, was significantly lower in the type 2 diabetic patients (0.0132+/-0.0015 vs. 0.0203+/-0.0022; P<0.05). However, the ability of <el> glucose <le>, per se, to stimulate <el> glucose <le> uptake, assessed as S(G)* and S(G)2* from the kinetic analysis of labeled <el> glucose <le> by single- and two-compartment minimal model, was not impaired in those patients. <re> EGP <er> of the type 2 diabetic patients as a whole was suppressed to the level similar to that of the control subjects despite a higher plasma <el> glucose <le> level throughout FSIGT. When <re> EGP <er> in the diabetic subjects was analyzed, considering their recent glycemic control, the initial suppression was blunted in the patients with higher HbA1c levels. 
GABAB receptors are a subclass of receptors for gamma-amino-n-butyric acid (GABA) that are also activated by the antispastic drug beta-p-chlorophenyl-GABA (baclofen). One effect of baclofen is to inhibit excitatory transmission from CA3 to CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells. To identify the ionic mechanism of <el> GABAB-receptor <le>-mediated depression, we have studied the effect of baclofen and GABA on ionic currents in voltage-clamped CA3 pyramidal cell somata in rat hippocampal slice cultures. Baclofen (10 microM) induced an inwardly rectifying outward current that reversed at -74 +/- 4.3 mV (mean +/- SD). This appeared to be a <re> K+ <er> current since (i) its reversal potential showed the expected shift when extracellular <re> K+ <er> concentration was changed and (ii) it was blocked by external Ba2+ or internal Cs+. The action of baclofen was closely imitated by GABA after the GABAA-mediated Cl- current had been abolished with pitrazepin (10 microM); under these conditions, GABA (100 microM) also produced an inwardly rectifying, Ba2+-sensitive current with a reversal potential identical to that of the baclofen-induced current. When outward currents were blocked with internal Cs+, the residual inward voltage-dependent Ca2+ current was not changed by baclofen. 
Mild <re> insulin <er> resistance appears to be an early metabolic defect in girls with Turner syndrome (TS). Impaired glucose tolerance has been reported in 10-34% of patients with TS, and type 2 diabetes mellitus is 2-4 times more common and occurs at a younger age in girls with TS than in the general population. In a mixed longitudinal and cross-sectional study, we analysed carbohydrate tolerance and <re> insulin <er> sensitivity in 46 children and adolescents with TS who reached their final height after long-term treatment (mean 6.3 +/- 2.5 years) with growth hormone (<el> GH <le>: 0.33 mg/kg/week [0.05 mg/kg/day]), and in 36 of these patients who were followed-up after the cessation of <el> GH <le> therapy (mean follow-up, 2.6 +/- 2.5 years; range, 1-9.5 years). Patients with TS were compared with an age-matched female control group. Insulin sensitivity appeared to be lower in patients with TS than in controls, even before the start of <el> GH <le> therapy. As in controls, <re> insulin <er> sensitivity decreased with age in patients with TS, and levels were lower in those aged >12 years than in those aged <12 years. <el> GH <le> therapy resulted in good catch-up growth in patients with TS, with final height significantly higher than projected height evaluated before the initiation of <el> GH <le> therapy. Insulin sensitivity increased after 7-8 years of therapy and, on the cessation of <el> GH <le> therapy, returned to pre-treatment levels. The increase in <re> insulin <er> sensitivity seen on the cessation of <el> GH <le> therapy appeared to be influenced negatively by body mass index and triglyceride levels, and correlated positively with the number of years since cessation of <el> GH <le> therapy. As in the general population, excess weight and an abnormal lipid profile, in particular excess triglyceride levels, worsened <re> insulin <er> sensitivity. 
It has been shown that angiotensin II (<el> Ang II <le>) is involved in cardiac remodeling mediated by NADPH oxidase-dependent reactive oxygen species (<re> ROS <er>). Accordingly, NADPH oxidase-dependent <re> ROS <er> may play a role in cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload. In the present study, we sought to determine whether inhibition of NADPH oxidase prevents cardiac hypertrophy. After abdominal aorta banding to induce cardiac hypertrophy, rats were treated for 8 weeks with apocynin (Apo) or captopril (Cap). Measures of cardiac hypertrophy were evaluated. Treatment with Cap or Apo reduced the left ventricle/body weight ratio (LV/BW), LV transnuclear myocyte diameter, and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) mRNA expression relative to those of untreated rats subjected to aorta banding. The activity of NADPH oxidase and the <re> ROS <er> levels were decreased in treated animals. Cap, but not Apo, decreased <el> Ang II <le> levels and inhibited expression of p22phox and p67phox in LVs. 
Autophagy is involved in both innate and adaptive immune regulation. We propose that autophagy regulates activation of TLR3 in macrophages and is thereby essential for development of <el> pristane <le>-induced <re> arthritis <er>. We found that <el> pristane <le> treatment induced autophagy in macrophages in vitro and in vivo, in spleen cells from <el> pristane <le> injected rats. The induced autophagy was associated with STAT1 phosphorylation and expression of IRF1 and TLR3. Blocking the <el> pristane <le> activated autophagy by Wortmannin and Bafilomycin A1 or by RNAi of Becn1 led to a downregulation of the associated STAT1-IRF1-TLR3 pathway. Most importantly, the development of <re> arthritis <er> was alleviated by suppressing either autophagy or TLR3. 
Significant depression of mucociliary function occurs during general anesthesia. One possible mechanism to account for this effect is a change in ion and <re> water transport <er> across airway epithelium. To determine if anesthetics alter epithelial cell function, we used electrophysiologic techniques to measure the effects of <el> halothane <le> on ion transport of in vitro canine tracheal epithelial. Epithelial tissues were mounted in an Ussing chamber and the short-circuit current (Isc) (a measure of active ion transport) and transepithelial resistance were determined in the absence and presence of <el> halothane <le>. Halothane induced a rapid and reversible decrease in Isc that was dose-dependent. Four percent <el> halothane <le> reversibly decreased Isc from 90 +/- 11 to 39 +/- 6 microA/cm2 (n = 12; P = 0.001) and increased transepithelial resistance. Isoproterenol is a well-known activator of chloride secretion that acts via beta-adrenergic receptors and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Pretreatment with isoproterenol or dibutyryl cAMP (a cell permeable analogue of cAMP) increased the percent inhibition of Isc by 4% <el> halothane <le>. These effects are consistent with preferential inhibition of chloride secretion by <el> halothane <le> but rule out a primary action of <el> halothane <le> on the beta-adrenergic system. In the presence of indomethacin, which eliminates the contribution of chloride secretion to Isc, 4% <el> halothane <le> induced a much smaller but still significant inhibition. This suggests that sodium absorption is also affected. 
Abstract The ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the midbrain is important for food reward. High-fat containing palatable foods have reinforcing effects and accelerate <el> obesity <le>. We have previously reported that diet-induced <el> obesity <le> selectively decreased the spontaneous activity of VTA GABA neurons, but not <re> dopamine <er> neurons. The spontaneous activity of VTA <re> dopamine <er> neurons is regulated by D2 autoreceptors. In this study, we hypothesized that <el> obesity <le> would affect the excitability of VTA <re> dopamine <er> neurons via D2 autoreceptors. To examine this hypothesis, we compared D2 receptor-mediated responses of VTA <re> dopamine <er> neurons between lean and obese mice. Mice fed on a high-fat (45%) diet and mice fed on a standard diet were used as obese and lean models, respectively. Brain slice preparations were made from these two groups. Spontaneous activity of VTA neurons was recorded by extracellular recording. Putative VTA <re> dopamine <er> neurons were identified by firing inhibition with a D2 receptor agonist quinpirole, and electrophysiological criteria (firing frequency <5 Hz and action potential current duration >1.2 msec). Single-dose application of quinpirole (3-100 nmol/L) exhibited similar firing inhibition of putative VTA <re> dopamine <er> neurons between lean and obese mice. In stepwise application by increasing quinpirole concentrations of 3, 10, 30, and 100 nmol/L subsequently, quinpirole-induced inhibition of firing decreased in putative VTA <re> dopamine <er> neurons of obese mice compared with those of lean mice. 
Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 (<el> IL-1 <le>), and gamma-interferon (IF) are produced by activated hematopoietic cells. They possess antiviral activity and have other biological activities such as induction of cell proliferation and hemorrhagic necrosis of tumors. Since herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection of human vascular cells is known to produce a biochemical and cytopathological effect virtually indistinguishable from atherosclerosis, we hypothesized that these cytokines many prevent cholesteryl ester (CE) accumulation in arterial smooth muscle cells (SMC) that is seen with herpesvirus infection. We now report that TNF and <el> IL-1 <le> but not gamma-IF prevent CE accumulation in HSV-infected arterial SMC by induction of cyclic AMP-dependent CE hydrolysis. This effect is mediated through the arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase pathway via <re> 12-HETE <er> since pretreatment of cells with several lipoxygenase inhibitors abolishes the antiviral effect and <re> 12-HETE <er> is the major (greater than 99%) lipoxygenase metabolite produced by these cells. 
We aimed to study the relationship between glucosamine and FoxO1/Notch in gluconeogenesis and maintenance of mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) self-renewal. Glucosamine (GlcN) increased glucose production and gluconeogenic enzyme (G6Pase and PEPCK) expression. GlcN also increased the percentage of cells in S phase, number of cells, and the protein expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins that were blocked by 3-mercaptopicolinic acid (gluconeogenesis inhibitor) or glucose transporter (GLUT) 1 neutralizing antibody. GlcN increased the O-GlcNAc transferase (<el> OGT <le>)-dependent protein O-GlcNAc level. Moreover, inhibition of <el> OGT <le> (by ST045849) decreased glucose production. GlcN enhanced the expression of <el> OGT <le>-dependent O-GlcNAcylated <re> Notch1 <er> and then increased the translocation of cleaved <re> Notch1 <er> to the nucleus. Moreover, GlcN stimulated the translocation of O-GlcNAcylated FoxO1 to the nucleus. GlcN increased the binding between cleaved <re> Notch1 <er> and FoxO1 with CSL, a transcription factor, which was blocked by L-685,458 (γ-secretase inhibitor) or ST045849, respectively. Simultaneous blockage of cleaved <re> Notch1 <er> and FoxO1 also decreased the expression of G6Pase and PEPCK more significantly than that by inhibition of cleaved <re> Notch1 <er> alone or FoxO1 alone. In addition, GlcN maintained the undifferentiation status while depletion of <re> Notch1 <er> and FoxO1 for 3 days decreased Oct4 and SSEA-1 expression and alkaline phosphatase activity or increased the mRNA expression of GATA4, Tbx5, Cdx2, and Fgf5. 
Rapid electrical activation, as occurs during atrial fibrillation (AF), is known to cause reductions in atrial refractoriness and in adaptation to heart rate of the atrial refractory period, which promote the maintenance of AF, but the underlying ionic mechanisms are unknown. In order to determine the cellular and ionic changes caused by chronic atrial <el> tachycardia <le>, we studied right atrial myocytes from dogs subjected to 1, 7, or 42 days of atrial pacing at 400/min and compared them with myocytes from sham-operated dogs (pacemaker inserted but not activated). Rapid pacing led to progressive increases in the duration of AF induced by bursts of 10-Hz stimuli (from 3 +/- 2 seconds in sham-operated dogs to 3060 +/- 707 seconds in dogs after 42 days of pacing, P < .001) and reduced atrial refractoriness and adaptation to rate of the atrial refractory period. Voltage-clamp studies showed that chronic rapid pacing did not alter inward rectifier K+ current, rapid or slow components of the delayed rectifier current, the ultrarapid delayed rectifier current, T-type Ca2+ current, or Ca(2+)-dependent Cl- current. In contrast, the densities of transient outward current (Ito) and L-type Ca2+ current (<re> ICa <er>) were progressively reduced as the duration of rapid pacing increased, without concomitant changes in kinetics or voltage dependence. In keeping with in vivo changes in refractoriness, action potential duration (APD) and APD adaptation to rate were decreased by rapid pacing. The response of the action potential and ionic currents flowing during the action potential (as exposed by action-potential voltage clamp) to nifedipine in normal canine cells and in cells from rapidly paced dogs suggested that the APD changes in paced dogs were largely due to reductions in <re> ICa <er>. 
Aldosterone induces the expression of the small G protein <el> K-Ras <le>. Both <el> K-Ras <le> and its 1st effector phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (<re> PI3-K <er>) are necessary and sufficient for the activation of ENaC increasing channel open probability. The cell signaling mechanism by which <el> K-Ras <le> enhances ENaC activity, however, is uncertain. We demonstrate here that <el> K-Ras <le> significantly activates human ENaC reconstituted in Chinese hamster ovary cells approximately 3-fold. Activation in response to <el> K-Ras <le> was sensitive to the irreversible <re> PI3-K <er> inhibitor wortmannin but not the competitive LY294002 inhibitor of this phospholipid kinase. Similarly, a <re> PI3-K <er> 1st effector-specific Ras mutant (G12:C40) enhanced ENaC activity in a wortmannin but not LY294002 sensitive manner. Constitutively active <re> PI3-K <er> also enhanced ENaC activity but in a wortmannin and LY294002 sensitive manner with the effects of <re> PI3-K <er> and <el> K-Ras <le> not being additive. The activation of ENaC by <re> PI3-K <er> was also sensitive to intracellular GDPbetaS. Constitutively active <re> PI3-K <er> that is incapable of interacting with <el> K-Ras <le> (K227E p110alpha) acted as dominant negative with respect to the regulation of ENaC even in the presence of <el> K-Ras <le>. <el> K-Ras <le> is known to directly interact with <re> PI3-K <er> with aldosterone promoting this interaction. Here we demonstrate that <el> K-Ras <le> also interacts with ENaC through an, as yet, undetermined mechanism. 
It has been shown that <el> furosemide <le>, via nondiuretic vascular effects, reduces pulmonary shunt and lung water during the development of oleic acid permeability <re> edema <er>. We studied this effect in a fully established stable model of oleic acid permeability <re> edema <er>. Sixteen anesthetized mongrel dogs, mechanically ventilated with a FIO2 of 0.5, were studied 24 hr after induction of pulmonary capillary leak by intravenous oleic acid (0.06 cc/kg). After stabilization of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) in the range of 0.5-3 mm Hg, bilateral ureteral ligation was performed. Furosemide (2 mg/kg) was then administered intravenously to eight dogs (treated group). An equivalent volume of saline was given to eight control dogs (control group). Pulmonary artery (PAP) and capillary wedge pressures (PCWP), thermodilution cardiac output (Qt), thermal dye lung water (LW), venous admixture (Qva/Qt), arterial and mixed venous blood gases (PaO2, MVO2) were then measured at hourly intervals for 4 hr. During this period of time, central hemodynamics (PCWP, PAP, Qt) remained stable in both groups. Indices of gas exchange and <re> edema <er> formation (Qva/Qt, LW, PaO2) did not change significantly in either control or treated animals. 
How <el> progesterone <le> blocks the E2-induced <re> GnRH <er> surge in females is not known. In this study we assessed whether the endogenous opioid peptides (EOPs) that mediate <el> progesterone <le> negative feedback on pulsatile <re> GnRH <er> secretion also mediate the blockade of the <re> GnRH <er> surge. We treated ovariectomized ewes with physiological levels of E2 and <el> progesterone <le> to stimulate and block the <re> GnRH <er> surge, respectively, using LH secretion as an index of <re> GnRH <er> release. A pilot study confirmed that blocking opioidergic neurotransmission with the opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone (NAL; 1 mg/kg.h, i.v.), could prevent the suppression of pulsatile LH secretion by <el> progesterone <le> in our model. By contrast, antagonizing EOP receptors with NAL did not restore LH surges in ewes in which the E2-induced <re> GnRH <er> surge was blocked by <el> progesterone <le> treatment during the E2-dependent activation stage (Exp 1) of the <re> GnRH <er> surge induction process. However, in ewes treated with <el> progesterone <le> during the E2-independent transmission stage (Exp 2), NAL partially restored blocked LH surges, as indicated by increased fluctuations in LH that, in some cases, resembled LH surges. 
Periodic breathing has been found in patients with heart failure and sleep apneas, and in healthy subjects in hypoxia, during sleep and wakefulness, at rest and, recently, at exercise. To unravel the cardiorespiratory parameters liable to modulate the amplitude and period of ventilatory oscillations, 26 healthy subjects were tested under physiological (exercise) and environmental (hypoxia, hyperoxia, hyperoxic <el> hypercapnia <le>) stresses, and under acetazolamide (ACZ) treatment. A fast Fourier transform spectral analysis of breath-by-breath ventilation (V˙E) evidenced an increase in V˙E peak power under <el> hypercapnia <le> (vs. normoxia and hyperoxia, P < 0.001) and a decrease under ACZ (vs. placebo, P < 0.001), whereas it was not modified in hyperoxia. V˙E period was shortened by exercise in all conditions (vs. rest, P < 0.01) and by <el> hypercapnia <le> (vs. normoxia, P < 0.05) but remained unchanged under ACZ (vs. placebo). V˙E peak power was positively related to cardiac output (<re> Q˙c <er>) and V˙E in hyperoxia (P < 0.01), in <el> hypercapnia <le> (P < 0.001) and under ACZ (P < 0.001). V˙E period was negatively related to <re> Q˙c <er> and V˙E in hyperoxia (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively), in <el> hypercapnia <le> (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively) and under ACZ (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). Total respiratory cycle time was the main factor responsible for changes in V˙E period. 
Benzyl isothiocyanate (<el> BITC <le>), a dietary cancer chemopreventive agent, causes <re> apoptosis <er> in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, but the mechanism of cell death is not fully understood. We now demonstrate that the <el> BITC <le>-induced <re> apoptosis <er> in human breast cancer cells is initiated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to inhibition of complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The <el> BITC <le>-induced ROS production and <re> apoptosis <er> were significantly inhibited by overexpression of catalase and Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase and pharmacological inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The mitochondrial DNA-deficient Rho-0 variant of MDA-MB-231 cells was nearly completely resistant to <el> BITC <le>-mediated ROS generation and <re> apoptosis <er>. The Rho-0 MDA-MB-231 cells also resisted <el> BITC <le>-mediated mitochondrial translocation (activation) of Bax. Biochemical assays revealed inhibition of complex III activity in <el> BITC <le>-treated MDA-MB-231 cells as early as at 1 h of treatment. The <el> BITC <le> treatment caused activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which function upstream of Bax activation in apoptotic response to various stimuli. Pharmacological inhibition of both JNK and p38 MAPK conferred partial yet significant protection against <el> BITC <le>-induced <re> apoptosis <er>. Activation of JNK and p38 MAPK resulting from <el> BITC <le> exposure was abolished by overexpression of catalase. The <el> BITC <le>-mediated conformational change of Bax was markedly suppressed by ectopic expression of catalytically inactive mutant of JNK kinase 2 (JNKK2(AA)). Interestingly, a normal human mammary epithelial cell line was resistant to <el> BITC <le>-mediated ROS generation, JNK/p38 MAPK activation, and <re> apoptosis <er>. 
Mycophenolic acid (<el> MPA <le>), widely used to prevent organ transplant rejection, may induce toxicity and impair function in beta-cells. Mechanisms of <el> MPA <le>-induced <re> cell death <er> have not been fully explored. In this study, we examined gene expression patterns in INS-1E cells and isolated primary rat islets following <el> MPA <le> treatment using the Illumina-cDNA microarray. The <el> MPA <le> treatment decreases RhoGDI-alpha gene expression, which points to apoptosis by JNK activation through a MAPKs-dependent pathway. A strong association between RhoGDI-alpha and Rac1 activation during <el> MPA <le>-induced apoptosis is also consistent with apoptosis through JNK. Suppression of RhoGDI-alpha using siRNA and gene over-expression both affected the <re> cell death <er> rate, consistent with Rac1 activation and downstream activation of MAPKs signaling. We confirmed that Rac1 protein mediates the interaction between RhoGDI-alpha and JNK signaling. 
Taxifolin has been reported to down-regulate the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), a receptor-mediating firm adhesion with beta2 integrin (e.g., Mac-1) expressed on leukocytes. To evaluate whether taxifolin could modulate Mac-1-dependent firm adhesion by neutrophils, and the possible mechanism(s) underlying its anti-inflammatory action, its effects on N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-activated peripheral human neutrophils were studied. Pretreatment with taxifolin (1-100 microM) concentration-dependently diminished fMLP- or (PMA)-induced Mac-1-dependent firm adhesion and upexpression of surface Mac-1. Mobilisation of intracellular <re> calcium <er> and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) signal the upexpression of Mac-1 and firm adhesion by neutrophils. Taxifolin impeded the <re> calcium <er> influx induced by fMLP (a receptor-mediated activator) or AlF(4)(-) (a <el> G protein <le>-mediated activator). Taxifolin also effectively inhibited the fMLP- or PMA-induced ROS production with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) less than 10microM, possibly through impairing the activation of NADPH oxidase, a major ROS-generating enzyme in neutrophils, by restricting the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and protein kinase C (PKC). 
This investigation was undertaken to determine whether a Starling resistor or venous waterfall effect exists between the sagittal sinus and the cerebral veins such that increases in sagittal sinus pressure (<re> Pss <er>) do not abolish cerebral venous outflow and to examine two possible contributions of extracranial venous valves in regulating outflow. Anesthetized dogs were subjected to positive end-expiratory pressure (<el> PEEP <le>) before and after intracranial pressure (Pic) was elevated by inflation of an epidural balloon. <el> PEEP <le> raised <re> Pss <er> equally in all animals, but Pic and cerebral venous pressure (Pcv) increased less in the presence of intracranial hypertension. When <re> Pss <er> was low, passage of a catheter in the cerebral vein in and out of the sagittal sinus demonstrated an abrupt drop in pressure as the sinus was entered. When <re> Pss <er> was raised and lowered independently of superior vena caval pressure (Psvc) the changes in Pic and Pcv were less when <re> Pss <er> was decreased than when it was increased. Sustained increases and decreases in Psvc caused increases and decreases in Pcv, Pic, <re> Pss <er>, and external jugular venous pressure (Pejv) regardless of whether external jugular venous valves were present or absent. 
A reduced <re> nephron <er> complement at birth renders the kidney susceptible to renal disease in adulthood. Retinoic acid (RA; the active metabolite of vitamin A) is linked to nephrogenesis in vitro and in vivo. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of administration of <el> retinoic acid <le> in midgestation in rats on <re> nephron <er> endowment in offspring exposed to maternal protein restriction. Rats were fed either a normal-protein diet (NPD) or a low-protein diet (LPD) during pregnancy and lactation. Half of the dams in the LPD group were injected intraperitoneally with <el> retinoic acid <le> (20 mg/kg) during gestation at embryonic day 11.5. At 4 weeks of age, the offspring were anesthetized and perfusion-fixed, and <re> nephron <er> number estimated using unbiased stereological techniques. Body weight and kidney volume was significantly reduced in all LPD offspring. There was a significant 29% reduction in <re> nephron <er> number in the LPD group compared with the NPD offspring, whereas the number of <re> nephron <er>s in kidneys from the LPD + RA offspring was not significantly different compared with controls. 
We hypothesized that a redox-sensitive transcription factor, redox factor-1 (<el> Ref-1 <le>) (HAP1, APE, and APEX), was critical in the regulation of endothelial cell survival in <re> response to hypoxia <er> and cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Hypoxia resulted in a significant decrease in <el> Ref-1 <le> protein expression in both human umbilical vein endothelial cells and calf pulmonary artery endothelial cells. The hypoxia-induced decrease in <el> Ref-1 <le> expression was followed by a significant induction of apoptosis as measured by caspase 3 activity and nuclear morphology. Transient upregulation of <el> Ref-1 <le> significantly inhibited hypoxia-induced apoptosis. However, deletion of the redox-sensitive domain of <el> Ref-1 <le> abolished the antiapoptotic effect. We postulated that the antiapoptotic effects of <el> Ref-1 <le> were mediated through nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). However, blockade of NF-kappaB with a dominant-negative IkappaB (S32A/S36A) expression vector had no effect on <el> Ref-1 <le>-mediated survival under hypoxic conditions. The second aim of this study was to test the cytoprotective ability of <el> Ref-1 <le> upregulation in response to TNF-induced apoptosis. <el> Ref-1 <le> inhibition of TNF-induced death was associated with a significant potentiation of NF-kappaB activity. Deletion of the redox-sensitive domain of <el> Ref-1 <le> significantly inhibited TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation. Moreover, loss of the redox-sensitive domain also abolished the antiapoptotic effect of <el> Ref-1 <le> in response to TNF. To test whether <el> Ref-1 <le> induced activation of NF-kappaB was necessary to promote survival, we blocked NF-kappaB activity with a dominant-negative IkappaB (S32A/S36A). Indeed, blockade of NF-kappaB activity abolished the ability of <el> Ref-1 <le> to rescue TNF-induced apoptosis. 
We studied a 58-year-old woman during an acute episode of cardiac <re> pulmonary edema <er> complicated by carbon dioxide (<el> CO2 <le>) retention. As pulmonary wedge pressure became greater, metabolic production of <el> CO2 <le> increased by 38 ml/min and minute ventilation by 1.53 L; by contrast, alveolar ventilation remained unchanged due to a concomitant rise in physiologic dead space and, as a result, arterial <el> CO2 <le> tension increased up to 61 mm Hg. With treatment, all these variables returned to baseline values. Subsequent measurement of mouth occlusion pressure (p 0.1) during a <el> CO2 <le> rebreathing trial showed that neuromuscular inspiratory drive response to <el> CO2 <le> was preserved, but that ventilatory response was markedly reduced, presumably because of the severe restrictive and obstructive ventilatory defect and of the loss of inspiratory muscle force demonstrated in the patient. 
The effects of hypophysectomy on serum <el> testosterone <le>, 125I-labelled hCG binding to testicular membranes and on testicular responsiveness were studied in adult rats. Serum <el> testosterone <le> decreased rapidly over the first 6 h after hypophysectomy. <re> LH <er> receptors were determined (pmol/testis) by measuring the specific binding of 125I-labelled hCG in membrane preparations of testes of rats hypophysectomized 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, or 15 days earlier. Hypophysectomy did not result in a decrease in 125I-labelled hCG binding on day 1 but this had decreased to 40% of that in intact controls by day 2. A gradual decline was found between days 2 and 6 at which time hCG binding had decreased to 15%. No further decrease occurred between days 6 and 15. Scatchard analysis indicated that the decline in hCG binding was due to a decreaffinity. FSH, <el> testosterone <le>, dihydrotestosterone, and oestradiol were unable to prevent the decline in hCG binding. Although serum <el> testosterone <le>, testicular <el> testosterone <le> content, and 125I-labelled hCG binding decreased rapidly after hypophysectomy, testicular responsiveness to <re> LH <er> was biphasic. The intraperitoneal administration of 25 microgram <re> LH <er> 2 h before decapitation increased <el> testosterone <le> in the circulation to a greater extent extent in animals hypophysectomized for 1 day than in intact controls while hCG binding affinities and capacities had not changed. Two or three days after hypophysectomy testicular responsiveness to <re> LH <er> was similar to that of intact controls even though hCG binding in hypophysectomized animals had decreased to 40 and 28% of intact controls respectively. 
In the present study, we investigated the effect of feeding Partially hydrogenated vegetable fat (PHVF) on carrageenan induced paw <el> inflammation <le> and oxidative stress markers in liver of rats. In addition, the effect of feeding rats with Linseed Oil (<re> LSO <er>, α-linolenic acid, n-3 PUFA) or PHVF blended with incremental amounts of <re> LSO <er> on these markers were also monitored. Rats weighing 200 g were given 1 mL of different oils (PHVF, Groundnut Oil; GNO, Olive Oil; OO and <re> LSO <er>) per day for 15 days. Rats given PHVF showed higher levels of paw <el> inflammation <le> in response to carrageenan injection. Rats given <re> LSO <er> showed least amounts of paw <el> inflammation <le> when injected with carrageenan. A second set of experiment was conducted by feeding weaning rats with AIN-93 purified diet supplemented with PHVF or PHVF with incremental amounts of <re> LSO <er> for 60 days. The rats fed PHVF showed higher degree of carrageenan induced <el> inflammation <le> as compared to rats given GNO and <re> LSO <er>. However, the rats fed PHVF showed lower levels of lipid peroxides, protein carbonyls, 8-hydroxy guanine and antioxidant enzyme activities in liver homogenate as compared to those given <re> LSO <er>. 
Mandibular condylar cartilage acts as both articular and growth plate cartilage during growth, and then becomes articular cartilage after growth is complete. Cartilaginous extracellular matrix is remodeled continuously via a combination of production, degradation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and inhibition of MMP activity by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). This study attempted to clarify the age-related changes in the mRNA expression patterns of <re> MMP-2 <er>, MMP-9, <el> TIMP-1 <le>, TIMP-2, and TIMP-3 in mandibular condylar cartilage in comparison to tibial growth plate and articular cartilage using an in situ hybridization method in growing and adult rats. <re> MMP-2 <er> and MMP-9 were expressed in a wide range of condylar cartilage cells during growth, and their expression domains became limited to mature chondrocytes in adults. The patterns of <el> TIMP-1 <le> and TIMP-2 expression were similar to those of <re> MMP-2 <er> and MMP-9 during growth, and were maintained until adulthood. TIMP-3 was localized to hypertrophic chondrocytes throughout the growth stage. 
Human corpora lutea (CL) of the menstrual cycle and early pregnancy were excised at operation, cut into pieces, and incubated or superfused in the presence of hCG or prostaglandin (PG) E2. After incubation, the tissue levels of cAMP and the medium concentrations of progesterone (P) were determined, while the concentration of P was analyzed after superfusion. <el> PGE2 <le> stimulated <re> cAMP formation <er> in CL from all phases of the menstrual cycle as well as from early pregnancy and caused an increase in P formation in CL from the early and midluteal phases of the menstrual cycle as well as from early pregnancy. A difference was found in the latency, the lag phase until maximal response, and the duration of response between the effects of <el> PGE2 <le> and hCG on both cAMP and P formation. Thus, the effect of <el> PGE2 <le> started more rapidly and was of shorter duration than that of hCG. The stimulatory effect of <el> PGE2 <le> on CL from early pregnancy was of the same magnitude as that of CL from the menstrual cycle. On the other hand, hCG had less stimulatory effect on cAMP and P formation in CL from early pregnancy compared to CL from the menstrual cycle. 
Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) produced by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells are responsible for the growth of HCC cells. Accumulating evidence shows that insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) suppresses HCC cell proliferation in both IGF-dependent and independent manners. It's unknown, however, whether treatment with exogenous IGFBP-3 inhibits bFGF and PDGF production in HCC cells. The present study demonstrates that IGFBP-3 suppressed IGF-1-induced bFGF and PDGF expression while it does not affect their expression in the absence of IGF-1. To delineate the underlying mechanism, western-blot and RT-PCR assays confirmed that the transcription factor early growth response protein 1 (<el> EGR1 <le>) is involved in IGFBP-3 regulation of bFGF and PDGF. IGFBP-3 inhibition of type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R), <re> ERK <er> and AKT activation is IGF-1-dependent. Furthermore, transient transfection with constitutively activated AKT or MEK partially blocks the IGFBP-3 inhibition of <el> EGR1 <le>, bFGF and PDGF expression. 
The synthetic triterpenoid methyl-2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean-1,9-dien-28-oate (CDDO-Me) is in phase I clinical trials as a novel cancer therapeutic agent. We previously showed that CDDO-Me induces c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent death receptor 5 (<re> DR5 <er>) expression and augments death receptor-induced apoptosis. The current study focused on addressing how CDDO-Me induces JNK-dependent <re> DR5 <er> expression. Analysis of <re> DR5 <er> promoter regions defines that the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (<el> CHOP <le>) binding site is responsible for CDDO-Me-induced transactivation of the <re> DR5 <er> gene. Consistently, CDDO-Me induced <re> DR5 <er> expression and parallel <el> CHOP <le> up-regulation. Blockade of <el> CHOP <le> up-regulation also abrogated CDDO-Me-induced <re> DR5 <er> expression. These results indicate that CDDO-Me induces <el> CHOP <le>-dependent <re> DR5 <er> up-regulation. Moreover, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 abrogated <el> CHOP <le> induction by CDDO-Me, suggesting a JNK-dependent <el> CHOP <le> up-regulation by CDDO-Me as well. Importantly, knockdown of <el> CHOP <le> attenuated CDDO-Me-induced apoptosis, showing that <el> CHOP <le> induction is involved in CDDO-Me-induced apoptosis. Additionally, CDDO-Me increased the levels of Bip, phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha, inositol requiring kinase 1alpha, and activating transcription factor 4, all of which are featured changes during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Furthermore, salubrinal, an inhibitor of ER stress-induced apoptosis, inhibited JNK activation and up-regulation of <el> CHOP <le> and <re> DR5 <er> by CDDO-Me and protected cells from CDDO-Me-induced apoptosis. Thus, ER stress seems to be important for CDDO-Me-induced JNK activation, <el> CHOP <le> and <re> DR5 <er> up-regulation, and apoptosis. 
Divergent results regarding the immunosuppressive effects of mammalian-target-of-rapamycin-(mTOR)-inhibitors on venous endothelial cells (ECs) have highlighted the importance of an accurate EC-model. The purpose of this study was to determine mTOR-inhibitor effects at a specific site of action -- the human coronary-artery-ECs (HCAECs) -- and to compare these data with results gained from cultures of human saphenous vein ECs (HSVECs). This EC-model could enable us to gain insight into site-specific pharmacodynamics and the immunosuppressive management of transplant vasculopathy. ECs were cultivated with rising concentrations of mTOR-inhibitors in the presence/absence of tumor necrosis factor (<el> TNF <le>). Cell counts, DNA-synthesis, cytotoxicity and concentrations of the cytokine <re> IL-6 <er> as well as the chemokines IL-8 and MCP-1 were measured. Half-maximal inhibitory effects on cell growth were reached after about 30 h incubation and both cell types showed equal responses regarding cell growth and DNA-synthesis after 48 h incubation time. mTOR-inhibitors failed to suppress basal/<el> TNF <le>-induced secretion of IL-8 and MCP-1, but <re> IL-6 <er> synthesis after <el> TNF <le>-induction was reduced to 35%. In contrast to human saphenous vein ECs (HSVECs), mTOR-inhibitors also reduced basal <re> IL-6 <er>-secretion of HCAECs (to 55%) and cell proliferation was simultaneously inhibited within the same concentration range. 
High mobility group box 1 protein (<re> HMGB1 <er>), a nuclear non-histone DNA-binding protein, is secreted extracellularly during inflammation and is a late mediator of inflammatory responses. The pro-inflammatory activity of recombinant <re> HMGB1 <er> proteins is dependent upon the formation of complexes with other mediators, such as lipopolysaccharide (<el> LPS <le>). This study investigated the influence of heparin on <el> LPS <le>+<re> HMGB1 <er>-mediated inflammatory responses in cultured macrophages and a murine sepsis model. <re> HMGB1 <er> promoted the phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2. <re> HMGB1 <er> enhanced the induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, by <el> LPS <le> in macrophages. Heparin blocked the binding of <re> HMGB1 <er> to the surface of macrophages, and suppressed the phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2, but not JNK; TNF-α secretion was also decreased. However, heparin alone did not affect <el> LPS <le>-induced production of TNF-α. Heparin reduced lethality in mice exposed to <el> LPS <le>+<re> HMGB1 <er>. 
Mixed lineage kinases (MLKs) have been implicated in cytokine signaling as well as in cell death pathways. Our studies show that MLK3 is activated in leukocyte-infiltrated islets of non-obese diabetic mice and that MLK3 activation compromises mitochondrial integrity and induces apoptosis of beta cells. Using an ex vivo model of islet-splenocyte co-culture, we show that MLK3 mediates its effects via the pseudokinase <el> TRB3 <le>, a mammalian homolog of Drosophila Tribbles. <el> TRB3 <le> expression strongly coincided with conformational change and mitochondrial translocation of BAX. Mechanistically, MLK3 directly interacted with and stabilized <el> TRB3 <le>, resulting in inhibition of <re> Akt <er>, a strong suppressor of BAX translocation and mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Accordingly, attenuation of MLK3 or <el> TRB3 <le> expression each prevented cytokine-induced BAX conformational change and attenuated the progression to apoptosis. 
We measured the effects of seven consecutive daily infusions of <el> alpha-ketoisocaproate <le> (the alpha-keto analogue of leucine) or leucine itself on urinary urea and total <re> nitrogen <er> excretion during fasting. Two study protocols were undertaken. In protocol I, subjects underwent three separate 14-d fasts: one during which 34 mmol/d of leucine were infused on days 1--7; a second during which 34 mmol/d of <el> alpha-ketoisocaproate <le> were infused on days 1--7; and a third control fast during which no infusions were given. Infusions of <el> alpha-ketoisocaproate <le> significantly reduced daily urine urea <re> nitrogen <er> excretion compared with both the control fasts and the fasts in which leucine was infused (P less than 0.001). This <re> nitrogen <er>-sparing effect of <el> alpha-ketoisocaproate <le> persisted during days 8--14 even though no further infusions were given. Daily urinary urea <re> nitrogen <er> excretion during fasts when leucine was administered did not differ from values observed during control fasts. In protocol II, subjects were starved on two occasions for 14 d. During one fast, infusions of 11 mmol/d of <el> alpha-ketoisocaproate <le> were given on days 1--7; during the control fast, no infusions were given. Daily urine urea <re> nitrogen <er> excretion was lower (P less than 0.001) on days 1--7 and also on days 8--14 of the fast during which <el> alpha-ketoisocaproate <le> was given. The <re> nitrogen <er>-sparing effect of <el> alpha-ketoisocaproate <le> could not be related to changes in circulating levels of amino acids, ketone bodies, or insulin in either protocol. 
We investigated whether transfer of the gene encoding the angiogenesis inhibitor <el> endostatin <le> into the NIH/3T3 fibroblast cell line could inhibit renal <re> tumor <er> growth in vivo. NIH/3T3 cells were transduced with retroviral vectors containing the murine <el> endostatin <le> (ES) gene. SCID mice bearing CaKi-1 derived <re> tumor <er>s were given a subcutaneous injection of either ES-transduced cells or control cells and were monitored for <re> tumor <er> growth. At the end of the in vivo experiment, the mean <re> tumor <er> volume of treated mice was 51.6 +/- 2.4 mm3, while the <re> tumor <er> volume of control was 234.5 +/- 14.8 mm3. Microvascular density was significantly decreased on treatment (control 9.79 vs. ES 2.53%, <0.001) accompanied by a 23-fold increase in intratumoral necrotic area and a 2.94-fold increase in the apoptotic index, determined by immunohistochemistry with anti-activated caspase-3. Apoptotic cells were found in foci enriched in infiltrating leukocytes. 
The possible in vivo consequences of proteolytic activity found in <el> pancreatic pseudocyst <le> fluid was investigated experimentally using fresh vessels from rabbit and humans. Proteolytic pseudocyst fluid caused a pronounced and time-dependent decrease in breaking strength of fresh vessels. A destruction of the normal histological architecture and fragmentation of the elastic tissue of the vessel wall paralleled the mechanical findings. The proteolytic <re> digestion <er> was caused by the low-mol-wt fraction of the pseudocyst fluid, corresponding to free proteases. Part of this proteolysis was probably caused by pancreatic proteases, since pancreatic juice also caused a decrease in breaking strength and a destruction of the histologic architecture of the vessel wall. Proteases bound to protease inhibitors, i.e., to alpha-2-macroglobulin, had no proteolytic activity. 
We previously found that spinal clonidine prolongs labor analgesia when combined with spinal bupivacaine and sufentanil. We sought to determine whether the addition of spinal <el> neostigmine <le> to these drugs would further enhance labor analgesia. By use of a combined spinal/epidural technique, 36 patients were randomized to receive a hyperbaric spinal injection of bupivacaine 2.5 mg plus clonidine 50 microg and sufentanil 10 microg with or without <el> neostigmine <le> 10 microg. Pain, maternal hemodynamics, fetal heart rate, <re> nausea <er>, pruritus, sedation, motor block, sensory levels to pinprick, and maternal oxygen saturation were assessed at regularly specified intervals after spinal injection until additional analgesia was requested. The duration of spinal analgesia was similar between groups (215 +/- 60 min in the Control group versus 205 +/- 62 min in the Neostigmine group). Likewise, pain scores, the duration of labor, Apgar scores, and side effects were similar between groups except that patients administered <el> neostigmine <le> experienced significantly more <re> nausea <er> and vomiting (53% vs 7%, P = 0.01). 
Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are ubiquitous proteins that function in both normal and stress-related pathophysiological states of the cell. This study aimed to analyze the importance of p38MAPK in pancreatic injury using WBN/Kob rats with spontaneous chronic pancreatitis. Male WBN/Kob rats were injected with the p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580, starting at the age of 4 weeks, and sacrificed 6 weeks later. Compared with vehicle-treated rats, p38 inhibitor-treated rats exhibited a significant increase in pancreatic <re> cell death <er> and inflammation as assessed by histologic examination and myeloperoxidase activity, respectively. p38 inhibition decreased the expression of heat shock protein 27 (<el> HSP27 <le>), an antioxidant protein, and enhanced accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, the proapoptotic protein BAD was increased in the pancreas of rats treated with p38 inhibitor. 
Cadmium (<el> Cd <le>) is a serious toxic metal, which is classified as a possible human carcinogen. We assessed the effects of <el> Cd <le> on the expression levels of homeobox genes, which are associated with carcinogenesis. Among 6 homeobox genes examined in this study, only <re> HOX <er>B8 exhibited increased mRNA expression in COS-7 cells treated with 10 microM <el> Cd <le>Cl(2). Semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the <re> HOX <er>B8 mRNA level was increased by a maximum of 5.4-fold after 6h of <el> Cd <le> exposure. The levels of <re> HOX <er>A7, A9, C4, C9 and C10 mRNAs decreased from 0.1 to 0.3-fold. Silencing of <re> HOX <er>B8 mRNA expression using a siRNA increased <re> HOX <er>C9 and C10 mRNA expression levels by 6.6- and 1.9-fold, respectively. These results suggest that <re> HOX <er>B8 upregulation is associated with suppression of <re> HOX <er>C9 and C10, and that decreased expression of <re> HOX <er>C9 and C10 after <el> Cd <le> exposure is partly due to <re> HOX <er>B8 induction. 
The protein-tyrosine kinase <el> Src <le> is known to potentiate the function of NMDA receptors, which is necessary for the induction of long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. With recombinant receptors composed of NR1-1a/NR2A or NR1-1a/2B subunits, <el> Src <le> reduces voltage-independent inhibition by the divalent cation <re> Zn2+ <er>. Thereby the function of recombinant NMDA receptors is potentiated by <el> Src <le> only when the <re> Zn2+ <er> level is sufficient to cause tonic inhibition. Here we investigated whether the <el> Src <le>-induced potentiation of NMDA receptor function in neurons is caused by reducing voltage-independent <re> Zn2+ <er> inhibition. Whereas chelating extracellular <re> Zn2+ <er> blocked the <el> Src <le>-induced potentiation of NR1-1a/2A receptors, we found that <re> Zn2+ <er> chelation did not affect the potentiation of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) currents by <el> Src <le> applied into hippocampal CA1 or CA3 neurons. Moreover, <el> Src <le> did not alter the <re> Zn2+ <er> concentration-inhibition relationship for NMDAR currents in CA1 or CA3 neurons. Also, chelating extracellular <re> Zn2+ <er> did not prevent the upregulation of NMDA single-channel activity by endogenous <el> Src <le> in membrane patches from spinal dorsal horn neurons. 
Long chain unsaturated fatty acids stimulate phosphorylase "a" activity in liver cells. Similar degree of activation was achieved by increasing cellular <el> Ca2 <le>+ content or by treatment with agents other than oleate, like 1,2-diolein or phorbol esters, sharing in common their ability to activate <re> protein kinase C. <er> In <el> Ca2 <le>+-loaded liver cells only phenylephrine was capable of inducing a further stimulation of phosphorylase "a" activity. 
1. The use of traditional Chinese medicinal herbs or their pharmaceutical products for disease prevention and management is becoming increasingly popular in Western countries. Mixtures of various Chinese herbs have been used for the treatment of syndromes clinically overlapping Western cardiovascular syndromes. One modern preparation, known as the 'Cardiotonic Pill' (<el> CP <le>), is a pharmaceutical product derived mainly from a medicinal herb, Salvia miltiorrhiza bunge, and recently widely used in Chinese hospitals for the prevention and management of ischaemic cardiovascular diseases. Although the <el> CP <le> is believed to confer an extensive range of benefits, little is known about the physiological actions of this medicine, particularly at the cellular and molecular levels. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to explore possible cellular mechanisms of the <el> CP <le> on the cardiovascular system. 2. Cultured human vascular endothelial cells (EC) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) were exposed to the <el> CP <le> at various concentrations for periods ranging from hours to days. Cellular DNA synthesis was determined by a [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation assay, proliferation and death were assessed by investigations of cell numbers and apoptosis, whereas the expression of extracellular adhesion molecules was analysed by flow-cytometry and Western blotting. 3. The <el> CP <le> extract at concentrations of less than 200 microg/mL was not associated with cell damage. At doses beyond the therapeutic range (10-20 microg/mL), the <el> CP <le> appeared to exert a mild inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis and proliferation of EC in serum-enriched cultures. The <el> CP <le> significantly attenuated tumour necrosis factor-alpha-induced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in a dose-dependent manner, with 50 and 100 microg/mL <el> CP <le> producing decreases in the <re> expression of ICAM-1 <er> of 26-32% and 32-44%, respectively, and of VCAM-1 of approximately 23% and 27-42%, respectively. The <el> CP <le> did not affect apoptosis in EC under conditions of serum-deprivation. 4. In VSMC, the <el> CP <le> significantly inhibited platelet-derived growth factor BB-induced DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The <el> CP <le> did not affect VSMC expression of adhesion molecules. 5. 
We investigated the role of the <re> NO <er>/<el> cGMP <le> system in the vasodilatory response to hypercapnia after cortical spreading depression (CSD) in barbiturate anesthetized rats in vivo. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF). Hypercapnia (arterial pCO2 50-60 mm Hg) increased rCBF by 2.8+/-1.0%/mm Hg (n = 34). Fifteen minutes after CSD, resting rCBF was reduced to 87%, and rCBF response to hypercapnia was abolished (p < 0.001, n = 28). Within 1 h after CSD, only little restoration of vascular reactivity occurred. Topical application of the <re> NO <er>-donors S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN1), or spermine/<re> NO <er> complex (Sperm/<re> NO <er>), or of the cell permeable guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (<el> cGMP <le>) analogue 8-Br-<el> cGMP <le> reestablished resting rCBF to values measured before CSD, and reversed CSD-induced attenuation of the cerebrovascular response to hypercapnia. Restoration of resting rCBF to pre-CSD level by the <re> NO <er>-independent vasodilator papaverine had no effect on the attenuated hypercapnic response. 
Remyelination is a critical step for recovery of function after demyelination and defines the ability to generate new myelin. This repair process is dependent on the presence of resident oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs) that have been shown to remyelinate axons after demyelination. We have previously shown that the levels of the <re> cell cycle <er> inhibitor <el> p27Kip-1 <le> modulate the number of neonatal cortical OLPs. We now asked whether this <re> cell cycle <er> molecule plays also a role in regulating the number of adult OLP in the spinal cord after demyelination induced by lysolecithin injection. The proliferative response of OLP in the spinal cord of injected wild-type (wt) and <el> p27Kip-1 <le> null mice was evaluated 3 days after lesion. In vivo labeling with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was used to identify cells in S phase. Double immunofluorescence for the OLP marker NG2, and for BrdU was used to count the number of proliferating progenitors. Consistent with a role of <el> p27Kip-1 <le> in regulating the number of adult OLP in the injured spinal cord, a larger number of proliferating OLPs was observed in <el> p27Kip-1 <le>null mice compared with wild-type controls. These cells were able to differentiate as assessed by the presence of MBP+ cells in the spinal cord 14 days after injury. 
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a common kidney disease that results in nephrotic syndrome. FSGS arises from dysfunction and <re> apoptosis <er> of podocytes in the glomerulus of the kidney, leading to podocytopathy. The molecular mechanisms underlying podocyte <re> apoptosis <er> remain incompletely understood. Using an array of gene expression profiling, PCR and in situ hybridization assay, we found here that the levels of the long noncoding RNA LOC105374325 were elevated in the renal podocytes of individuals with FSGS. We also observed that the microRNAs miR-34c and miR-196a/b down-regulated the expression of the <re> apoptosis <er> regulators BCL2-associated X, <re> apoptosis <er> regulator (Bax) and BCL2 antagonist/killer 1 (<el> Bak <le>) in podocytes. Competitive binding between LOC105374325 and miR-34c or miR-196a/b increased Bax and <el> Bak <le> levels and caused podocyte <re> apoptosis <er>. Of note, the mitogen-activated protein kinase P38 and the transcription factor CCAAT enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) up-regulated LOC105374325 expression. P38 inhibition or C/EBPβ silencing decreased LOC105374325 levels and inhibited <re> apoptosis <er> in Adriamycin-treated podocytes. LOC105374325 overexpression decreased miR-34c and miR-196a/b levels, increased Bax and <el> Bak <le> levels, and induced proteinuria and focal segmental lesions in mice. 
To determine the influence of intrinsic medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) neurons on regional brain catecholamine turnover, dopamine (DA) and its metabolites were assayed in several brain areas 14 and 28 days after bilateral ibotenic acid (IA) lesions of the MPFC in the rat. The locomotor response to D-<el> amphetamine <le> was also assessed. On the 14th postoperative day levels of DA, homovanillic acid concentrations and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid were elevated in the anterior striatum of IA-lesioned animals. Spontaneous and <el> amphetamine <le>-induced <re> locomotion <er> were also increased. These changes disappeared by the 28th postoperative day. 
The isoquinolinesulfonamide PKC inhibitors <el> H-7 <le> and H-8 inhibit primary, in vivo generated cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity by 50% at concentrations approximating their reported Ki values for PKC, 6 uM and 15 uM respectively. However, a greater than ten-fold higher concentration of <el> H-7 <le> (100 uM) is required to reduce secondary or clone 8F CTL-mediated cytotoxicity by 50%. At this concentration <el> H-7 <le> is also reported to inhibit calmodulin (<re> CaM <er>)-dependent enzymes. To distinguish between the effect of 100 uM <el> H-7 <le> on PKC versus <re> CaM <er> the napthalenesulfonamide <re> CaM <er> antagonist W-7 was investigated. W-7 inhibited primary, secondary and clone 8F CTL-mediated cytolysis by 50% near its reported Ki value for <re> CaM <er>-dependent kinase activity, 12 uM. 
The major mechanism of imatinib (IM) resistance of CML is the reactivation of ABL kinase either through BCR-ABL gene amplification or mutation. We investigated the cytotoxicity of a pan-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor, <re> ponatinib <er>, and a pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor, <el> panobinostat <le>, against IM-resistant CML cells in vitro. Two different IM-resistant cell lines, K562/IM-R1 and Ba/F3/T315I were evaluated in comparison with their respective, parental cell lines, K562 and Ba/F3. K562/IM-R1 overexpressed BCR-ABL due to gene amplification. Ba/F3/T315I was transfected with a BCR-ABL gene encoding T315I-mutated BCR-ABL. Ponatinib inhibited the growth of both K562/IM-R1 and Ba/F3/T315I as potently as it inhibited their parental cells with an IC50 of 2-30 nM. Panobinostat also similarly inhibited the growth of all of the cell lines with an IC50 of 40-51 nM. This was accompanied by reduced histone deacetylase activity, induced histone H3 acetylation, and an increased protein level of heat shock protein 70, which suggested disruption of heat shock protein 90 chaperone function for BCR-ABL and its degradation. Importantly, the combination of <re> ponatinib <er> with <el> panobinostat <le> showed synergistic growth inhibition and induced a higher level of apoptosis than the sum of the apoptosis induced by each agent alone in all of the cell lines. Ponatinib inhibited phosphorylation not only of BCR-ABL but also of downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription 5, protein kinase B, and ERK1/2 in both K562/IM-R1 and Ba/F3/T315I, and the addition of <el> panobinostat <le> to <re> ponatinib <er> further inhibited these phosphorylations. 
The alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay was applied to study genotoxic properties of two inhalation anesthetics-halothane and <el> isoflurane <le>-in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (<re> PBL <er>). The cells were exposed in vitro to either halothane (2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane) or <el> isoflurane <le> (1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether) at concentrations 0.1-10 mM in DMSO. The anesthetics-induced DNA strand breaks as well as alkali-labile sites were measured as total comet length (i.e., increase of a DNA migration). Both analysed drugs were capable of increasing DNA migration in a dose-dependent manner. In experiments conducted at two different electrophoretic conditions (0. 56 and 0.78 V/cm), halothane was able to increase DNA migration to a higher extent than <el> isoflurane <le>. The comet assay detects DNA strand breaks induced directly by genotoxic agents as well as DNA degradation due to cell death. For this reason a contribution of toxicity in the observed effects was examined. We tested whether the exposed <re> PBL <er> were able to repair halothane- and <el> isoflurane <le>-induced DNA damage. The treated cells were incubated in a drug-free medium at 37 degrees C for 120 min to allow processing of the induced DNA damage. <re> PBL <er> exposed to <el> isoflurane <le> at 1 mM were able to complete repair within 60 min whereas for halothane a similar result was obtained at a concentration lower by one order of magnitude: the cells exposed to halothane at 1 mM removed the damage within 120 min only partly. 
<el> PEA-15 <le>/PED (phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes 15 kDa/phosphoprotein enriched in diabetes) is a death effector domain-containing protein which is known to modulate apoptotic cell death. The mechanism by which <el> PEA-15 <le> inhibits caspase activation and increases ERK (extracellular-regulated kinase) activity is well characterized. Here, we demonstrate that <el> PEA-15 <le> is not only pivotal in the activation of the ERK pathway but also modulates JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) signaling. Upon overexpression of <el> PEA-15 <le> in malignant glioma cells, JNK is potently activated. The <el> PEA-15 <le>-induced JNK activation depends on the phosphorylation of <el> PEA-15 <le> at both phosphorylation sites (serine 104 and serine 116). The activation of JNK is substantially inhibited by siRNA-mediated down-regulation of endogenous <el> PEA-15 <le>. Moreover, we demonstrate that glioma cells overexpressing <el> PEA-15 <le> show increased signs of <re> autophagy <er> in response to classical autophagic stimuli such as ionizing irradiation, serum deprivation, or rapamycin treatment. In contrast, the non-phosphorylatable mutants of <el> PEA-15 <le> are not capable of promoting <re> autophagy <er>. The inhibition of JNK abrogates the <el> PEA-15 <le>-mediated increase in <re> autophagy <er>. 
Thyrotropin-releasing hormone is a tripeptide that consists of <re> 5-oxoproline <er>, histidine, and proline. The peptide is rapidly metabolized by various enzymes. 5-Oxoproline is produced by enzymatic hydrolysis in a variety of peptides. Previous studies showed that <re> 5-oxoproline <er> could become a possible biomarker for autism spectrum disorders. Here we demonstrate the involvement of <el> SLC16A1 <le> in the transport of <re> 5-oxoproline <er>. An <el> SLC16A1 <le> polymorphism (rs1049434) was recently identified. However, there is no information about the effect of the polymorphism on <el> SLC16A1 <le> function. In this study, the polymorphism caused an observable change in <re> 5-oxoproline <er> and lactate transport via <el> SLC16A1 <le>. The Michaelis constant (Km) was increased in an <el> SLC16A1 <le> mutant compared with that in the wild type. In addition, the proton concentration required to produce half-maximal activation of transport activity (K0.5, H (+)) was increased in the <el> SLC16A1 <le> mutant compared with that in the wild type. Furthermore, we examined the transport of <re> 5-oxoproline <er> in T98G cells as an astrocyte cell model. Despite the fact that <re> 5-oxoproline <er> is an amino acid derivative, Na(+)-dependent and amino acid transport systems scarcely contributed to <re> 5-oxoproline <er> transport. 
Twelve males with moderately severe essential hypertension (mean arterial pressure [MAP] ranging 113-162 mmHg) were studied at rest supine and sitting and during bicycle exercise (50, 100 and 150 W). Intraarterial blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR) were recorded continuously. Cardiac output (CO) was measured by dye dilution (Cardiogreen). After 6-8 months (<el> enalapril <le> dose 10-40 mg daily) patients were restudied. BP fell in all patients, at rest sitting from 184/107 mmHg to 150/87 (-19%) and during 100 W from 223/117 to 194/98 mmHg (p less than 0.001). Pretreatment total peripheral resistance index (<re> TPRI <er>) was greatly increased in all patients and fell from 4137 to 3651 dyn s cm-5 m2 (-16%) (p less than 0.05). No significant changes were seen in CO, HR or stroke volume. No side effects were seen. 
Previous studies suggested that metabotropic glutamate 5 (<el> mGlu5 <le>) receptors play an important role in the reinforcing effects of abused drugs. The present experiments evaluated the effects of the <el> mGlu5 <le> receptor antagonist, MPEP (2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine hydrochloride; 1-10 mg/kg, salt, i.p.), in rat models of <re> nicotine <er>-seeking behavior that may have relevance to relapse to drug-taking. Male Wistar rats (with restricted access to food) were trained to nose-poke to receive intravenous infusions of <re> nicotine <er> (0.03 mg/kg per infusion, base) under a fixed ratio 5 time out 60 s schedule of reinforcement. After stable <re> nicotine <er> self-administration was acquired, nose-poking behavior was extinguished in the absence of <re> nicotine <er>-associated cues. During the reinstatement test phase, independent groups of animals were exposed to: (a) response-contingent <re> nicotine <er>-associated cues (cue-induced reinstatement); or (b) response-noncontingent presentations of 45-mg food pellets under fixed time 2 min schedule (schedule-induced reinstatement). Additional control experiments were conducted to demonstrate that in <re> nicotine <er>-naïve animals MPEP does not affect cue-induced reinstatement of food-seeking behavior and has no effects on operant behavior maintained by a simple fixed interval 2 min schedule of food reinforcement. Pretreatment with MPEP (10 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the reinstatement of <re> nicotine <er>-seeking in both experiments. Further, MPEP (10 mg/kg) significantly attenuated polydipsia induced by a fixed time 2 min food schedule. 
The K+ channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) causes epileptiform activity in in vitro preparations and is a potent convulsant in animals and man. In mice, 4-AP produces behavioral activation, clonic limb movements and wild running, followed by tonic hindlimb extension and death (ED97, 13.3 mg/kg, s.c.). We evaluated the ability of a series of anticonvulsant drugs to protect against 4-AP-induced <re> seizure <er>s using lethality as the endpoint. Drugs with a <el> phenytoin <le>-like profile of activity were protective with ED50 values (all in mg/kg, i.p.) of 34.4 for <el> phenytoin <le>, 18.6 for carbamazepine, 26.9 for felbamate, and 41.5 for zonisamide. Phenobarbital and valproate also protected against 4-AP-induced <re> seizure <er>s and lethality (ED50s, 30.6 and 301, respectively). In contrast the NMDA antagonists (+/-)-CPP and (+)-MK-801 were inactive as were the GABA enhancers diazepam, vigabatrin and tiagabine; the antiabsence drug ethosuximide; and the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nimodipine. 
The proteolytic maturation of cathepsin D polypeptides was studied in lysosomes isolated from metabolically labeled fibroblasts. In lysosomes isolated from fibroblasts labeled with [35S]methionine, 70-95% of labeled cathepsin D polypeptides were represented by a Mr = 47,000 polypeptide after a 20-min pulse and 75-min chase. When these lysosomes were incubated in vitro, up to 70% of the Mr = 47,000 polypeptide was processed to mature cathepsin D polypeptides. The processing was dependent on the integrity of the lysosomes, had an optimum between pH 6 and 7, and could be stimulated by dithiothreitol and <el> ATP <le>. The noncleavable <el> ATP <le> analogue, adenosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate, and GTP, CTP, and UTP could not substitute for <el> ATP <le>. The <el> ATP <le>-dependent stimulation was associated with an <re> acidification <er> of lysosomes. It was inhibited by agents that dissipate the lysosomal pH gradient (carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, nigericin, NH4Cl). A stimulatory effect of <el> ATP <le> was observed also at pH 5.5. The stimulation at pH 5.5 was not associated with <re> acidification <er> of lysosomes and was resistant to protonophores. Inhibitors of lysosomal cysteine proteinases and N-ethylmaleimide inhibited the processing. In the presence of <el> ATP <le> the processing activity was partially protected from inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide. 
Caspase-8 (FLICE) can associate with and be activated by CD95 (APO-1/Fas), an <re> apoptosis <er>-inducing member of the Tumour Necrosis Factor receptor family. We find that, in Jurkat T cells, the DNA damaging anti-cancer drug <el> etoposide <le> induces <re> apoptosis <er> and, surprisingly, processing of caspase-8. Therefore, we have investigated whether <el> etoposide <le> involves CD95 receptor activation. We find that <el> etoposide <le> does not induce CD95 ligand expression at the mRNA level. In addition, blocking of CD95 receptor function with a specific antibody does not inhibit <el> etoposide <le>-induced <re> apoptosis <er>. Apparently, in Jurkat cells, <el> etoposide <le> can induce caspase-8 processing and <re> apoptosis <er> in a CD95-independent fashion. Likewise, we find that thymocytes from the CD95-deficient lpr/lpr mouse strain readily undergo <re> apoptosis <er> in response to <el> etoposide <le>. Moreover, since inhibition of the secretory pathway with brefeldin A does not inhibit <el> etoposide <le>-induced <re> apoptosis <er>, we exclude the requirement for a newly synthesized receptor ligand to induce the apoptotic pathway. 
Glucocorticoids (GCs) stimulate appetite, contributing to enhanced fat deposition. Our present study was conducted to determine whether GCs could evoke an appetite specifically for fat-rich diets in chicks. Chicks were subjected to a subcutaneous injection of corticosterone (<el> CORT <le>, 2mg/kg body weight/day) or corn oil (control), and food preference was tested. The results showed that <el> CORT <le>-chicks consumed more high-fat diet (HFD) compared with controls. In HFD-fed chicks, hypothalamic phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase α (<re> AMPK <er>α) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA levels were increased by <el> CORT <le> treatment. Activating <re> AMPK <er> with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside, an <re> AMPK <er> activator, via intracerebroventricular injection further enhanced the <el> CORT <le>-induced HFD consumption and concurrently up-regulated NPY mRNA levels and phosphorylated <re> AMPK <er>α and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase levels. The dramatic increase in HFD consumption and upregulation of NPY mRNA levels and phospho-<re> AMPK <er>α levels induced by peripheral <el> CORT <le> injection was not altered by intracerebroventricular infusion of compound C (4-16μg), an <re> AMPK <er> inhibitor. 
The effects of parathyroidectomy (PTX) on the development of <re> nephrocalcinosis <er> in rats fed a diet containing alpha protein were investigated for the purpose of determining whether the <re> nephrocalcinosis <er> was <el> phosphate <le>-induced. PTX completely prevented the occurrence of <re> nephrocalcinosis <er> in rats fed a <el> phosphate <le>-supplemented commercial laboratory diet for 4 weeks. However, PTX did not completely prevent the occurrence of <re> nephrocalcinosis <er> in rats fed a <el> phosphate <le>-supplemented alpha protein diet. Several calciferous deposits were found in the inner medulla. The same was also found in rats that underwent sham operations and PTX rats fed the basal alpha protein diet. Total renal calcium and phosphorous levels in these three groups were also similar and were about twice as great as those in corresponding groups fed <el> phosphate <le>-supplemented and unsupplemented commercial laboratory diets. 
Murine splenocytes incubated for 3 to 4 days with the lymphokine, IL-2, acquire the ability to mediate the lysis of a wide variety of fresh tumor targets in short term chromium release assays. We undertook these studies to examine the lysis of splenocyte blasts by these lymphokine-activated killer (<el> LAK <le>) cells, to help gain an understanding of the mechanisms of target cell recognition. Allogeneic blast targets but not syngeneic blasts are highly lysable by <el> LAK <le> effector cells. By using congenic mice, we have shown that only the H-2 haplotype, and not other differences, determines the recognition and lysis of a blast target cell. Both Con A- and LPS-induced allogeneic splenocyte blasts are lysed and thus lectin-induced binding of effectors and targets is unlikely to be responsible for this effect. By using in vivo antibody depletion experiments, we showed that different populations of effector cells mediate the lysis of tumor cells and allogeneic blasts. Furthermore, we observed that the lysis of a susceptible blast can be inhibited only by like cold blasts of the same haplotype. These results suggest that there is a separate population of <el> LAK <le> cells responsible for the lysis of each type of blast target cell. Though syngeneic blasts were not lysed by <el> LAK <le> cells, TNP modification of syngeneic blasts converted them into cells that were recognized and lysed by <el> LAK <le> cells. In cold target inhibition studies, the lysis of fresh syngeneic tumor was not inhibited by TNP-modified syngeneic blasts. Similarly, the lysis of TNP-modified syngeneic blasts was not inhibited by fresh tumor. By using in vitro antibody depletion, we determined that TNP-modified blasts are lysed by <el> LAK <le> cells with Thy-1+ precursors, in distinction to the <re> Thy-1- precursors <er> involved in tumor cell lysis. Elimination of the Thy-1+ cells at the precursor stage completely abrogated the lysis of blasts but did not diminish the lysis of tumor cells. 
Transmembrane tryptase (TMT)/tryptase gamma is a membrane-bound serine <el> protease <le> stored in the secretory granules of human and mouse lung mast cells (MCs). We now show that TMT reaches the external face of the plasma membrane when MCs are induced to degranulate. Analysis of purified recombinant TMT revealed that it is a two-chain neutral <el> protease <le>. Thus, TMT is the only MC <el> protease <le> identified so far which retains its 18-residue propeptide when proteolytically activated. The genes that encode TMT and tryptase betaI reside on human chromosome 16p13.3. However, substrate specificity studies revealed that TMT and tryptase betaI are functionally distinct even though they are approximately 50% identical. Although TMT is rapidly inactivated by the human plasma serpin alpha(1)-antitrypsin in vitro, administration of recombinant TMT (but not recombinant tryptase betaI) into the trachea of mice leads to airway hyperresponsiveness (<re> AHR <er>) and increased expression of interleukin (IL) 13. T cells also increase their expression of IL-13 mRNA when exposed to TMT in vitro. TMT is therefore a novel exocytosed surface mediator that can stimulate those cell types that are in close proximity. TMT induces <re> AHR <er> in normal mice but not in transgenic mice that lack signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 6 or the alpha-chain of the cytokine receptor that recognizes both IL-4 and IL-13. 
We have previously demonstrated that the basal <re> transcription <er> of rat inhibin alpha-subunit gene in a mouse testicular Leydig tumor cell line, MA-10, depends upon a 67-bp DNA fragment at the position of -163 to -97. Within this promoter region two GATA motifs were observed. In this study, we investigated the possible role of GATA-binding proteins in the regulation of inhibin alpha-subunit gene <re> transcription <er> in testicular cells. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses showed that mRNAs encoding GATA-binding proteins, GATA-1 and <el> GATA-4 <le>, were detected in mouse and rat testis and in MA-10 and rat Sertoli cells. Testis-specific GATA-1 mRNA, which is transcribed from a promoter 8 kb upstream to the erythroid exon I of mouse GATA-1 gene, was also identified in MA-10 cells. Mutations of GATA sequences in alpha-subunit promoter markedly decreased the <re> transcription <er>al activity of alpha-subunit gene when measured by their ability of transient expression of a bacterial reporter gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), in MA-10 cells. Cotransfection of alphaCAT chimeric construct with cDNA expression plasmid coding for mouse GATA-1 or <el> GATA-4 <le> protein revealed that GATA-1 but not <el> GATA-4 <le> can transactivate alpha-subunit promoter in a dose-dependent manner. The transactivation by GATA-1 was inhibited if GATA sequences in alpha-subunit promoter were mutated. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that GATA-binding proteins present in nuclear extracts of MA-10 cells and rat testis interacted with the GATA motifs in alpha-subunit promoter, and the GATA-1 in these nuclear extracts formed a supershifted immunocomplex with antibody raised against mouse GATA-1 protein. 
Previously, we showed that mild heat shock modulates patterns of cell death in response to glucose deprivation (<el> GD <le>), a common characteristic of the tumor microenvironment, by switching <re> necrosis <er> to apoptosis through ERK-dependent suppression of reactive oxygen species production in A549 cells. In the present study, we further examined the molecular mechanism underlying mild heat shock-induced <re> necrosis <er>-to-apoptosis switch. We examined the possible implication of p53 and heat shock proteins (HSPs) in the mechanism. Inhibition of p53 by pifithrin-alpha or p53 siRNA markedly suppressed apoptosis induced by heat shock/<el> GD <le>. On the other hand, silencing of HSP27, but not of HSP70, reversed heat shock/<el> GD <le>-induced apoptosis to <re> necrosis <er>, and HSP27 overexpression suppressed <el> GD <le>-induced <re> necrosis <er>. We further demonstrate that mild heat shock activated AKT and ERK1/2 through phosphorylation. Prevention of PI3K by LY294002 blocked heat shock/<el> GD <le>-induced apoptosis without reversing the cell death mode to <re> necrosis <er>, while inhibition of MEK1/2 by U0126 reversed heat shock/<el> GD <le>-induced apoptosis to <re> necrosis <er>, indicating a different role(s) of PI3K and ERK1/2 in heat shock/<el> GD <le>-induced cell death mode determination. We also found that mild heat shock increased HSP27 and p53 protein levels dependent on PI3K and suppressed the <el> GD <le>-induced increase in RIPA-insoluble HSP27 and p53 protein levels dependent on PI3K and ERK1/2. 
A prolonged or excessive adrenergic activation leads to myocyte loss and heart dysfunction; however, how it contributes to <re> heart failure <er> remains poorly defined. Here we show that isoproterenol (<el> ISO <le>) induced aberrant endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptotic cell death, which was inhibited by activating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in vitro and in vivo. Persistent <el> ISO <le> stimulation suppressed the AMPK phosphorylation and function, resulting in enhanced ER stress and the subsequent cell apoptosis in cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo. AMPK activation decreased the aberrant ER stress, apoptosis, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) release in <el> ISO <le>-treated cardiomyocytes, which was blocked by AMPK inhibitor Compound C. Importantly, increased ER stress and apoptosis were observed in <el> ISO <le>-treated cardiomyocytes isolated from AMPKα2(-/-) mice. Inhibition of ER stress attenuated the apoptosis but failed to reverse AMPK inhibition in <el> ISO <le>-treated cardiomyocytes. Moreover, metformin administration activated AMPK and reduced both ER stress and apoptosis in <el> ISO <le>-induced rat <re> heart failure <er> in vivo. 
Immunogenic cell death (ICD) offers interesting opportunities in cancer cell (<el> CC <le>) vaccine manufacture, as it increases the immunogenicity of the dead <el> CC <le>. Furthermore, fusion of <el> CC <le>s with dendritic cells (DCs) is considered a superior method for generating whole <el> CC <le> vaccines. Therefore, in this work, we determined in naive mice whether immunogenically killed <el> CC <le>s per se (<el> CC <le> vaccine) elicit an antitumoral <re> immune response <er> different from the response observed when immunogenically killed <el> CC <le>s are associated with DCs through fusion (fusion vaccine) or through co-incubation (co-incubation vaccine). After tumor inoculation, the type of <re> immune response <er> in the prophylactically vaccinated mice differed between the groups. In more detail, fusion vaccines elicited a humoral anticancer response, whereas the co-incubation and <el> CC <le> vaccine mainly induced a cellular response. Despite these differences, all three approaches offered a prophylactic protection against tumor development in the murine mammary carcinoma model. 
Icariin has been shown to attenuate diabetic nephropathy in rats by decreasing transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and <re> type <er> IV collagen expression, but its mode of action in glomerular mesangial cells is uncertain. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of <el> icariin <le> on excess mesangial <re> type <er> IV collagen and fibronectin accumulation induced by high glucose, and to determine the mechanism underlying its protective effects. Under high-glucose conditions, <el> icariin <le> diminished <re> type <er> IV collagen and fibronectin accumulation, as well as TGF-β production in human and rat mesangial cells. Mesangial cells treated with <el> icariin <le> after TGF-β1 exposure expressed less <re> type <er> IV collagen and fibronectin than those without <el> icariin <le> treatment, suggesting inhibition by <el> icariin <le> of TGF-β1 downstream pathways. On TGF-β1 stimulation, <el> icariin <le> inhibited TGF-β canonical Smad signalling and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 signalling by decreasing Smad2/3 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. U0126, which blocked the ERK1/2 pathway, exerted an additive effect on the <el> icariin <le> suppression of <re> type <er> IV collagen and fibronectin expression, enhancing the beneficial effects of <el> icariin <le>. The G protein-coupled oestrogen receptor 1 (GPER) antagonist, G-15, abolished the <el> icariin <le>-induced inhibition of <re> type <er> IV collagen, and fibronectin overproduction and TGF-β signalling. Treatment of cells with fulvestrant, a downregulator of the oestrogen receptor, enhanced the action of <el> icariin <le>. 
Adenosine inhibits rat vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) growth. However, the effects of <el> adenosine <le> on human vascular <re> SMC proliferation <er> and synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagen, are unknown. The objective of this study was to characterize the effects of exogenous and endogenous (SMC-derived) <el> adenosine <le> on human aortic <re> SMC proliferation <er> and collagen synthesis. Growth-arrested SMCs were stimulated with 2.5% fetal calf serum (FCS) in the presence and absence of <el> adenosine <le>, 2-chloroadenosine (stable <el> adenosine <le> analogue), and with agents that increase endogenous <el> adenosine <le> levels, including erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine (EHNA), dipyridamole, and iodotubericidin. All of these agents inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner FCS-induced <re> SMC proliferation <er> as assessed by DNA synthesis (3H-thymidine incorporation) and cell counting, as well as collagen synthesis (3H-proline incorporation). EHNA, dipyridamole, and iodotubericidin increased extracellular levels of <el> adenosine <le> by 1.7-fold to 18-fold when added separately to SMCs, and EHNA+iodotubericidin and EHNA+iodotubericidin+dipyridamole increased extracellular <el> adenosine <le> levels by more than 392-fold. Both KF17837 (selective A2 antagonist) and DPSPX (A1/A2 antagonist), but not DPCPX (selective A1 antagonist), blocked the antimitogenic effects of 2-chloroadenosine, EHNA, and dipyridamole on DNA and collagen synthesis, suggesting the involvement of A2A and/or A2B, but excluding the participation of A1, receptors. The lack of effect of CGS21680 (selective A2A agonist), excluded involvement of A2A receptors and suggested a major role for A2B receptors. A comparison of the inhibitory potencies of 2-chloroadenosine, N6-cyclopentyladenosine (selective A1 agonist), NECA (A1/A2 agonist), and MECA (A1/A2 agonist) were consistent with an A2B receptor subtype mediating the inhibitory effects of <el> adenosine <le> on human aortic <re> SMC proliferation <er>. 
Leptin and somatostatin (<el> SRIF <le>) have opposite effects on food seeking and ingestive behaviors, functions partially regulated by the frontoparietal cortex and hippocampus. Although it is known that the acute suppression of food intake mediated by <re> leptin <er> decreases with time, the counter-regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Our aims were to analyze the effect of acute central <re> leptin <er> infusion on the <el> SRIF <le> receptor-effector system in these areas and the implication of related intracellular signaling mechanisms in this response. We studied 20 adult male Wister rats including controls and those treated intracerebroventricularly with a single dose of 5 μg of <re> leptin <er> and sacrificed 1 or 6h later. Density of <el> SRIF <le> receptors was unchanged at 1h, whereas <re> leptin <er> increased the density of <el> SRIF <le> receptors at 6h, which was correlated with an elevated capacity of <el> SRIF <le> to inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in both areas. The functional capacity of <el> SRIF <le> receptors was unaltered as cell membrane levels of αi1 and αi2 subunits of G inhibitory proteins were unaffected in both brain areas. The increased density of <el> SRIF <le> receptors was due to enhanced <el> SRIF <le> receptor subtype 2 (sst2) protein levels that correlated with higher mRNA levels for this receptor. These changes in sst2 mRNA levels were concomitant with increased activation of the insulin signaling, c-Jun and cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB); however, activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 was reduced in the cortex and unchanged in the hippocampus and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 remained unchanged in these areas. In addition, the <re> leptin <er> antagonist L39A/D40A/F41A blocked the <re> leptin <er>-induced changes in <el> SRIF <le> receptors, <re> leptin <er> signaling and CREB activation. 
Uric acid and oxidative stress promote cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis and hypertension. Xanthine oxidase, through which uric acid is generated, is a free-radical generating enzyme. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether <el> allopurinol <le>, an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase activity, affects <re> vascular remodeling <er> and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation. In the carotid artery ligation model using spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), treatment with <el> allopurinol <le> induced a reduction in the neointima/media ratio by 27% (38.5+/-34.3% in the control group and 28.1 20.8% in the <el> allopurinol <le>-treated group, respectively, p<0.01) without alterations in vascular circumference at 3 weeks after ligation when compared to the control. Allopurinol lowered the serum uric acid concentration (147.0+/-3.6 micromol/l in the control group and 16.1+/-3.6 micromol/l in the <el> allopurinol <le>-treated group, respectively p<0.01) and xanthine oxidase activity, but not the blood pressure. In an in vitro study, high concentrations of uric acid (100 and 200 micromol/l) stimulated VSMC growth, but there was no stimulation of these cells by a low concentration of uric acid (50 micromol/I) or by any of three concentrations of xanthine (50, 100 and 200 micromol/l). In addition, <el> allopurinol <le> (5 micromol/I) had no effect on the cell growth. 
Lithospermic acid B (LAB), an active component of danshen, is known to inhibit the <re> proliferation <er> of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and has pharmacological activity scavenging free radicals in VSMCs. However, the precise mechanism through which LAB exerts its antiproliferative effect is unclear. Therefore, we investigated how LAB regulates cellular <re> proliferation <er> in primary cultured rat VSMCs. Using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated LAB to track its cellular localization, we show that LAB localizes to the nucleus, specifically to the nucleolus, where it binds to histone H3, leading to the inhibition of the platelet-derived growth factor (<el> PDGF <le>)- induced phosphorylation of histone H3. LAB also only moves into the nucleus during the normal expression of nonmuscle myosin heavy chain (NMHC-IIA), which is associated with LAB in VSMCs. Notably, LAB suppressed the <el> PDGF <le>-induced phosphorylation of Akt and the expression of cyclin D2 in the presence of NMHC-IIA expression. Knockdown of NMHC-IIA expression impeded the function of LAB, which was then unable to inhibit the <el> PDGF <le>-induced <re> proliferation <er> of VSMCs. 
Adult male rats (n = 17/group, 300-320 g, physically untrained) were exercised (9.14 m/min) in the <re> heat <er> (35 degrees C) to hyperthermic exhaustion (rectal temperature 43 degrees C) after infusion of 2 ml of 7.5% sodium <el> bicarbonate <le> (BIC) or 2 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride (SAL). Rats receiving BIC or SAL had no effects on endurance when compared with rats receiving no exogenous fluid [control (CON]), whereas the rate of <re> heat <er> gain, was significantly increased in the BIC-treated group. After exercise, the BIC group manifested significantly decreased hematocrit and plasma protein levels but exaggerated increments in plasma osmolality. Lactate levels were significantly increased in all three groups with no notable intergroup differences. Although venous blood pH and <el> bicarbonate <le> levels were decreased after exercise in the SAL and CON groups, they were unchanged in the BIC group. Although venous PCO2 was unaffected by fluid administration in all three groups, venous PO2 was significantly increased after exercise in the <re> heat <er> in all groups. 
Wnts make up a large family of extracellular signaling molecules that play crucial roles in development and disease. A subset of noncanonical Wnts signal independently of the transcription factor β-catenin by a mechanism that regulates key morphogenetic movements during embryogenesis. The best characterized noncanonical Wnt, <re> Wnt5a <er>, has been suggested to signal via a variety of different receptors, including the <el> Ror <le> family of receptor tyrosine kinases, the Ryk receptor tyrosine kinase, and the Frizzled seven-transmembrane receptors. Whether one or several of these receptors mediates the effects of <re> Wnt5a <er> in vivo is not known. 
Brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMV) prepared from whole dog kidney cortex, or separately from outer cortex (<el> OC <le>) and outer medulla (OM), were used to study the kinetics and inhibition specificity of <re> Na <er>(+)-dependent D-mannose cotransport. In BBMV from whole cortex the measured parameters for <re> Na <er>+/D-mannose uptake were Km = 0.07 +/- 0.01 mM and Vmax = 4.19 +/- 0.24 nmol/mg protein per min (n = 36). In <el> OC <le> BBMV the Km for <re> Na <er>+/D-mannose was 0.04 mM, Vmax = 3.41 nmol/mg per min. In OM the Km was 0.06 +/- 0.02 mM Vmax = 0.18 nmol/mg per min. Thus only about 5% of <re> Na <er>+/D-mannose activity occurs in OM. Both mannoheptulose (Ki = 5.6 mM) and methyl alpha-D-mannoside (Ki = 0.05 mM) are competitive inhibitors of <re> Na <er>+/D-mannose uptake, but at comparable concentrations have little effect on <re> Na <er>+/D-glucose uptake. Phlorizin is a noncompetitive inhibitor of <re> Na <er>+/D-mannose uptake (Ki = 4.45 microM) but a more potent and competitive inhibitor (Ki = 0.58 microM) of <re> Na <er>+/D-glucose uptake. Phloretin (Ki = 104 microM) is a noncompetitive inhibitor of <re> Na <er>+/D-mannose uptake in BBMV. 
<el> MyoD <le> functions as a master regulator to induce muscle-specific gene expression and myogenic differentiation. Here, we demonstrate a positive role of Protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (Prmt7) in <el> MyoD <le>-mediated <re> myoblast differentiation <er> through p38MAPK activation. Prmt7 depletion in primary or C2C12 myoblasts impairs cell cycle withdrawal and myogenic differentiation. Furthermore, Prmt7 depletion decreases the <el> MyoD <le>-reporter activities and the <el> MyoD <le>-mediated myogenic conversion of fibroblasts. Together with <el> MyoD <le>, Prmt7 is recruited to the Myogenin promoter region and Prmt7 depletion attenuates the recruitment of <el> MyoD <le> and its coactivators. The mechanistic study reveals that Prmt7 methylates p38MAPKα at the arginine residue 70, thereby promoting its activation which in turn enhances <el> MyoD <le> activities. The arginine residue 70 to alanine mutation in p38MAPKα impedes <el> MyoD <le>/E47 heterodimerization and the recruitment of Prmt7, <el> MyoD <le> and Baf60c to the Myogenin promoter resulting in blunted Myogenin expression. 
Around the world, Burkholderia spp. are emerging as pathogens highly resistant to β-lactam antibiotics, especially <re> ceftazidime <er>. Clinical variants of Burkholderia pseudomallei possessing the class A <el> β-lactamase <le> PenI with substitutions at positions C69 and P167 are known to demonstrate <re> ceftazidime <er> resistance. However, the biochemical basis for <re> ceftazidime <er> resistance in class A <el> β-lactamase <le>s in B. pseudomallei is largely undefined. Here, we performed site saturation mutagenesis of the C69 position and investigated the kinetic properties of the C69F variant of PenI from B. pseudomallei that results in a high level of <re> ceftazidime <er> resistance (2 to 64 mg/liter) when expressed in Escherichia coli. Surprisingly, quantitative immunoblotting showed that the steady-state protein levels of the C69F variant <el> β-lactamase <le> were ∼4-fold lower than those of wild-type PenI (0.76 fg of protein/cell versus 4.1 fg of protein/cell, respectively). However, growth in the presence of <re> ceftazidime <er> increases the relative amount of the C69F variant to greater than wild-type PenI levels. The C69F variant exhibits a branched kinetic mechanism for <re> ceftazidime <er> hydrolysis, suggesting there are two different conformations of the enzyme. When incubated with an anti-PenI antibody, one conformation of the C69F variant rapidly hydrolyzes <re> ceftazidime <er> and most likely contributes to the higher levels of <re> ceftazidime <er> resistance observed in cell-based assays. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the electrostatic characteristics of the oxyanion hole are altered in the C69F variant. When <re> ceftazidime <er> was positioned in the active site, the C69F variant is predicted to form a greater number of hydrogen-bonding interactions than PenI with <re> ceftazidime <er>. 
The purpose of the present study was to elucidate signaling pathways by which insulin like-growth factor 1 (<el> IGF1 <le>) promotes FSH-stimulated synthesis and retention of hyaluronic acid (<re> HA <er>) in pig oocyte-cumulus complexes (OCCs) cultured in serum-free medium. We found that <el> IGF1 <le> had no effects on FSH-stimulated production of cAMP and activation of protein kinase A in the OCCs. Immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies showed that FSH moderately phosphorylated v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT) and mitogen-activated kinase 3 and 1 (MAPK3/1) in cumulus cells. The exposure of OCCs to both FSH and <el> IGF1 <le> resulted in a significant (P < 0.05) increase in AKT and MAPK3/1 phosphorylation. An inhibitor of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PIK3), LY 294002, significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the <el> IGF1 <le>-enhanced phosphorylation of AKT, and inhibitors of AKT (SH6) and MAPK3/1 (U0126) significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the synthesis and retention of <re> HA <er> stimulated by concomitant exposure of OCCs to both FSH and <el> IGF1 <le>. The <el> IGF1 <le>-promoted synthesis of <re> HA <er> was not accompanied by an increase in the relative abundance of hyaluronan synthase 2 (<re> HA <er>S2) mRNA in the cumulus cells. 
Glucagon-like peptides (GLP-1/2) are cosecreted from endocrine L cells in the gut and preproglucagonergic neurons in the brain. Peripheral GLP-2 action is essential for maintaining intestinal homeostasis, improving absorption efficiency and blood flow, promoting immune defense, and producing efficacy in treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. However, it is unknown if CNS GLP-2 plays a physiological role in the control of energy homeostasis. Since GLP-1/2 are cotranslated from preproglucagongene and coproduced by prohormone convertase-1, it is challenging to knockout GLP-2 only. Instead, our laboratory has generated a Glp2r-floxed mouse line to dissect cell-specific GLP-2 receptor <el> GLP-2R <le>) action in the regulation of energy balance. Our objective was to determine if <el> GLP-2R <le> in the hypothalamus modulates feeding behavior and <re> gastric emptying <er>. We show that Glp2r mRNA and protein are highly expressed in the arcuate nucleus and dorsomedial nucleus of the mouse hypothalamus. Using the Cre-LoxP system, we generated mice that lack Glp2r expression in POMC neurons (KO; mainly in the hypothalamus). The KO mice showed hyperphagic behavior (such as increases in food intake and meal frequency), accelerated <re> gastric emptying <er> (assessed by [(13)C]octanoic acid breath test), and late-onset obesity, yet there was no decrease in basal metabolic rate. Infusion of GLP-2 (2.5 nmol into the 4th ventricle) suppressed food intake and <re> gastric emptying <er>, while GLP-2-mediated effects were abolished in the melanocortin receptor-4 (MC4R) KO mice. 
<el> CD47 <le> or integrin-associated protein promotes cell death in blood and tumor cells. Recently, <el> CD47 <le> signaling has been identified in neurons as well. In this study, we investigated the role of <el> CD47 <le> in <re> neuronal cell death <er>. Exposure of primary mouse cortical neurons to the <el> CD47 <le> ligand thrombospondin-1 or the specific <el> CD47 <le>-activating peptide 4N1K induced cell death. Activation of <el> CD47 <le> elevated levels of active caspase 3 and increased the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a time-dependent manner. Both ROS scavengers and caspase inhibitors attenuated cell death. But ROS scavenging did not reduce the activation of caspase 3, and combination treatments with a caspase inhibitor plus free radical scavenger did not yield additive protection. Taken together, these data suggest that parallel and redundant pathways of oxidative stress and caspase-mediated cell death are involved. 
All living organisms require accurate segregation of their genetic material. However, in microbes, <re> chromosome segregation <er> is less understood than replication and cell division, which makes its decipherment a compelling research frontier. Furthermore, it has only been studied in free-living microbes so far. Here, we investigated this fundamental process in a rod-shaped symbiont, Candidatus Thiosymbion oneisti. This gammaproteobacterium divides longitudinally as to form a columnar epithelium ensheathing its nematode host. We hypothesized that uninterrupted host attachment would affect bacterial chromosome dynamics and set out to localize specific chromosomal loci and putative DNA-segregating proteins by fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunostaining, respectively. First, DNA replication origins (ori) number per cell demonstrated symbiont monoploidy. Second, we showed that sister ori segregate diagonally prior to septation onset. Moreover, the localization pattern of the centromere-binding protein <el> ParB <le> recapitulates that of ori, and consistently, we showed recombinant <el> ParB <le> to specifically bind an ori-proximal site (parS) in vitro. Third, chromosome replication ends prior to cell fission, and as the poles start to invaginate, termination of replication (ter) sites localize medially, at the leading edges of the growing septum. They then migrate to midcell, concomitantly with septation progression and until this is completed. 
The hepatitis delta virus (<re> HDV <er>) genome consists of circular ssRNA which has extensive intramolecular complementarity and can form a dsRNA rod-like structure. If such RNA species were to exist in an unmasked form in cells, they would be expected to induce interferon (IFN) expression and activate two IFN-inducible dsRNA-dependent enzymes with anti-viral activity, namely the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and 2',5' oligoadenylate (2',5' A) synthetase. Since the virus replicates to high copy number for prolonged periods in infected cells it is apparently able to evade these antiviral mechanisms. The RNA genome may be masked and fail to induce or activate the antiviral response, or the virus may inhibit such a response. Treatment of a hepatoma cell line, Huh7, and a fibrosarcoma cell line, HT1080, stably transfected with a trimeric <re> HDV <er> cDNA construct, with <el> IFN-alpha <le> or IFN-gamma for up to seven days failed to influence the level of expression of genomic or antigenomic <re> HDV <er> RNA, or delta antigen (Ag). This is consistent with either failure of activation or inhibition of the IFN response. However the induction of several IFN-responsive genes, including PKR, 2',5' A synthetase and class I MHC is normal and cotransfection of a construct expressing delta Ag did not affect expression from an IFN-inducible chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct. In addition, the activation of PKR is not inhibited in <re> HDV <er>-expressing cells and antiviral assays suggest that the ability of these cells to mount an antiviral response to at least two cytopathic viruses is unaffected. IFN-beta is inducible normally by dsRNA in cells transfected with the delta cDNA trimer. 
Leukocyte rolling along the endothelium in inflammation is caused by continuous formation and breakage of bonds between <el> selectin <le> <re> adhesion <er> molecules and their ligands. We investigated trauma-induced leukocyte rolling in venules (diameter, 23 to 58 microns; wall shear stress, 1.2 to 35 dyne/cm2) of the exteriorized rat mesentery using high-resolution intravital microscopy. While rolling, the leukocytes deformed into a tear-droplike shape. Deformation continued to increase with shear stress up to the highest values observed (35 dyne/cm2). Successive leukocytes had similar rolling velocities at the same axial positions along each vessel, suggesting that heterogeneity of endothelial adhesiveness is responsible for velocity variation. Adhesion energy density varied inversely with instantaneous rolling velocity and directly with instantaneous deformation. Adhesion energy density reached a maximum of 0.36 dyne/cm, similar to values found for lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1-dependent <re> adhesion <er> of stimulated T cells to isolated intercellular <re> adhesion <er> molecule-1. 
Proteinase 3 (<re> PR3 <er>) is an abundant serine protease of neutrophil granules and a major target of autoantibodies (<re> PR3 <er> anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) in granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Some of the <re> PR3 <er> synthesized by promyelocytes in the bone marrow escapes the targeting to granules and occurs on the plasma membrane of naive and primed neutrophils. This membrane-associated <re> PR3 <er> antigen may represent pro-<re> PR3 <er>, mature <re> PR3 <er>, or both forms. To discriminate between mature <re> PR3 <er> and its inactive zymogen, which have different conformations, we generated and identified a monoclonal antibody called <el> MCPR3-7 <le>. It bound much better to pro-<re> PR3 <er> than to mature <re> PR3 <er>. This monoclonal antibody greatly reduced the catalytic activity of mature <re> PR3 <er> toward extended peptide substrates. Using diverse techniques and multiple recombinant <re> PR3 <er> variants, we characterized its binding properties and found that <el> MCPR3-7 <le> preferentially bound to the so-called activation domain of the zymogen and changed the conformation of mature <re> PR3 <er>, resulting in impaired catalysis and inactivation by α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1-antitrypsin). Noncovalent as well as covalent complexation between <re> PR3 <er> and α1-proteinase inhibitor was delayed in the presence of <el> MCPR3-7 <le>, but cleavage of certain thioester and paranitroanilide substrates with small residues in the P1 position was not inhibited. 
Myofibroblastic-activated hepatic stellate cells are the major source of the collagen I-rich extracellular matrix in liver fibrosis but also produce matrix metalloproteinases, which remodel this protein. We have investigated the role of collagen I <re> proteolysis <er> in both regulating <el> proliferation <le> and maintaining the activated myofibroblastic phenotype of stellate cells in vitro. Compared with stellate cells plated on normal collagen I, those plated on a collagenase-resistant form of collagen I (r/r collagen) had reduced thymidine incorporation and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression but increased p21 expression. Collagen I was shown to be rendered resistant to matrix metalloproteinases by artificial cross-linking in vitro using tissue transglutaminase exerted similar antiproliferative effects on stellate cells to r/r collagen. Of the stellate cell activation markers examined (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1, alpha-smooth muscle actin, matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9, and procollagen I) only the last was decreased by culture on r/r collagen relative to normal collagen I. Antagonists of integrin alphavbeta3, an integrin reported to stimulate stellate cell <el> proliferation <le>, significantly inhibited adhesion, <el> proliferation <le>, and procollagen I synthesis of stellate cells plated on normal collagen I but had reduced effectiveness on these parameters in cells on r/r collagen. 
1. The effects of purinergic stimulation on <re> action potential <er>, force of contraction, 86Rb efflux and 45Ca uptake were investigated in guinea-pig left atria. 2. Adenosine exerted a negative inotropic effect which was antagonized by adenosine deaminase but enhanced by dipyridamole. 3. The negative inotropic effect of adenosine was mimicked by 5'-(N-ethyl)-carboxamido-adenosine (NECA) and the isomers of N6-(phenyl-isopropyl)-adenosine, <el> R-PIA <le> and S-PIA. NECA and <el> R-PIA <le> were about 100 times more potent than adenosine, whereas <el> R-PIA <le> was about 100 times more potent than S-PIA. 4. The inotropic effects of adenosine (in the presence of dipyridamole), NECA, <el> R-PIA <le> and S-PIA were competitively antagonized either by theophylline (pA2 about 4.5) or 8-phenyltheophylline (pA2 about 6.3). 5. NECA and <el> R-PIA <le> shortened the <re> action potential <er> duration and increased the rate constant of the efflux of 86Rb in a concentration-dependent manner with no differences in potency; the effects were competitively antagonized by 8-phenyltheophylline. 6. Barium ions reduced the efflux of 86Rb under control conditions and antagonized the increase induced by NECA and <el> R-PIA <le>. 7. NECA and <el> R-PIA <le> significantly reduced 45Ca uptake in beating preparations. 8. 
The interaction of prostaglandins with changes in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]) and aggregation of human platelets induced by adenosine diphosphate (<el> ADP <le>) were investigated. Cytosolic [Ca2+] was measured with the fluorescent dye Quin2. Addition of <el> ADP <le> (0.25-2.5 mumol l-1) to platelet suspensions produced a dose dependent increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] from a basal level of 51 +/- 1 nmol l-1 to maximum levels exceeding 1 mumol l-1 and induced <re> platelet aggregation <er>. Chelation of extracellular calcium with 100 mumol l-1 EGTA markedly reduced the increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] induced by 0.25 mumol l-1 <el> ADP <le>, while pretreatment with the calcium entry blocker verapamil was without effect. Stimulation of cyclic AMP with prostaglandins (PGD2, PGE1, PGE2, PGI2, but not PGF2 alpha) and forskolin, or incubation with dibutyryl-cAMP, inhibited the rise in cytosolic [Ca2+] and <re> platelet aggregation <er> following <el> ADP <le>. 
It is currently believed that intrauterine devices cause pelvic inflammatory disease and tubal <re> infertility <er>. To investigate this concept further, we evaluated 245 infertile patients for inflammatory residues by laparoscopy or laparotomy; 176 patients had not used an intrauterine device and 69 had used one. Chlamydial antibody titers were performed on all patients. Although users had a higher overall prevalence of inflammatory residues than nonusers, there was no difference in residue prevalence for either group at the same titer level. No specific type of device appeared to be associated with either an increased or decreased residue frequency. "Silent" chlamydial <el> infections <le> occurred with equal frequency in both users and nonusers. 
Hypnosis and acupuncture can alleviate experimentally induced <re> pain <er> but the mechanism of analgesia remains unclear for both techniques. Experimental <re> pain <er> was induced by cold pressor test (CPT) in 8 male volunteers. Analgesic effect of hypnosis (HA) and acupuncture (<el> AA <le>) was assessed before and after double-blind administration of placebo or naloxone, in a prospective, cross-over study. We found that <re> pain <er> intensity was significantly lower with HA as compared with <el> AA <le>, both with naloxone (P less than 0.001) and placebo (P less than 0.001). Within HA or <el> AA <le> groups, <re> pain <er> scores did not differ significantly when naloxone or placebo was administered. During <el> AA <le>, however, <re> pain <er> scores were similar to control values when naloxone was given (P = 0.05) but decreased significantly with placebo (P less than 0.002). Analog scales for <re> pain <er> intensity and <re> pain <er> relief showed a good correlation (r = 0.94). Plasma levels of beta-endorphins did not change significantly in any combination. Heart rate, peripheral arterial blood pressure and skin conductance were very insensitive indices to assess <re> pain <er> intensity or relief, as well as intensity of acupuncture stimulation or depth of hypnotic trance. 
Early-life stress induces endocrine and metabolic alterations that increase food intake and overweight in adulthood. The stress response activates the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and urocortins' (Ucns) system in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). These peptides induce anorexic effects through <el> CRH-R2 <le> receptor activation; however, chronic stressed animals develop hyperphagia despite of high PVN CRH expression. We analyzed this paradoxical behavior in adult rats subjected to maternal separation (<re> MS <er>) for 180min/daily during post-natal days 2-14, evaluating their body weight gain, food intake, serum corticosterone and vasopressin concentrations, PVN mRNA expression of CRH-R1, <el> CRH-R2 <le>, CRH, Ucn2, Ucn3, vasopressin and <el> CRH-R2 <le> protein levels. <re> MS <er> adults increased their feeding, weight gain as well as circulating corticosterone and vasopressin levels, evincing chronic hyperactivity of the stress system. <re> MS <er> induced higher PVN CRH, Ucn2 and <el> CRH-R2 <le> mRNA expression and protein levels of <el> CRH-R2 <le> showed a tendency to decrease in the cellular membrane fraction. An intra-PVN injection of the <el> CRH-R2 <le> antagonist antisauvagine-30 in control adults increased receptor's mRNA expression, mimicking the observed PVN receptor's up-regulation of early-life <re> MS <er> adults. An injection of Ucn-2 directly into the PVN reduced food intake and increased PVN pCREB/CREB ratio in control animals; in contrast, Ucn-2 was unable to reduce food intake and enhance phosphorylated-CREB levels in PVN of <re> MS <er> rats. 
Previous data showed an association between low motile density (< 10 million motile/mL) and spontaneous abortion (<re> SAB <er>) following in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET). The purpose of this study was to determine if the same association existed following intrauterine insemination (IUI). A retrospective review of IUI pregnancies was conducted. Patients with antisperm antibodies, a low hypo-osmotic swelling (HOS) test score (< 50%), or those using donor sperm were excluded. A total of 52 couples were enrolled in the study: 34 in the normal motile density (<el> MD <le>) group and 18 in the low <el> MD <le> group. The <re> SAB <er> rate in the normal group was 29.4% and in the low group was 27.8%. 
Depending on the number of phosphate groups, diadenosine polyphosphates (ApnA, <el> Ap3A <le>, Ap4A, Ap5A and Ap6A) differ in properties such as <re> proliferation <er>, apoptosis, vasoconstriction and vasodilatation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Possible signaling pathways leading to effects such as <re> proliferation <er> are still unknown. This study examined the proliferative effects of diadenosine polyphosphates on VSMCs and their intracellular pathways. Proliferation of VSMCs was measured by the cell count and [(3)H] thymidine incorporation. Phosphorylation of the MAP kinases ERK1/2 was determined by Western blotting. Single-cell [Ca(2+)](i) measurements were done to determine the influence of [Ca(2+)](i) on intracellular signaling. Stress fiber formation was assessed by fluorescence microscopy to detect an influence of G alpha(12). <el> Ap3A <le> and Ap4A, but not Ap5A or Ap6A, were shown to increase <re> proliferation <er> of VSMCs by activating P2Y receptors, which leads to stimulation of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 cascade. <el> Ap3A <le>- and Ap4A-induced activation of the MAP kinases ERK1/2 was dependent on a signaling pathway that included the EGF receptor, PKC, PLCbeta and the increase of [Ca(2+)](i). 
Abdominal obesity and low cardiorespiratory fitness (<el> CRF <le>) are associated with <re> insulin <er> resistance in older adults. Exercise is associated with improvement in <re> insulin <er> sensitivity. Whether this association is mediated by change in <el> CRF <le> and/or abdominal obesity is unclear. The current study is a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial in Kingston, Ontario. Sedentary older adults (60-80 years) (N = 80) who completed the exercise (N = 59) or control (N = 21) conditions for 6 months were included. <el> CRF <le> was measured using a treadmill test, adipose tissue (AT) by magnetic resonance imaging, and <re> insulin <er> sensitivity by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Waist circumference (WC) was measured at the iliac crest. Mediation analyses were used to assess whether abdominal AT and/or <el> CRF <le> mediated the exercise-induced change in <re> insulin <er> sensitivity. By comparison to controls, reduction (mean ± SD) was observed for visceral (-0.4 ± 0.4 kg) and abdominal subcutaneous (-0.4 ± 0.4) AT depots, WC (-4.1 ± 3.2 cm) and BMI (-0.9 ± 0.8 kg/m2) (p < 0.05). Insulin sensitivity (4.2 ± 5.2 M/I) and <el> CRF <le> (0.2 ± 0.3 L/min) improved in the exercise group (p < 0.05). All AT variables, BMI and WC were mediators of the change in <re> insulin <er> sensitivity (p < 0.05). After adjustment for change in total AT, abdominal AT remained a mediator with an effect ratio of 0.79 (p < 0.05), whereas total AT was not significant when adjusted for abdominal AT (p > 0.05). The effect ratio for change in WC and BMI combined (0.63, p<0.05) was greater than either alone. 
The calcium-dependent release of [3H]dopamine ([3H]<re> DA <er>) elicited by field stimulation or potassium is modulated through activation of stereoselective inhibitory <re> DA <er> autoreceptors of the <el> D-2 subtype <le> that are pharmacologically different from the D-1 <re> DA <er> receptor subtype linked to the stimulation of adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1). The D-2 <re> DA <er> autoreceptors appear to be endogenously activated by <re> DA <er> because <re> DA <er> receptor antagonists such as S-sulpiride increased the stimulation-evoked release of [3H]<re> DA <er>. Nanomolar concentrations of norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner the electrical stimulation-evoked release of [3H]<re> DA <er>. The inhibitory effect of these catecholamines was not modified by S-sulpiride, which, on the contrary, selectively antagonized the inhibition of [3H]<re> DA <er> release elicited by exogenous <re> DA <er>. Phentolamine or (+/-)-propranolol did not affect the release of [3H]<re> DA <er> from rabbit retina. The alpha antagonist phentolamine competitively antagonized the inhibitory effect of both NE and E, which suggests that these catecholamines activate alpha receptors in retina. The decrease by catecholamines of the calcium-dependent release of [3H]<re> DA <er> appears not to involve beta adrenoceptors because their inhibitory effect was not modified by propranolol. Under identical experimental conditions (i.e., nomifensine, 30 microM), serotonin did not modify the stimulated release of [3H]<re> DA <er>. 
The dopaminergic and opioid systems have effects on the conditioned avoidance response (<re> CAR <er>), although the possible interaction between these systems on this behaviour has not been studied. The effects of <el> morphine <le> (12.6 mg/kg), haloperidol (0.075 mg/kg), sulpiride (20 mg/kg) and risperidone (0.1 mg/kg) alone as well as <el> morphine <le> combined with these dopamine (DA) antagonists on the acquisition and performance of the <re> CAR <er> were explored in mice. Morphine increased avoidances but this seemed secondary to a rise in activity levels. All DA antagonists impaired <re> CAR <er> in the acquisition phase but only haloperidol disrupted performance. The combination of <el> morphine <le> plus neuroleptics impaired acquisition and performance of <re> CAR <er>. These results suggest that <el> morphine <le> disrupts the learning of <re> CAR <er> and that the classical neuroleptic haloperidol profoundly impairs acquisition and performance of <re> CAR <er> to a greater degree than atypical neuroleptics such as sulpiride and risperidone. 
This study determined if dietary restriction (<el> DR <le>) protects against hypoxic-ischemia (HI) in the neonatal brain via insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)/Akt pathway-mediated downregulation of p53 in the neurovascular unit. On postnatal (P) day 7, HI was induced in rat pups grouped from P1 into normal litter size (NL, 12 pups/dam) and increased litter size (<el> DR <le>, 18 pups/dam). In vivo IRS-1 anti-sense oligonucleotide and IRS-1 overexpressed recombinant adenovirus were given, and neurovascular damage was assessed. In vitro models of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) examined the inhibition and overexpression of IRS-1 on p53 and cell death in neurons and endothelial cells. Compared to NL pups, <el> DR <le> pups had significantly higher IRS-1, p-IRS-1, and pAkt levels, decreased p53, more tight junction proteins, reduced blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage after HI, and less infarct volumes at P21. Immunofluorescence revealed that IRS-1 was upregulated in the endothelial cells and neurons of <el> DR <le> pups. IRS-1 downregulation in <el> DR <le> pups reduced p-Akt, increased p53, worsened BBB damage, and increased <re> brain injury <er>, whereas IRS-1 overexpression in NL pups upregulated p-Akt, decreased p53, attenuated BBB damage, and decreased <re> brain injury <er>. In vitro, IRS-1 downregulation aggravated cell death in neurons and endothelial cells and is associated with decreased p-Akt and increased p53. In contrast, IRS-1 overexpression reduced cell death in endothelial cells with increased p-Akt and decreased p53. 
Anoectochilus formosanus is used in traditional folk medicine as an hepatoprotective agent. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a standardized aqueous extract of A. formosanus (SAEAF) on thioacetamide (<el> TAA <le>)-induced liver <re> fibrosis <er>. An in vitro study showed that the inhibitive effect of kinsenoside, a major component of SAEAF, on tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion from Kupffer cells might be derived at least partly from downregulation of LPS-receptor Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling. Hepatic <re> fibrosis <er> was produced by <el> TAA <le> (200 mg/kg, i.p.) 3 times per week for 12 weeks. Mice in the three <el> TAA <le> groups were treated daily with distilled water and SAEAF (1.0, 0.2 g/kg) via gastrogavage throughout the experimental period. The mice that received the SAEAF treatment had significantly reduced plasma alanine aminotransferase activity, relative liver weights, and hepatic hydroxyproline contents. A histological examination also confirmed that SAEAF reduced the degree of <re> fibrosis <er> caused by <el> TAA <le> treatment. RT-PCR analysis showed that SAEAF treatment reduced mRNA expression of collagen (alpha1)(I), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, CD14, TLR4, and TNF receptor 1. An immunohistochemical examination also indicated that SAEAF reduced the number of CD68-positive cells (macrophages). 
We determined the contributions of various endothelium-derived relaxing factors to control of basal vascular tone and endothelium-dependent <re> vasodilation <er> in the mouse hindlimb in vivo. Under anesthesia, catheters were placed in a carotid artery, jugular vein, and femoral artery (for local hindlimb circulation injections). Hindlimb blood flow (HBF) was measured by transit-time ultrasound flowmetry. N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 50 mg/kg plus 10 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1)), to block nitric oxide (NO) production, altered basal hemodynamics, increasing mean arterial pressure (30 +/- 3%) and reducing HBF (-30 +/- 12%). Basal hemodynamics were not significantly altered by indomethacin (10 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1)), charybdotoxin (ChTx, 3 x 10(-8) mol/l), apamin (2.5 x 10(-7) mol/l), or ChTx plus apamin (to block endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor; <el> EDHF <le>). Hyperemic responses to local injection of acetylcholine (2.4 microg/kg) were reproducible in vehicle-treated mice and were not significantly attenuated by L-NAME alone, indomethacin alone, L-NAME plus indomethacin with or without co-infusion of diethlyamine NONOate to restore resting NO levels, ChTx alone, or apamin alone. Hyperemic responses evoked by acetylcholine were reduced by 29 +/- 11% after combined treatment with apamin plus charybdotoxin, and the remainder was virtually abolished by additional treatment with L-NAME but not indomethacin. None of the treatments altered the hyperemic response to sodium nitroprusside (5 microg/kg). 
Impaired trophoblast <re> invasion <er> is associated with pregnancy disorders such as early pregnancy loss and preeclampsia. There is evidence to suggest that the consumption of caffeine during pregnancy may increase the risk of pregnancy loss; however, little is known about the direct effect of caffeine on normal trophoblast biology. Our objectives were to examine the effect of caffeine on trophoblast migration and motility after stimulation with epidermal growth factor (<el> EGF <le>) and to investigate the intracellular signaling pathways involved in this process. Primary first-trimester extravillous trophoblasts (EVT) and the EVT-derived cell line SGHPL-4 were used to study the effect of caffeine on <el> EGF <le>-stimulated cellular motility using time-lapse microscopy. SGHPL-4 cells were further used to study the effect of caffeine and cAMP on <el> EGF <le>-stimulated <re> invasion <er> of fibrin gels. The influence of caffeine and cAMP on <el> EGF <le>-stimulated intracellular signaling pathways leading to the activation of Akt were investigated by Western blot analysis. Caffeine inhibits both <el> EGF <le>-stimulated primary EVT and SGHPL-4 cell motility. <el> EGF <le> stimulation activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Akt and caffeine inhibit this activation. Although cAMP inhibits both motility and <re> invasion <er>, it does not inhibit the activation of Akt, indicating that the effects of caffeine seen in this study are independent of cAMP. Further investigation indicated a role for mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) as a target for the inhibitory effect of caffeine. 
MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) are dual specificity phosphatases that dephosphorylate and thereby inactivate MAPKs. In the present study, we provide evidence that platelet-derived growth factor BB (<el> PDGF <le>-BB) regulates MKP3 (DUSP6), which is considered to be a phosphatase highly selective for Erk. Intriguingly, we observed that Mek is positively regulated by MKP3, whereas Erk itself is negatively regulated. In addition, we found that activation of <el> PDGF <le> receptor alpha or beta leads to a rapid proteasomal degradation of MKP3 in a manner that requires Mek activation; this feed-forward mechanism was found to be essential for efficient <re> Erk phosphorylation <er>. We could also demonstrate that <el> PDGF <le>-BB stimulation induces phosphorylation of MKP3 at Ser-174 and Ser-300; phosphorylation of Ser-174 is involved in <el> PDGF <le>-induced MKP3 degradation, since mutation of this site stabilized MKP3. Moreover, activated Erk induces mkp3 expression, leading to restoration of MKP3 levels after 1-2 h and a concomitant dephosphorylation of Erk in cells with activated <el> PDGF <le>Ralpha. Reducing the MKP3 level by small interfering RNA leads to an increased Erk activation and mitogenic response to <el> PDGF <le>-BB. 
Arterioles display cyclic variations in diameter, termed <re> vasomotion <er> initiated by smooth muscle cells (SMCs), but the endothelium should also be evaluated due to its modulatory role on vessel tone. Since nitric oxide (<el> NO <le>) and prostacyclin (PGI2) regulate SMC tone and activate K(+) currents, we have investigated their role on <re> vasomotion <er>, by observing effects of topical application of N(ω)-nitro-l-arginine (L-NA, <el> NO <le> synthesis inhibitor), glibenclamide (KATP channel inhibitor), sodium nitroprusside (SNP, <el> NO <le> donor), iloprost (PGI2 analogue) and methylene blue (MB, cGMP production inhibitor) on the cheek pouch preparation of anesthetized male hamsters. L-NA (10(-10)-10(-6)M) induced vasoconstriction, reduction and abolition of <re> vasomotion <er>. MB (10(-7) to 10(-5)M) reduced mean arteriolar diameter with no changes on <re> vasomotion <er>. In the presence of 10(-6)M of MB, addition of 10(-6)L-NA totally abolished <re> vasomotion <er> without further constriction. Glibenclamide (10(-6)M) in the presence of L-NA at equimolar concentration restored both <re> vasomotion <er> frequency and amplitude. This effect was not observed in the presence of TEA 5mM. SNP (10(-10)-10(-6)M) induced a dose-dependent increase of arteriolar diameter and decreased <re> vasomotion <er>. Iloprost (10(-12)-10(-6)M) induced a concentration dependent increase of arteriolar diameter, reduced <re> vasomotion <er> frequency, but in lower concentrations (10(-12)-10(-10)M) increased its amplitude and in higher concentrations (10(-9)-10(-6)M) decreased it. SNP and iloprost inhibited <re> vasomotion <er> at 10(-7)M; however, at this concentration SNP and iloprost induced an increment of 35% and 50% of the initial arteriolar diameter, respectively. In the presence of L-NA (10(-6)M), <re> vasomotion <er> was restored by SNP at 10(-10)M and iloprost 10(-12)M, which corresponded to 80% of the initial diameter value. Around the initial (control) arteriolar diameter value, <re> vasomotion <er> presented its highest frequencies and amplitudes. Cessation of <re> vasomotion <er> occurred with L-NA (10(-6)M) in the presence of SNP (10(-6)M) and iloprost (10(-7)M) when arteriolar diameter reached 150% and 120% of its initial value, respectively. 
Mechanisms of antibiotic resistance were examined in nalidixic acid-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis field isolates displaying decreased susceptibility to <re> ciprofloxacin <er> and in in vitro-derived <re> ciprofloxacin <er>-resistant mutants (104-cip and 5408-cip). All field isolates harbored a single <el> gyrA mutation <le> (D87Y). Deletion of acrB and complementation with wild-type gyrA increased quinolone susceptibility. Selection for <re> ciprofloxacin <er> resistance was associated with the development of an additional gyrA (S83F) mutation in 104-cip, novel gyrB (E466D) and parE (V461G) mutations in 5408-cip, overexpression of acrB and decreased susceptibility to nonquinolone antibiotics in both mutants, and decreased OmpF production and altered lipopolysaccharide in 104-cip. Complementation of mutated gyrA and gyrB with wild-type alleles restored susceptibility to quinolones in 104-cip and significantly decreased the <re> ciprofloxacin <er> MIC in 5408-cip. Complementation of parE had no effect on quinolone MICs. Deletion of acrB restored susceptibility to <re> ciprofloxacin <er> and other antibiotics tested. Both soxS and marA were overexpressed in 104-cip, and ramA was overexpressed in 5408-cip. Inactivation of each of these global regulators lowered <re> ciprofloxacin <er> MICs, decreased expression of acrB, and restored susceptibility to other antibiotics. Mutations were found in soxR (R20H) and in soxS (E52K) in 104-cip and in ramR (G25A) in 5408-cip. 
Adiponectin is an adipokine with profound <el> insulin <le>-sensitizing, anti-inflammatory, and anti-atherogenic properties. Plasma levels of adiponectin are reduced in <el> insulin <le> resistant states such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. However, the mechanism(s) by which adiponectin concentrations are decreased during disease development is unclear. Studies have shown that endothelin-1 (ET-1), a vasoconstrictor peptide, affects adipocyte glucose metabolism and secretion of adipokines such as leptin, resistin, and adiponectin. The goal of our study was to determine the mechanism by which ET-1 decreases <re> adiponectin secretion <er>. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated for 24h with ET-1 (10nM) and then stimulated with vehicle or <el> insulin <le> (100 nM) for a period of 1-2h. Chronic ET-1 (24h) treatment significantly decreased basal and <el> insulin <le>-stimulated <re> adiponectin secretion <er> by 66% and 47%, respectively. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) hydrolysis by the PLCbeta inhibitor, U73122, or exogenous addition of PIP(2):histone carrier complex (1.25:0.625 microM) ameliorated the decrease in basal and <el> insulin <le>-stimulated <re> adiponectin secretion <er> observed with ET-1. However, treatment with exogenous PIP(2):histone carrier complex and the actin depolymerizing agent latrunculin B (20 microM) did not reverse the ET-1-mediated decrease in <re> adiponectin secretion <er>. 
Using ex vivo perfused intestinal loop from vitamin D-deficient rats, we studied the lumen-to-vein <re> transport <er> of 32Pi in intestines perfused intraluminally with [gamma-32P] ATP, [alpha-32P] ATP or 32Pi, and infused through their vascular connections with either 1,25(<el> OH <le>)2D3 (6nM) or ethanol vehicle. For intestines perfused with [gamma-32P] ATP in which the gamma-32P is easily liberated by alkaline phosphatase, 1,25(<el> OH <le>)2D3 infusion resulted in a significant and early (15 min) increase in net lumen-to-vein 32Pi <re> transport <er>. Pretreatment of rats with levamisole, an inhibitor of alkaline phosphatase, partially inhibited such 32Pi <re> transport <er>. For intestines infused with [alpha-32P] ATP, the lumen-to-vein <re> transport <er> of 32Pi did not differ in 1,25(<el> OH <le>)2D3-treated and in control intestines. For intestines perfused with 32Pi, 1,25(<el> OH <le>)2D3 infusion resulted in an early (15 min) increase in lumen-to-vein <re> transport <er> of 32Pi. 
Cortactin is an F-actin binding protein that stabilizes F-actin networks and promotes actin polymerization by activating the Arp2/3 complex. Overexpression of <el> cortactin <le>, as observed in several human cancers, stimulates <re> cell migration <er>, invasion, and experimental metastasis; however, the underlying mechanism is not understood. To investigate the importance of <el> cortactin <le> in <re> cell migration <er>, we downregulated its expression using RNA interference (RNAi). Stable downregulation of <el> cortactin <le> in HBL100 breast epithelial cells resulted in (i) decreased <re> cell migration <er> and invasion, (ii) enhanced cell-cell adhesion, and (iii) accelerated cell spreading. These phenotypic changes were reversed by expression of RNAi-resistant mouse <el> cortactin <le>. Cortactin colocalized with cadherin and beta-catenin in adherens junctions, consistent with its role in intercellular adhesion. Remarkably, <el> cortactin <le> deficiency did not affect lamellipodia formation. Instead, downregulation of <el> cortactin <le> in human squamous carcinoma cells that overexpress <el> cortactin <le> changed the cytoskeletal organization. 
Racemic <el> gossypol <le> is an effective male antifertility agent in several mammalian species. However, (+)-<el> gossypol <le> is not an effective male antifertility agent in the rat or the hamster. Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of racemic <el> gossypol <le> to inhibit the testis-specific <re> LDH-X <er> enzyme derived from various mammalian species and have suggested <re> LDH-X <er> as the potential site of <el> gossypol <le> antifertility action. In the present study, the effects of racemic <el> gossypol <le> and the (+) and (-) optical isomers of <el> gossypol <le> on <re> LDH-X <er> derived from rat and hamster testicular cytosol are compared to determine if there is any correlation between the in vitro inhibition of the <re> LDH-X <er> enzyme and in vivo antifertility effects. Both optical isomers of <el> gossypol <le> as well as racemic <el> gossypol <le> inhibit rat and hamster testicular cytosolic <re> LDH-X <er> activity. Inhibition of hamster testicular cytosolic <re> LDH-X <er> activity by (-)-<el> gossypol <le> was less than by either racemic <el> gossypol <le> or (+)-<el> gossypol <le>. 
Cyclic nucleotides play an important role in the regulation of fibroblast proliferation and collagen metabolism. In the present study, the antifibrotic potential of dibutyrylcAMP (Bt2cAMP) was evaluated in the bleomycin (<el> BLM <le>)-hamster model of <re> pulmonary fibrosis <er>. Bt2cAMP (10 mg kg-1, s.c.) or saline (SA, s.c.) was given daily two days prior to the first intratracheal (i.t.) dose of <el> BLM <le> or SA and thereafter throughout the study. <el> BLM <le> or SA was instilled i.t. in three consecutive doses (2.5, 2.0 and 1.5 U 5ml-1 kg-1) at weekly intervals. Hamsters were killed at 7, 14 and 20 days after the third i.t. instillation. Bt2cAMP significantly reduced the contents of lung hydroxyproline and lung thiobarbituric acid reactive substance equivalents in <el> BLM <le>-treated animals at 7 and 14 days. Bt2cAMP significantly elevated lung superoxide dismutase activity in <el> BLM <le>-treated animals at 7 days. Lung prolyl hydroxylase activity was significantly elevated at 14 and 20 days in SABLM- and Bt2cAMPBLM-treated animals. The ratio of cAMP/cGMP was significantly reduced at all time points in SABLM-treated animals but only at 7 and 14 days in Bt2cAMPBLM-treated animals. Bt2cAMP caused no significant changes in lung calcium and calmodulin levels and protein content of the bronchoalveolar lavage. <el> BLM <le> significantly increased various inflammatory cell counts in the lavage at all three time points. The cell counts in the Bt2cAMPBLM groups were generally lower at 7 days and higher at 20 days than those of the SABLM groups. Histological evaluation showed that the lungs of Bt2cAMPBLM-treated hamsters progressed from an inflammatory cell lesion to a fibrotic lesion at a slower rate than the SABLM groups. 
Laryngopharyngeal or gastroesophageal reflux is associated with laryngeal airway hyperreactivity (<re> LAH <er>), but neither the cause-effect relationship nor the underlying mechanism has been elucidated. Here we established a rat model with enhanced laryngeal reflex reactivity induced by laryngeal acid-pepsin insult and investigated the neural and hydroxyl radical (*<el> OH <le>) mechanisms involved. The laryngeal segments of 103 anesthetized rats were functionally isolated while animals breathed spontaneously. Ammonia vapor was delivered into the laryngeal segment to measure laryngeal reflex reactivity. We found that the laryngeal pH 5-pepsin treatment doubled the reflex apneic response to ammonia, whereas laryngeal pH 7.4-pepsin, pH 2-pepsin, and pH 5-denatured pepsin treatment had no effect. Histological examination revealed limited laryngeal inflammation and epithelial damage after pH 5-pepsin treatment and more severe damage after pH 2-pepsin treatment. In rats that had received the laryngeal pH 5-pepsin treatment, the apneic response to ammonia was abolished by either denervation or perineural capsaicin treatment (PCT; a procedure that selectively blocks capsaicin-sensitive afferent fibers) of the superior laryngeal nerves, but was unaffected by perineural sham treatment. <re> LAH <er> was prevented by laryngeal application of either dimethylthiourea (DMTU; a *<el> OH <le> scavenger) or deferoxamine (DEF; an antioxidant for *<el> OH <le>), but was unaltered by the DMTU vehicle or iron-saturated DEF (ineffective DEF). <re> LAH <er> reappeared after recovery from PCT, DMTU, or DEF treatment. 
We studied cerebral pressure autoregulation and <el> carbon dioxide <le> reactivity during propofol-induced electrical silence of the electroencephalogram (<re> EEG <er>) in 10 patients. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol 2.5 mg kg-1, fentanyl 3 micrograms kg-1 and vecuronium 0.1 mg kg-1, and a propofol infusion of 250-300 micrograms kg-1 min-1 was used to induce <re> EEG <er> silence. Cerebral pressure autoregulation was tested by increasing mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 24 (SEM 5) mm Hg from baseline with an infusion of phenylephrine and simultaneously recording middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (vmca) using transcranial Doppler. Carbon dioxide reactivity was tested by varying PaCO2 between 4.0 and 7.0 kPa and recording vmca simultaneously. Although absolute <el> carbon dioxide <le> reactivity was reduced, relative <el> carbon dioxide <le> reactivity was within normal limits for all patients studied (mean 8.5 (SEM 0.8) cm s-1 kPa-1 and 22 (2)% kPa-1, respectively). No significant change in vmca (34 (2) and 35 (2) cm s-1) was observed with the increase in MAP (77 (4) to 101 (4) mm Hg) during autoregulation testing. 
Glomerular mesangial cells contain actin and myosin, and in analogy to vascular smooth muscle cells, they can contract and relax to regulate the glomerular filtration rate. A key molecule that determines hemodynamic properties is <el> nitric oxide <le>, which is produced by <el> nitric oxide <le> synthase isoenzymes located in individual cells of the kidney. The contractility of mesangial cells is based on the interaction of actin microfilament bundles (F-actin) with myosin. We had the notion that <el> nitric oxide <le> influences the shape change of mesangial cells, so we analyzed the signal transduction involved. Chemically unrelated <el> nitric oxide <le> donors induced F-actin dissolution, which was mediated by cGMP but was unrelated to protein kinase G activation. Actin disassembly was achieved with inhibitors of phosphodiesterase-3 and -4 or forskolin-evoked <re> cAMP <er> generation. We assumed that signal transmission involves activation of protein kinase A, and we went on to attenuate F-actin disassembly by protein kinase A inhibition. 
Escherichia coli hemolysin has been implicated as a pathogenicity factor in extraintestinal E. coli infections including sepsis. In the present study the effects of intravascular administration of hemolysin were investigated in isolated blood-free perfused rabbit lungs. Low concentrations of the toxin in the perfusate (0.05-5 hemolytic units/ml, corresponding to approximately 5-500 ng/ml), caused a dose- and time-dependent release of potassium, <el> thromboxane <le> A2, and prostaglandin I2, but not of lactate dehydrogenase, into the recirculating medium, as well as a dose-dependent liberation of the prostanoids into the bronchoalveolar space. These events were paralleled by a dose-dependent <re> pulmonary hypertension <er>, and studies with different inhibitors collectively indicated that the vasoconstrictor response was mediated predominantly by pulmonary <el> thromboxane <le> generation. In addition, E. coli hemolysin elicited a protracted, dose-dependent increase in the lung capillary filtration coefficient, which was independent of the prostanoid-mediated pressor response and resulted in severe pulmonary edema formation. 
Down syndrome (DS) is a chromosomal disorder caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 (Ts21). Unbalanced karyotypes can lead to dysfunction of the proteostasis network (PN) and disrupted proteostasis is mechanistically associated with multiple DS comorbidities. Autophagy is a critical component of the PN that has not previously been investigated in DS. Based on our previous observations of PN disruption in DS, we investigated possible dysfunction of the autophagic machinery in human DS fibroblasts and other DS cell models. Following induction of autophagy by serum starvation, DS fibroblasts displayed impaired autophagic flux indicated by autophagolysosome accumulation and elevated <re> p62 <er>, NBR1, and LC3-II abundance, compared to age- and sex-matched, euploid (CTL) fibroblasts. While lysosomal physiology was unaffected in both groups after serum starvation, we observed decreased basal abundance of the Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor Attachment protein Receptor (SNARE) family members syntaxin 17 (STX17) and Vesicle Associated Membrane Protein 8 (<el> VAMP8 <le>) indicating that decreased autophagic flux in DS is due at least in part to a possible impairment of autophagosome-lysosome fusion. 
1. Coordinated oscillations in diameter occur spontaneously in cerebral vessels and depend on the opening of voltage dependent calcium channels. However, the mechanism that induces the initial depolarisation has remained elusive. We investigated the involvement of canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels, which encode nonselective <el> cation channels <le> passing Na(+) and Ca(2+) currents, by measuring changes in diameter, intracellular Ca(2+) and membrane potential in branches of juvenile rat basilar arteries. 2. Removal of extracellular Ca(2+) abolished <re> vasomotion <er> and relaxed arteries, but paradoxically produced depolarisation. 3. Decrease in temperature to 24 degrees C or inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) abolished <re> vasomotion <er>, hyperpolarised and relaxed arteries and decreased intracellular Ca(2+). 4. Reduction in the driving force for Na(+) through decrease in extracellular Na(+) produced similar effects and prevented the depolarisation elicited by removal of extracellular Ca(2+). 5. Nonselective TRP channel blockers, SKF96365 and gadolinium, mimicked the effects of inhibition of the PLC pathway. 6. Depolarisation of vessels in which TRP channels were blocked with SKF96365 reinstated vascular tone and <re> vasomotion <er>. 7. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed TRPC1 as the predominantly expressed TRPC subtype. 8. Incubation with a function blocking TRPC1 antibody delayed the onset of <re> vasomotion <er>. 9. 
1. A non-invasive technique for the scintigraphic determination of 111indium-labelled <re> platelet aggregation <er> stimulated with submaximal doses of adenosine diphosphate (ADP, 56 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), collagen (100 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), platelet-activating factor (PAF, 0.1 microgram kg-1 i.v.) or thrombin (18 iu kg-1 i.v.) was used to investigate the platelet-inhibitory effects of endothelin 1 (<el> ET-1 <le>) in anaesthetized rabbits in vivo. 2. <el> ET-1 <le> (1 nmol kg-1 i.v.) inhibited ADP-stimulated <re> platelet aggregation <er> in vivo; a maximum inhibition of 78% of the control value was reached at 3 min, with 45% inhibition at 15 min, and a return to control values at 30 min after injection of the peptide. 3. <el> ET-1 <le> (1 nmol kg-1 i.v.) inhibited in vivo <re> platelet aggregation <er> in response to collagen or PAF by 86% and 52%, respectively, but had no effect on thrombin-induced <re> platelet aggregation <er>. 4. Indomethacin (5 mg kg-1 i.v.) abolished the <el> ET-1 <le>-induced inhibition of ADP-stimulated <re> platelet aggregation <er> and significantly potentiated and prolonged the pressor response brought about by <el> ET-1 <le>. 5. 
The main results of the Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive DruG Evaluation (COURAGE) trial revealed no significant differences in the primary end point of all-cause mortality or nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI] or major secondary end points (composites of <re> death <er>/MI/stroke; hospitalization for acute coronary syndromes [ACSs]) during a median 4.6-year follow-up in 2,287 patients with stable coronary artery disease randomized to optimal medical therapy (OMT) with or without percutaneous coronary intervention (<el> PCI <le>). We sought to assess the impact of <el> PCI <le> when added to OMT on major prespecified tertiary cardiovascular outcomes (time to first event), namely cardiac <re> death <er> and composites of cardiac <re> death <er>/MI, cardiac <re> death <er>/MI/hospitalization for ACS, cardiac <re> death <er>/MI/stroke, MI/stroke, or cardiac <re> death <er>/MI/ACS/stroke, during study follow-up. There were no significant differences between treatment arms for the composite of cardiac <re> death <er> or MI (15% in <el> PCI <le> + OMT group vs 14.2% in OMT group, hazard ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 1.33, p = 0.62) or in any of the major prespecified composite cardiovascular events during long-term follow-up, even after excluding periprocedural MI as an outcome of interest. Overall, cause-specific cardiovascular outcomes paralleled closely the primary and secondary composite outcomes of the trial as a whole. 
Agrin induces both phosphorylation and aggregation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) when added to myotubes in culture, apparently by binding to a specific receptor on the myotube surface. One such <el> agrin <le> receptor is alpha-dystroglycan, although binding to alpha-dystroglycan appears not to mediate AChR aggregation. To determine whether <el> agrin <le>-induced <re> AChR phosphorylation <er> is mediated by alpha-dystroglycan or by a different <el> agrin <le> receptor, fragments of recombinant <el> agrin <le> that differ in affinity for alpha-dystroglycan were examined for their ability to induce <re> AChR phosphorylation <er> and aggregation in mouse C2 myotubes. The carboxy-terminal 95 kDa <el> agrin <le> fragment <el> agrin <le>-c95(A0B0), which binds to alpha-dystroglycan with high affinity, failed to induce <re> AChR phosphorylation <er> and aggregation. In contrast, <el> agrin <le>-c95(A4B8) which binds less strongly to alpha-dystroglycan, induced both phosphorylation and aggregation, as did a small 21 kDa fragment of <el> agrin <le>, <el> agrin <le>-c21(B8), that completely lacks the binding domain for alpha-dystroglycan. 
The <el> insulin <le>-like growth factor, multiplication stimulating activity (MSA), and <el> insulin <le> were recently shown to stimulate proteoglycan synthesis in monolayer cultures of chondrocytes derived from the Swarm rat <re> chondrosarcoma <er>. Insulin produced significant stimulation at a concentration of less than 1 ng/ml, suggesting that <el> insulin <le> was acting through the <el> insulin <le> receptor rather than through a somatomedin receptor. In this paper we have shown that the <el> insulin <le>-like growth factors IGF-I and IGF-II also are potent stimulators of [35S]sulfate incorporation into macromolecules recovered from the medium and cell layer matrix of the <re> chondrosarcoma <er> chondrocytes. Proinsulin was 3% as potent as <el> insulin <le> in stimulating [35S]sulfate incorporation. We identified receptors for <el> insulin <le> and the <el> insulin <le>-like growth factors, MSA, IGF-I, and IGF-II. Insulin, at concentrations 1000 times the concentration required to produce the biologic response, did not compete for binding of 125I-MSA-II-1 or of 125I-IGF-II and only partially competed for 125I-IGF-I binding. Anti-<el> insulin <le> receptor IgG stimulated proteoglycan synthesis and competed for 125I-<el> insulin <le> binding. Fab fragment prepared from anti-<el> insulin <le> receptor IgG completely blocked the stimulation of [35S]sulfate incorporation into macromolecules by <el> insulin <le> while only partially inhibiting the biologic response to <el> insulin <le>-like growth factors, MSA, IGF-I, and IGF-II. Similarly, the anti-<el> insulin <le> receptor IgG only partially inhibited the binding of 125I-IGF-I and 125I-IGF-II while completely blocking the binding of 125I-<el> insulin <le>. 
A bioassay of technical-grade <el> toxaphene <le> for possible carcinogenicity was conducted by administering the test chemical in feed to Osborne-Mendel rats and B6C3F1 mice. Groups of 50 rats of each sex were administered <el> toxaphene <le> at one of two doses for 80 weeks, then observed for 28 or 30 weeks. Time-weighted average doses for males were 556 or 1,112 ppm; for females they were 540 or 1,080 ppm. Matched controls consisted of groups of 10 untreated rats of each sex; pooled controls consisted of the matched-control groups for <el> toxaphene <le> combined with 45 untreated male and 45 untreated female rats from similar bioassays of five other test chemicals. All surviving rats were killed at 108-110 weeks. Groups of 50 mice of each sex were administered <el> toxaphene <le> at one of two doses for 80 weeks, then observed for 10 or 11 weeks. Time-weighted average doses were 99 or 198 ppm for both males and females. Matched controls consisted of groups of 10 untreated mice of each sex; pooled controls consisted of the matched-control groups for <el> toxaphene <le> combined with 40 untreated male and 40 untreated female mice from similar bioassays of four other test chemicals. All surviving mice were killed at 90-91 weeks. Mean body weights attained by low- and high-dose female rats and high-dose male mice were lower than those of matched controls, but weights of other dosed groups were essentially unaffected by the <el> toxaphene <le>. Other clinical signs of toxicity in rats included generalized body tremors at week 53 in high-dose male and female animals, and later, leg paralysis, ataxia, epistaxis, hematuria, and vaginal bleeding, predominantly in the dosed groups of rats of each sex. Abdominal distention, diarrhea, dyspnea, and rough hair coats were common to both dosed rats and dosed mice. There were dose-related decreases in survival rates in mice but not in rats. Sufficient numbers of both rats and mice were at risk for the development of late-appearing tumors. In the male rats, the incidence of follicular-cell carcinomas or adenomas of the thyroid was dose related (P=0.007) using the pooled controls (matched controls 1/7, pooled controls 2/44, low-dose 7/41, high-dose 9/35). In the females, the incidence of follicular-cell adenomas of the thyroid was dose related using either the matched (P=0.022) or pooled (P=0.008) controls (matched controls 0/6, pooled controls 1/46, low-dose 1/43, high-dose 7/42). Direct comparisons of dosed and pooled-control groups but not matched controls showed significantly increased incidences of follicular-cell carcinomas or adenomas in the high-dose males (P=0.008) and of follicular-cell adenomas in the high-dose females (P=0.021). Two follicular-cell tumors in the high-dose males were carcinomas; all other follicular-cell tumors in the rats were adenomas. In the mice, the incidence of <re> hepatocellular carcinomas <er> was dose related (P<0.001) for both males (matched controls 0/10, pooled controls 4/48, low-dose 34/49, high-dose 45/46) and females (matched controls 0/9, pooled controls 0/48, low-dose 5/49, high-dose 34/49), using either matched or pooled controls. Direct comparisons showed that the incidences of <re> hepatocellular carcinomas <er> in low- and high-dose male mice and high-dose female mice were all significantly higher (P<0.001) than those in the respective matched or pooled controls. Statistical significance was maintained when the incidence of <re> hepatocellular carcinomas <er> was combined with that of neoplastic nodules of the liver. 
RANTES is a key chemokine for atherosclerosis, and obesity is associated with progression of atherosclerosis. Substance P (SP) increases glucose uptake and accumulation of lipids in adipocytes, and SP may upregulate RANTES expression. This study investigated the mechanism of RANTES expression by human M1 macrophages stimulated with SP. SP upregulated RANTES protein expression, whereas aprepitant (an NK1R antagonist) blunted this response. Pretreatment of macrophages with BIRB796 (a combined p38γ/p38δ inhibitor) led to a significant decrease of RANTES expression. Next, we investigated the effect of several NK1R internalization factors on RANTES expression, including GRK2, β-arrestin 2, dynamin, ROCK, and <re> TGFβ <er>1. Exposure of macrophages to SP upregulated <re> TGFβ <er>1 expression. Silencing of β-arrestin 2 or GRK2 significantly enhanced the RANTES protein level after stimulation by SP, whereas <re> TGFβ <er>1/2/3 siRNA or dynasore (a dynamin inhibitor) decreased RANTES and Y-27632 (a ROCK inhibitor) had no effect. Surprisingly, silencing of transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1) or inhibition of Sp1 activity by mithramycin led to significant upregulation of <re> TGFβ <er>1 protein and corresponding enhancement of RANTES expression (by ELISA or western blotting), whereas siRNA for <el> C/EBPβ <le> attenuated expression of both <re> TGFβ <er>1 and RANTES. Next, we investigated transcriptional cross-talk among Sp1 and <el> C/EBPβ <le>, TIF1β, or Fli-1 in relation to RANTES expression. Compared with TIF1β or Fli-1 siRNA, <el> C/EBPβ <le> siRNA showed significantly stronger inhibition of RANTES production by Sp1 siRNA-transfected macrophages after stimulation with SP. In conclusion, transcription factor Sp1 engages in cross-talk with <el> C/EBPβ <le> and modulates <re> TGFβ <er>1 production to negatively regulate RANTES expression in macrophages stimulated with SP. 
Proper neuronal function requires essential biological cargoes to be packaged within membranous vesicles and transported, intracellularly, through the extensive outgrowth of axonal and dendritic fibers. The precise spatiotemporal movement of these cargoes is vital for neuronal survival and, thus, is highly regulated. In this study we test how the axonal movement of a neuropeptide-containing dense-core vesicle (DCV) responds to alcohol stressors. We found that <re> ethanol <er> induces a strong anterograde bias in vesicle movement. Low doses of <re> ethanol <er> stimulate the anterograde movement of neuropeptide-DCV while high doses inhibit bi-directional movement. This process required the presence of functional kinesin-1 motors as reduction in kinesin prevented the <re> ethanol <er>-induced stimulation of the anterograde movement of neuropeptide-DCV. Furthermore, expression of inactive glycogen synthase kinase 3 (<el> GSK-3β <le>) also prevented <re> ethanol <er>-induced stimulation of neuropeptide-DCV movement, similar to pharmacological inhibition of <el> GSK-3β <le> with lithium. Conversely, inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling with wortmannin led to a partial prevention of <re> ethanol <er>-stimulated transport of neuropeptide-DCV. 
Aripiprazole is an antipsychotic that acts as a partial agonist at dopamine receptors. As the effects of most drugs of abuse converge to enhance dopamine-mediated neurotransmission, the present study was designed to test the hypothesis that <el> aripiprazole <le> would inhibit the acute effects of ethanol, a widely abused substance. Male Swiss mice received acute injections and were evaluated for motor activity in three distinct tests. In the open field, ethanol (1.5, 2.5 and 3.5 g/kg) induced an increase in <re> locomotion <er> in a U-shaped dose-related fashion, whereas <el> aripiprazole <le> (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg) did not affect this parameter. All the doses of the antipsychotic were able to prevent the stimulant effects of 2.5 g/kg of ethanol. In the rotarod test, ethanol (2.5 and 3.5 g/kg) reduced the latency to fall from the apparatus, an effect also observed with the higher dose of <el> aripiprazole <le>. Contrary to what was observed in the open field, this antipsychotic did not interfere with the effects of ethanol in motor balance. Finally, we tested animals in the wire hang test, in which ethanol, but not <el> aripiprazole <le>, reduced latency to fall at all doses. In this test, <el> aripiprazole <le> did not change ethanol effects. 
Amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) and sortilin were reported to individually bind the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (<el> PCSK9 <le>) and regulate its activity on the low-density lipoprotein receptor (<re> LDLR <er>). The data presented herein demonstrate that mRNA knockdowns of APLP2, sortilin, or both in the human hepatocyte cell lines HepG2 and Huh7 do not affect the ability of extracellular <el> PCSK9 <le> to enhance the degradation of the <re> LDLR <er>. Furthermore, mice deficient in APLP2 or sortilin do not exhibit significant changes in liver <re> LDLR <er> or plasma total cholesterol levels. Moreover, cellular overexpression of one or both proteins does not alter <el> PCSK9 <le> secretion, or its activity on the <re> LDLR <er>. 
The extent to which abnormal endothelium-dependent vasodilator mechanisms contribute to abnormal resting vasoconstriction and blunted reflex <re> vasodilation <er> seen in heart failure is unknown. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the resting and reflex abnormalities in vascular tone that characterize heart failure are mediated by abnormal endothelium-mediated mechanisms. Thirteen advanced heart-failure patients (New York Heart Association III-IV) and 13 age-matched normal controls were studied. Saline, acetylcholine (20 microg/min), or L-arginine (10 mg/min) was infused into the brachial artery, and forearm blood flow was measured by venous plethysmography at rest and during mental stress. At rest, acetylcholine decreased forearm vascular resistance in normal subjects, but this response was blunted in heart failure. During mental stress with intra-arterial acetylcholine or L-arginine, the decrease in forearm vascular resistance was not greater than during saline control in heart failure [saline control vs. acetylcholine (7 +/- 3 vs. 6 +/- 3, P = NS) or vs. L-arginine (9 +/- 2 units, P = NS)]. The increase in forearm blood flow was not greater than during saline control in heart failure [saline control vs. acetylcholine (1. 2 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.3, P = NS), or vs. L-arginine (1.2 +/- 0.2 ml x min(-1) x 100 ml(-1), P = NS)]. Furthermore, during mental stress with <el> nitroprusside <le>, the decrease in forearm vascular resistance was not greater than during saline control [saline control vs. <el> nitroprusside <le> (7 +/- 3 vs. 5 +/- 4 ml x min(-1) x 100 g(-1), P = NS)], and the increase in forearm blood flow was not greater than during saline control [saline control vs. <el> nitroprusside <le> (1.2 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.5 ml x min(-1) x 100 g(-1), P = NS)]. 
Previously, we observed that hypoxia increases the expression of the β1-subunit (KCNMB1) of the calcium-sensitive potassium channel (BK(Ca)). Herein, we elucidate the mechanism whereby hypoxia increases <re> KCNMB1 expression <er> in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (<el> hPASMC <le>). In response to hypoxia, the expression of both the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF-1α) and KCNMB1 are increased. Knockdown of HIF-1α using a shRNA plasmid blocked the hypoxic induction of <re> KCNMB1 expression <er>. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) demonstrated HIF-1α binding to three discrete regions of the human KCNMB1 promoter known to contain hypoxia response elements (HREs). A KCNMB1 promoter reporter assay combined with site-directed mutagenesis identified two adjacent HREs located between -3,540 bp and -3,311 bp that are essential for the hypoxic induction of KCNMB1 promoter activity. Furthermore, additional ChIP assays demonstrated recruitment of the HIF-1α transcriptional coactivator, p300, to this same promoter region. Treatment of <el> hPASMC <le> with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin, prolonged the increase in KCNMB1 observed with hypoxia, suggesting that alterations in chromatin remodeling function to limit the hypoxic induction of KCNMB1. Finally, KCNMB1 knockdown potentiated the hypoxia-induced increase in cytosolic calcium in <el> hPASMC <le>, highlighting the contribution of the β1-subunit in modulating vascular SMC tone in response to acute hypoxia. 
In FRTL-5 cells, we and others have shown that TSH and insulin-like growth factor-I (<el> IGF-I <le>) stimulate DNA synthesis synergistically. The present study was undertaken to determine whether interaction between TSH and <el> IGF-I <le> also affects <re> protein synthesis <er> in this cell line, and if so by what mechanism. Quiescent cells were treated with TSH and/or <el> IGF-I <le> and [3H]valine incorporation into the acid-insoluble fraction was measured as a parameter of <re> protein synthesis <er>. Similar to their effects on cell proliferation, TSH or <el> IGF-I <le> alone induced <re> protein synthesis <er> only slightly, but treatment with a combination of TSH and <el> IGF-I <le> (or insulin with about a 100-fold higher concentration than <el> IGF-I <le>) greatly increased <re> protein synthesis <er>. The presence of <el> IGF-I <le> potentiated a TSH-concentration-dependent increase in <re> protein synthesis <er> and in DNA synthesis. In addition, we observed this potentiation when the cells were treated with other cAMP-generating agents and cAMP analogues instead of TSH. We have shown that priming with TSH potentiated DNA synthesis induced by <el> IGF-I <le>, whereas pretreatment with <el> IGF-I <le> enhanced <re> protein synthesis <er> induced by TSH. This observation suggested that <re> protein synthesis <er> and DNA synthesis were potentiated through different mechanisms. From an analysis of cAMP production, it appears that the potentiation of <re> protein synthesis <er> may be explained by an <el> IGF-I <le>-dependent increase in cAMP production induced by TSH at least in part. On the other hand, <el> IGF-I <le> and TSH stimulated (alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) uptake synergistically, but RNA synthesis induced by <el> IGF-I <le> was depressed by TSH. 
1. Whole cell patch clamp recording, <el> Ca <le>(2+) measurement with ratiometric fluorescent dyes and photolysis of caged <el> Ca <le>(2+) were combined to investigate the depolarization- and photolysis-induced suppression of inhibition (<re> DSI <er> and PSI) in rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. 2. A 5-s depolarization from -70 mV to 0 mV or a 6-s photolysis of nitrophenyl-EGTA (NPE) in cell bodies could each depress the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) and the amplitude of evoked IPSCs while elevating intracellular <el> Ca <le>(2+) concentration ([<el> Ca <le>(2+)](i)). 3. Within a cell the elevation of [<el> Ca <le>(2+)](i) induced by depolarization was inversely related to that induced by photolysis, suggesting that higher [NPE] is more effective in releasing caged <el> Ca <le>(2+) but also increases buffer capacity to reduce [<el> Ca <le>(2+)](i) rises caused by <el> Ca <le>(2+) influx through voltage-dependent <el> Ca <le>(2+) channels. 4. Both <re> DSI <er> and PSI were linearly related to [<el> Ca <le>(2+)](i), with a 50 % reduction in transmission occurring at about 3.6--3.9 microM. 5. [<el> Ca <le>(2+)](i) recovered more quickly than <re> DSI <er>, indicating that the duration of <re> DSI <er> is not set simply by the duration of [<el> Ca <le>(2+)](i) elevation, but rather entails other rate-limiting processes. 6. 
Prior to the inception of inspiratory synaptic drive transmission from medullary respiratory centers, rat phrenic motoneurons (PMNs) have action potential and repetitive firing characteristics typical of immature embryonic motoneurons. During the period spanning from when respiratory bulbospinal and segmental afferent synaptic connections are formed at embryonic day 17 (E17) through to birth (gestational period is approximately 21 days), a pronounced transformation of PMN electrophysiological properties occurs. In this study, we test the hypothesis that the elaboration of action potential afterpotentials and the resulting changes in repetitive firing properties are due in large part to developmental changes in PMN <re> potassium <er> conductances. Ionic conductances were measured via whole cell patch recordings using a cervical slice-phrenic nerve preparation isolated from perinatal rats. Voltage- and current-clamp recordings revealed that PMNs expressed outward rectifier (I(KV)) and A-type <re> potassium <er> currents that regulated PMN action potential and repetitive firing properties throughout the perinatal period. There was an age-dependent leftward shift in the activation voltage and a decrease in the time-to-peak of I(KV) during the period from E16 through to birth. The most dramatic change during the perinatal period was the increase in <el> calcium <le>-activated <re> potassium <er> currents after the inception of inspiratory drive transmission at E17. Block of the maxi-type <el> calcium <le>-dependent <re> potassium <er> conductance caused a significant increase in action potential duration and a suppression of the fast afterhyperpolarizing potential. Block of the small conductance <el> calcium <le>-dependent <re> potassium <er> channels resulted in a marked suppression of the medium afterhyperpolarizing potential and an increase in the repetitive firing frequency. 
Through diametric actions, the transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) and Angiotensin II (<el> AngII <le>) play important roles in regulating various biological responses such as cell proliferation and migration. Signaling initiated by TGFbeta and <el> AngII <le> occurs through two structurally and functionally distinct receptor super families,the serine/threonine kinase and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Previously, we identified the Gprotein-coupled receptor kinase-2 (GRK2), a key regulatory factor in the desensitization of GPCRs, as a direct downstream target of the TGFbeta signaling cascade. GRK2 acts through a negative feed-back loop mechanism to terminate TGFbeta-induced smad signaling. To investigate the impact of TGFbeta-induced GRK2 expression on GPCR signaling, we examined its effect on <el> AngII <le> signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). In this study, we show that activation of the TGFbeta signaling cascade in VSMCs results in increased GRK2 expression levels, which consequently inhibits <el> AngII <le>-induced ERK phosphorylation and antagonizes <el> AngII <le>-induced <re> VSMC proliferation <er> and migration. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of TGFbeta on <el> AngII <le> signaling occurs at the Mek-Erk interface and is abrogated when an anti-sense oligonucleotide directed against GRK2 is used. 
The emergence of nanotechnology has produced a multitude of engineered nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and concerns have been raised about their effects on human health, especially for susceptible populations such as individuals with asthma. Multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs) have been shown to exacerbate ovalbumin (OVA)-induced airway remodeling in mice. Moreover, cyclooxygenase-2 (<el> COX-2 <le>) has been described as a protective factor in asthma. We postulated that <el> COX-2 <le>-deficient (<el> COX-2 <le>(-/-)) mice would be susceptible to MWCNT-induced exacerbations of allergen-induced airway remodeling, including airway inflammation, fibrosis, and mucus-cell <re> metaplasia <er> (i.e., the formation of goblet cells). Wild-type (WT) or <el> COX-2 <le>(-/-) mice were sensitized to OVA to induce allergic airway inflammation before a single dose of MWCNTs (4 mg/kg) delivered to the lungs by oropharyngeal aspiration. MWCNTs significantly increased OVA-induced lung inflammation and mucus-cell <re> metaplasia <er> in <el> COX-2 <le>(-/-) mice compared with WT mice. However, airway fibrosis after exposure to allergen and MWCNTs was no different between WT and <el> COX-2 <le>(-/-) mice. Concentrations of certain prostanoids (prostaglandin D2 and thromboxane B2) were enhanced by OVA or MWCNTs in <el> COX-2 <le>(-/-) mice. No differences in COX-1 mRNA concentrations were evident between WT and <el> COX-2 <le>(-/-) mice treated with OVA and MWCNTs. Interestingly, MWCNTs significantly enhanced allergen-induced cytokines involved in Th2 (IL-13 and IL-5), Th1 (CXCL10), and Th17 (IL-17A) inflammatory responses in <el> COX-2 <le>(-/-) mice, but not in WT mice. 
We investigated the role of intracellular Mg(2+) (Mg(i)(2+)) on the <el> ATP <le> regulation of <re> Na <er>(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger in squid axons and bovine heart. In squid axons and nerve vesicles, the <el> ATP <le>-upregulated exchanger remains activated after removal of cytoplasmic Mg(2+), even in the absence of <el> ATP <le>. Rapid and complete deactivation of the <el> ATP <le>-stimulated exchange occurs upon readmission of Mg(i)(2+). At constant <el> ATP <le> concentration, the effect of intracellular Mg(2+) concentration ([Mg(2+)](i)) on the <el> ATP <le> regulation of exchanger is biphasic: activation at low [Mg(2+)](i), followed by deactivation as [Mg(2+)](i) is increased. No correlation was found between the above results and the levels of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P(2)] measured in nerve membrane vesicles. Incorporation of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) into membrane vesicles activates <re> Na <er>(+)/Ca(2+) exchange in mammalian heart but not in squid nerve. Moreover, an exogenous phosphatase prevents MgATP activation in squid nerves but not in mammalian heart. 
The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the incremental value of left atrial (<el> LA <le>) function for the prediction of risk for first atrial fibrillation (<re> AF <er>) or atrial flutter. Maximum and minimum <el> LA <le> volumes were quantitated by echocardiography in 574 adults (mean age 74 +/- 6 years, 52% men) without a history or evidence of atrial arrhythmia. During a mean follow-up period of 1.9 +/- 1.2 years, 30 subjects (5.2%) developed electrocardiographically confirmed <re> AF <er> or atrial flutter. Subjects with new <re> AF <er> or atrial flutter had lower <el> LA <le> reservoir function, as measured by total <el> LA <le> emptying fraction (38% vs 49%, p <0.0001) and higher maximum <el> LA <le> volumes (47 vs 40 ml/m(2), p = 0.005). An increase in age-adjusted risk for <re> AF <er> or atrial flutter was evident when the cohort was stratified according to medians of <el> LA <le> emptying fraction (< or =49%: hazard ratio 6.5, p = 0.001) and <el> LA <le> volume (> or =38 ml/m(2): hazard ratio 2.0, p = 0.07), with the risk being highest for subjects with concomitant <el> LA <le> emptying fractions < or =49% and <el> LA <le> volume > or =38 ml/m(2) (hazard ratio 9.3, p = 0.003). <el> LA <le> emptying fraction (p = 0.002) was associated with risk for first <re> AF <er> or atrial flutter after adjusting for baseline clinical risk factors for <re> AF <er> or atrial flutter, left ventricular ejection fraction, diastolic function grade, and <el> LA <le> volume. 
To measure rate constants for discrete steps of single-round transcription (preinitiation complex formation, promoter escape, and transcript elongation), kinetic studies were performed in a well defined human RNA polymerase II transcription system. These experiments revealed that promoter escape limits the rate of transcription from the adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP) contained on negatively supercoiled DNA. TFIIE and <el> TFIIH <le> were found to significantly increase fractional template usage during a single round of transcription in an <re> ATP <er>-dependent reaction. The observed rate constant for promoter escape, however, was not greatly affected by TFIIE and <el> TFIIH <le>. Our results are explained by a model in which transcription branches into at least two pathways: one that results in functional promoter escape and full-length RNA synthesis, and another in which preinitiation complexes abort during promoter escape and do not produce full-length RNA transcripts. 
Renal failure by bee venom may be related to a malfunction of renal transporters. However, the effects of bee venom on apical membrane transporters of renal proximal tubular cells are not yet known. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of dried bee venom of Apis mellifera and its melittin on apical transporter activity of primary cultured rabbit kidney proximal tubule cells. Bee venom (1 microg/ml) decreased the cell viability and increased lactate dehydrogenase activity over 30-min treatments. Its effect was blocked by mepacrine or AACOCF(3) (10(-6) M; phospholipase A(2) inhibitors). However, there was no effect on cell viability at a concentration of 0.01 microg/ml of bee venom. Thus, we investigated the effect of bee venom (1 microg/ml) on the activity of renal transporters at 30 min. Bee venom inhibited alpha-methyl-D-glucopyranoside, <el> Pi <le>, and Na(+) uptakes, but increased Ca(2+) uptake. These effects of bee venom were blocked by mepacrine or AACOCF(3) (10(-6) M), and bee venom-induced stimulation of Ca(2+) uptake was also blocked by methoxyverapamil and nifedipine (L-type calcium channel blockers). In addition, bee venom increased [(3)H]-<re> arachidonic acid release <er> by 216 % of that of control. In all experiments, bee venom melittin (0.5 microg/ml) had an identical effect to that of bee venom itself. 
Ambrisentan, an endothelin receptor type A antagonist, may be a novel therapeutic agent in neonatal chronic lung disease (CLD) by blocking the adverse effects of the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1, especially pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)-induced right ventricular hypertrophy (<re> RVH <er>). We determined the cardiopulmonary effects of <el> ambrisentan <le> treatment (1-20 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1)) in neonatal rats with CLD in 2 models: early treatment during continuous exposure to hyperoxia for 10 days and late treatment starting on day 6 in rat pups exposed postnatally to hyperoxia for 9 days, followed by a 9-day recovery period in room air. Parameters investigated included survival, lung and heart histopathology, right ventricular function, fibrin deposition, and differential mRNA expression in the lungs. In the early treatment model, we investigated the role of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition with N(ω)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 25 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1)) during <el> ambrisentan <le> treatment. In the early treatment model, <el> ambrisentan <le> improved survival with reduced lung fibrin and collagen III deposition, arterial medial wall thickness, and <re> RVH <er>. These changes were not affected by L-NAME administration. Ambrisentan did not reduce the influx of macrophages and neutrophils or prevent reduced irregular elastin expression. In the late treatment model, <el> ambrisentan <le> diminished PAH, <re> RVH <er>, and right ventricular peak pressure, demonstrating that <re> RVH <er> is reversible in the neonatal period. Alveolarization and vascularization were not affected by <el> ambrisentan <le>. 
A critical role of the Toll-like receptor(TLR) and its downstream molecules, including IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1(<re> IRAK1 <er>) and tumor necrosis factor receptor- associated factor 6(TRAF6), in the pathogenesis of liver ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury has been documented. Recently a microRNA, miR-146a, was identified as a potent negative regulator of the TLR signaling pathway. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-146a to attenuate TLR signaling and liver I/R injury in vivo and in vitro. miR-146a was decreased in mice Kupffer cells following hepatic I/R, whereas <re> IRAK1 <er> and TRAF6 increased. Overexpression of miR-146a directly decreased <re> IRAK1 <er> and TRAF6 expression and attenuated the release of proinflammatory cytokines through the inactivation of NF-κB P65 in <el> hypoxia <le>/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced macrophages, RAW264.7 cells. Knockdown experiments demonstrated that <re> IRAK1 <er> and TRAF6 are two potential targets for reducing the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, co-culture assays indicated that miR-146a decreases the apoptosis of hepatocytes after H/R. In vivo administration of Ago-miR-146a, a stable version of miR-146a in vivo, protected against liver injury in mice after I/R via inactivation of the TLR signaling pathway. 
Chitinase 3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1) is a novel biomarker of systemic <re> inflammation <er>. However, the effects of CHI3L1 on the progression of atherosclerosis remain to be explored. In the current study, we found that CHI3L1 induces peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (<el> PPAR <le>δ) expression, leading to a dose-dependent increase in oxygen-regulated protein 150 (ORP150) expression. We demonstrated that CHI3L1 suppresses atherosclerotic reactions caused by LPS treatment via a <el> PPAR <le>δ-dependent pathway. Treatment of HUVECs and THP-1 cells with CHI3L1 suppressed LPS-induced phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and MCP-1. In HUVECs, expression of adhesion molecules and LPS-stimulated adhesion of THP-1 cells to the endothelium were significantly reduced after CHI3L1 treatment. Furthermore, LPS-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cell apoptosis were significantly ameliorated after treatment of HUVECs with CHI3L1. Particularly, all of the pro-atherosclerotic effects were significantly mitigated by treatment with small interfering (si) RNA for <el> PPAR <le>δ. 
Primary sclerosing <re> cholangitis <er> frequently occurs in association with ulcerative colitis. This close association may be due to colitis predisposing patients to bile ductular injury. Therefore, we determined the susceptibility of rats with experimental colitis to <el> toxin <le>-induced <re> cholangitis <er>. Sprague-Dawley rats received 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene-sulfonic-acid (TNBS) or ethanol vehicle intracolonically. Seven days later, rats received either the biliary epithelial cell <el> toxin <le> alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) or vehicle and were killed 24 hr later. Liver histology, serum biochemistries and tumor-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and hepatic interleukin-10 (IL-10) mRNA were determined. TNBS-treated rats showed extensive macroscopic colonic damage and a 10-fold increase in myeloperoxidase activity compared to ethanol-treated controls. ANIT-treated noncolitic rats showed portal inflammation centered on damaged bile ducts (<re> cholangitis <er>), which was markedly attenuated in ANIT-treated colitic rats. Hepatic IL-10 mRNA was twofold higher in colitic compared to noncolitic rats, with no difference in serum TNF-alpha. 
LIM kinase 1 (<el> LIMK1 <le>) is an important regulator of the cell cytoskeleton. This study aimed to examine the role of <el> LIMK1 <le> in mediating the effects of the <re> Rho <er> kinase (ROCK) inhibitor fasudil. In vitro cultures of urethral fibroblasts were divided into <el> LIMK1 <le> knockdown (<el> LIMK1 <le> KD) and <el> LIMK1 <le> control (<el> LIMK1 <le> NC) experimental groups. Each group was incubated with fasudil (50 μmol/L) with or without transforming growth factor β1 (10 ng/mL) for 24 hours. Wound healing and Transwell assays were performed to determine cell migration. Flow cytometry was used to determine apoptosis. <el> LIMK1 <le>, collagen I, collagen III, phospho-myosin light chain (p-MLC), alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and phospho-Cofilin (p-Cofilin) expression was examined by Western blot analysis. The expression of <el> LIMK1 <le> was further validated in human urethral scar tissues. Transwell and wound healing assays revealed that the cells of the <el> LIMK1 <le> KD group exhibited significantly attenuated migration, when compared with those of the <el> LIMK1 <le> NC group ( P < 0.05). Cell migration was also attenuated in the <el> LIMK1 <le> KD group treated with fasudil ( P < 0.05). Flow cytometry analysis revealed that apoptosis was higher in the <el> LIMK1 <le> KD group than that in <el> LIMK1 <le> NC group ( P < 0.05). Apoptosis was also enhanced in the <el> LIMK1 <le> KD group treated with fasudil ( P < 0.05). Western blot analysis demonstrated that <el> LIMK1 <le>, collagen I, collagen III, p-MLC, α-SMA, and p-Cofilin expression was significantly attenuated in both the fasudil-treated and untreated <el> LIMK1 <le> KD groups ( P < 0.05). <el> LIMK1 <le> was positively expressed in human urethral scar tissues while it was negatively expressed in normal urethra tissues. 
<el> CAPS-1 <le> is required for <re> Ca2 <er>+-triggered fusion of dense-core vesicles with the plasma membrane, but its site of action and mechanism are unknown. We analyzed the kinetics of <re> Ca2 <er>+-triggered exocytosis reconstituted in permeable PC12 cells. <el> CAPS-1 <le> increased the initial rate of <re> Ca2 <er>+-triggered vesicle exocytosis by acting at a rate-limiting, <re> Ca2 <er>+-dependent prefusion step. <el> CAPS-1 <le> activity depended upon prior ATP-dependent priming during which PIP2 synthesis occurs. <el> CAPS-1 <le> activity and binding to the plasma membrane depended upon PIP2. <re> Ca2 <er>+ was ineffective in triggering vesicle fusion in the absence of <el> CAPS-1 <le> but instead promoted desensitization to <el> CAPS-1 <le> resulting from decreased plasma membrane PIP2. 
A new compound, APAZA, consisting of a molecule of 5-aminosalicylic acid linked to one molecule of 4-aminophenylacetic acid by an azo bond, was testedfor its ability to inhibit acute colitis in rats caused by Clostridium difficile <el> toxin A <le>. When administered chronically for 5 days in drinking water, APAZA significantly inhibited <el> toxin A <le>-induced myeloperoxidase activity, luminal fluid accumulation, and structural damage to the colon at doses of from 1 to 100 mg/kg x day. For comparison, sulfasalazine was administered in identical doses and was found to significantly inhibit <el> toxin A <le>-induced colitis only at the dose of 100 mg/kg x day. When 4-aminophenylacetic acid alone was administered chronically in drinking water, it also inhibited <el> toxin A <le>-induced colonic <re> inflammation <er> at a dose of 100 mg/kg x day. In order to determine if 4-aminophenylacetic acid has a direct anti-inflammatory effect on the colon rather than a systemic effect, 4-aminophenylacetic acid was administered acutely to surgically prepared isolated colonic segments by intraluminal injection in anesthetized rats 30 min before <el> toxin A <le> was injected. 4-Aminophenylacetic acid strongly and significantly inhibited <el> toxin A <le>-induced colitis in this experiment at doses as low as 10 microg/segment. 
Presentation of a study conducted on 20 male Wistar rats treated for 3 months with Leuprolide (<el> LHRH <le> agonist). Analysis of pathophysiological testicular changes resulting from the treatment and extent of recovery at 3 months of therapy discontinuation, relating those changes to testosterone plasma levels in peripheral blood. Serum testosterone fell to 1.17 +/- 0.30 ng/ml in the treated group, shifting to figures overlapping with normal values within 3 months of discontinuing treatment. Such decreased <re> testosterone levels <er> translate into significant testicular histological damage. Three months after interruption of treatment there is nearly complete recovery of such damage, with just around 10% tubules without spermatozoa, with unchanged germinal line. 
We have recently elucidated a novel function for CD82 in E-cadherin-mediated homocellular <re> adhesion <er>; due to this function, it can inhibit cancer cell dissociation from the primary cancer nest and limit metastasis. However, the effect of CD82 on selectin ligand-mediated heterocellular <re> adhesion <er> has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we focused on the effects of the metastasis suppressor CD82/KAI1 on heterocellular <re> adhesion <er> of cancer cells to the endothelium of blood vessels in order to further elucidate the function of tetraspanins. The over-expression of CD82 in cancer cells led to the inhibition of experimentally induced lung metastases in mice and significantly inhibited the <re> adhesion <er> of these cells to human umbilical vein epithelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. Pre-treatment of the cells with function-perturbing antibodies against <el> sLea/x <le> significantly inhibited the <re> adhesion <er> of CD82-negative cells to HUVECs. In addition, cells over-expressing CD82 exhibited reduced expression of <el> sLea/x <le> compared to CD82-negative wild-type cells. Significant down-regulation of ST3 β-galactoside α-2, 3-sialyltransferase 4 (ST3GAL4) was detected by cDNA microarray, real-time PCR, and western blotting analyses. Knockdown of ST3GAL4 on CD82-negative wild-type cells inhibited expression of sLex and reduced cell <re> adhesion <er> to HUVECs. 
Hyperoxia contributes to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in human preterm infants and a similar lung phenotype characterized by alveolar simplification in newborn mice. Omeprazole (<el> OM <le>) is a proton pump inhibitor that is used to treat humans with gastric acid related disorders. <el> OM <le>-mediated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (<re> AhR <er>) activation attenuates acute hyperoxic lung injury (HLI) in adult mice. Whether <el> OM <le> activates pulmonary <re> AhR <er> and protects C57BL/6J newborn mice against hyperoxia-induced developmental lung (alveolar and pulmonary vascular simplification, inflammation, and oxidative stress) injury (HDLI) is unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that <el> OM <le> will activate pulmonary <re> AhR <er> and mitigate HDLI in newborn mice. Newborn mice were treated daily with i.p. injections of <el> OM <le> at doses of 10 (<el> OM <le>10) or 25 (<el> OM <le>25) mg/kg while being exposed to air or hyperoxia (FiO2 of 85%) for 14 days, following which their lungs were harvested to determine alveolarization, pulmonary vascularization, inflammation, oxidative stress, vascular injury, and <re> AhR <er> activation. To our surprise, hyperoxia-induced alveolar and pulmonary vascular simplification, inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular injury were augmented in <el> OM <le>25-treated animals. These findings were associated with attenuated pulmonary vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 expression and decreased pulmonary <re> AhR <er> activation in the <el> OM <le>25 group. 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide. Low levels of <el> vitamin D <le> are associated with high risk of myocardial infarction, even after controlling for factors associated with coronary artery disease. A growing body of evidence indicates that <el> vitamin D <le> plays an important role in CVD-related signaling pathways. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism by which <el> vitamin D <le> modulates heart development. The WNT signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in tissue development by controlling stem cell renewal, lineage selection and, even more importantly, heart development. In this study, we examined the role of 1,25-D3 (the active form of <el> vitamin D <le>) on cardiomyocyte proliferation, apoptosis, cell phenotype, cell cycle progression and <re> differentiation <er> into cardiomyotubes. We determined that the addition of 1,25-D3 to cardiomyocytes cells: i) inhibits cell proliferation without promoting apoptosis; ii) decreases expression of genes related to the regulation of the cell cycle; iii) promotes formation of cardiomyotubes; iv) induces the expression of casein kinase-1-α1, a negative regulator of the canonical WNT signaling pathway; and v) increases the expression of the noncanonical WNT11, which it has been demonstrated to induce cardiac <re> differentiation <er> during embryonic development and in adult cells. 
Polydatin (PD), a resveratrol glycoside, has been shown to protect renal function in diabetic nephropathy (DN), but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. This study demonstrates that PD stabilize the mitochondrial morphology and attenuate mitochondrial malfunction in both KKAy mice and in hyperglycemia (<el> HG <le>)-induced MPC5 cells. We use Western blot analysis to demonstrate that PD reversed podocyte <re> apoptosis <er> induced by <el> HG <le> via suppressing dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). This effect may depend on the ability of PD to inhibit the generation of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). 
Recent studies suggest that an increase in <re> apoptosis <er> within the myocardium may be a contributing factor for the progression of late adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling following myocardial infarction (MI). Given that <re> apoptosis <er> is often triggered by induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore, the goal of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of cyclosporin A (<el> CsA <le>), an MPT blocker, to prevent cells from undergoing <re> apoptosis <er> and consequently attenuate late LV remodeling post-MI. MI was induced in C57BL/6 mice and then randomized to either vehicle or <el> CsA <le> groups. Beginning 48 h after surgery after infarction had already occurred, mice were gavaged with <el> CsA <le> (2 mg/kg) or vehicle once daily. LV end-diastolic volume and LV ejection fraction were assessed by echocardiography before MI induction and terminally at either 7 days (n = 7) or 28 days (n = 8) post-MI. LV end-diastolic volume increased and LV ejection fraction decreased in all MI groups with no difference between the <el> CsA <le>-treated and untreated groups. After vehicle and <el> CsA <le>, areas of necrosis were present at 7 and 28 days post-MI with no difference between treatment groups. Caspase-3 activity and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP-mediated nick-end labeling in distal nonnecrotic LV both increased after MI but were lower in <el> CsA <le>-treated mice compared with vehicle (P < 0.05). 
Abnormalities in social behavior are found in almost all psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety, depression, autism, and schizophrenia. Thus, comprehension of the neurobiological basis of social interaction is important for a better understanding of numerous pathologies and improved treatments. Several findings have suggested that an alteration of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) receptor function could be involved in the pathophysiology of such disorders. However, the role of <el> CB1 receptors <le> is still unclear, and their localisation on different neuronal subpopulations may produce distinct outcomes. To dissect the role of <el> CB1 receptors <le> in different neuronal populations, we used male knockout <re> mice <er> and their respective control littermates [total deletion (CB1(-/-) ); specific deletion on cortical glutamatergic neurons (Glu-CB1(-/-) ) or on GABAergic interneurons (GABA-CB1(-/-) ), and wild-type (WT) <re> mice <er> treated with the CB1 antagonist/inverse agonist SR141716A (3 mg/kg). Mice were required to perform different social tasks - direct social interaction and social investigation. Direct interaction of two male <re> mice <er> was not modified in any group; however, when they were paired with females, Glu-CB1(-/-) <re> mice <er> showed reduced interaction. Also, exploration of the male stimulus subject in the three-chamber social investigation test was almost unaffected. The situation was completely different when a female was used as the stimulus subject. In this case, Glu-CB1(-/-) <re> mice <er> showed reduced interest in the social stimulus, mimicking the phenotype of CB1(-/-) or WT <re> mice <er> treated with SR141716A. GABA-CB1(-/-) <re> mice <er> showed the opposite phenotype, by spending more time investigating the social stimulus. 
Calcium (Ca) is an inhibitory second messenger in <re> renin secretion <er>, and it has been proposed that some first messengers, such as angiotensin II (A-II), antidiuretic hormone (<el> ADH <le>), and N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA), increase Ca and thereby inhibit <re> renin secretion <er> by mobilizing Ca from intracellular sequestration sites. The present experiments were designed to test this proposal by using dantrolene, an antagonist of intracellular Ca mobilization. Dantrolene stimulated <re> renin secretion <er> by rat renal cortical slices in a concentration dependent manner; at 0.0, 0.1, and 0.5 mM dantrolene, secretory rates were 8.1 +/- 0.6, 9.4 +/- 0.6 (p less than 0.05), and 14.9 +/- 1.2 (p less than 0.0001) GU/g x hr, respectively. These results could be interpreted to mean that Ca mobilization is occurring at a finite rate during the basal state, and that by antagonizing this process, dantrolene lowers intracellular Ca and thereby stimulates <re> renin secretion <er>. However, 0.1 mM dantrolene failed to antagonize the inhibitory effects on <re> renin secretion <er> of A-II, <el> ADH <le>, and CHA, and only CHA-induced inhibition of <re> renin secretion <er> was antagonized by 0.5 mM dantrolene. 
Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element that has several functions in cellular processes related to cancer prevention. While the cancericidal effect of Se has been reported in liver cancer, the mechanism has not been clarified. MiR-29a has widely been reported as a tumor suppressor; however, it also acts as a carcinogenic agent by increasing cell <re> invasion <er> in human epithelial cancer cells and hepatoma cells. In a previous study, we found that <el> miR-29a-3p <le> is a Se-sensitive miRNA. However, its effect in the chicken hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (LMH) is still unknown. In the present study, we found that the expression of <el> miR-29a-3p <le> in LMH cells was decreased by Se supplementation and increased under Se-deficient conditions. Flow cytometry and CCK-8 results suggested that Se decreased LMH cell proliferation induced by <el> miR-29a-3p <le> overexpression. Transwell and gap-closure assays implied that Se mediated LMH cell <re> invasion <er> and migration by downregulating <el> miR-29a-3p <le>. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting results suggested that Se mitigated <el> miR-29a-3p <le> overexpression-induced LMH cell proliferation by downregulating CDK2, cyclin-D1, CDK6, and cyclin-E1. We further demonstrated that collagen type IV alpha 2 (COL4A2) is a target gene of <el> miR-29a-3p <le>. COL4A2 activates the RhoA/ROCK pathway to promote LMH cell <re> invasion <er> and migration. 
Atherogenesis involves an early endothelial dysfunction hallmarked by elevated free radical production and increased adhesiveness for monocytes. It was hypothesized that activation of the tissue <re> renin <er> angiotensin system may contribute to the endothelial alteration. To test this hypothesis, thoracic aortae were isolated from normocholesterolemic (NC; n = 6) and hypercholesterolemic (HC; n = 6; diet: 0.5% cholesterol; 6 weeks) New Zealand white rabbits, and incubated for 2 h with the angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonist Sar-1,Ile-8-Ang II, the antioxidant pyrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) and the protein kinase C (PKC) antagonist staurosporin. Superoxide production from aortic segments was measured by lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence. In comparison to the normocholesterolemic state, <el> hypercholesterolemia <le> led to a significant increase in superoxide production (221 +/- 44%, p < 0.02); this was reduced by ex vivo treatment of the vessel segment with Ang II-antagonist (to 130 +/- 29%; p < 0.04 vs HC), or PKC-antagonist (to 86 +/- 26%; p < 0.001 vs HC), or PDTC (to 103 +/- 27%; p < 0.02 vs HC). Monocyte-endothelial interaction was assessed by functional binding assay. When compared to normocholesterolemic rabbits, <el> hypercholesterolemia <le> led to a twofold increase in monocyte binding (74 +/- 13 vs 37 +/- 4 monocytoid cells per high power field (m/hpf); p < 0.03). The Ang II-antagonist and the PKC-antagonist led to a normalization of monocyte-endothelial binding (Ang II-antagonist: 37 +/- 9 m/hpf; PKC-antagonist: 41 +/- 17 m/hpf; p < 0.05). 
1. The purpose of this study was to investigate the antitussive activity and sites of action of the NK1 and NK2 tachykinin receptor antagonists, <el> CP-99,994 <le>, SR 48968, and the racemate of SR 48968, SR 48212A in the cat and guinea-pig. 2. Guinea-pigs were dosed subcutaneously (s.c.) with <el> CP-99,994 <le>, SR 48212A or SR 48968 one hour before exposure to aerosols of capsaicin (0.3 mM) to elicit <re> cough <er>ing. Coughs were detected with a microphone and counted. 3. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) cannulae were placed in the lateral cerebral ventricles of anaesthetized guinea-pigs. Approximately one week later, the animals were dosed with <el> CP-99,994 <le> or SR 48212A (i.c.v.) and exposed to aerosols of capsaicin (0.3 mM) to elicit <re> cough <er>ing. 4. Cough was produced in anaesthetized cats by mechanical stimulation of the intrathoracic trachea and was monitored from electromyograms of respiratory muscle activity. Cannulae were placed for intravenous (i.v.) or, in separate groups of animals, intravertebral arterial (i.a.) administration of <el> CP-99,994 <le>, SR 48212A or SR 48968. Dose-response relationships for i.v. and i.a. administration of each drug were generated to determine a ratio of i.v. ED50 to i.a. ED50, known as the effective dose ratio (EDR). The EDR will be 20 or greater for a centrally active drug and less than 20 for a peripherally active drug. 5. In the guinea-pig, <el> CP-99,994 <le> (0.1-30 mg kg-1, s.c.), SR 48212A (1.0-30 mg kg-1, s.c.), and SR 48968 (0.3-3.0 mg kg-1, s.c.) inhibited capsaicin-induced <re> cough <er> in a dose-dependent manner. Capsaicin-induced <re> cough <er> was also inhibited by i.c.v. administration of <el> CP-99,994 <le> (10 and 100 micrograms) or SR 48212A (100 micrograms). 6. In the cat, both <el> CP-99,994 <le> (0.0001-0.3 mg kg-1, i.a., n = 5; 0.003-3.0 mg kg-1, i.v., n = 5) and SR 48212A (0.003-1.0 mg kg-1, i.a., n = 5; 0.01-3.0 mg kg-1, i.v., n = 5) inhibited mechanically induced <re> cough <er> by either the i.v. or i.a. routes in a dose-dependent manner. SR 48968 (0.001-0.3 mg kg-1, i.a., n = 5; 0.03-1.0 mg kg-1, i.v., n = 5) inhibited <re> cough <er> when administered by the i.a. route in a dose-dependent manner, but had no effect by the i.v. route up to a dose of 1.0 mg kg-1. Intravenous antitussive potencies (ED50, 95% confidence interval (CI) of these compounds were: <el> CP-99,994 <le> (0.082 mg kg-1, 95% CI 0.047-0.126), SR 48212A (2.3 mg kg-1, 95% CI 0.5-20), and SR 48968 (> 1.0 mg kg-1, 95% CI not determined). The intra-arterial potencies of these compounds were: <el> CP-99,994 <le> (1.0 microgram kg-1, 95% CI 0.4-1.8), SR 48212A (25 micrograms kg-1, 95% CI 13-52), and SR 48968 (8.0 micrograms kg-1, 95% CI 1-32). The derived EDRs for each compound were: <el> CP-99,994 <le>, 82; SR 48212A, 92; and SR 48968, > 125. 7. 
In a number of experimental systems, the early stage of the apoptotic process, i.e., the stage that precedes nuclear disintegration, is characterized by the breakdown of the inner mitochondrial transmembrane potential (delta psi(m)). This delta psi(m) disruption may involve mitochondrial permeability transition (<el> PT <le>). Here, we address the question of whether <el> PT <le> transition would suffice to cause <re> apoptosis <er> or, rather, it would constitute a secondary event not causally involved in the apoptotic cascade. Protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), a ligand of the mitochondrial benzodiazepin receptor that is well known for its <el> PT <le>-triggering capacity, induces delta psi(m) disruption, enhanced generation of superoxide anions, as well as signs of nuclear <re> apoptosis <er> in thymocytes and in T cells. The sequence of events triggered by PPIX mimics that observed in natural <re> apoptosis <er>. The <el> PT <le> inhibitory compound bongkrekic acid, a specific ligand of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator, is an efficient inhibitor of protoporphyrin IX-induced delta psi(m) disruption. Bongkrekic acid prevents all PPIX-induced phenomena, including superoxide anion generation, chromatinolysis, and oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation. In contrast, inhibitors of mRNA or protein synthesis fail to suppress PPIX-induced delta psi(m) disruption and <re> apoptosis <er>. Transfection-enforced hyperexpression of the <re> apoptosis <er>-inhibitory proto-oncogene bcl-2 also inhibits PPIX-induced delta psi(m) disruption, hyperproduction of reactive oxygen species, and nuclear DNA loss. The delta psi(m)-stabilizing effect of Bcl-2 is observed both in cells and in isolated mitochondria. 
Biological actions attributed to the adrenomedullin (AM) peptides, AM and <el> AM2 <le>, include reduction of arterial pressure and peripheral resistance. While AM has been shown to reduce aldosterone secretion from the adrenal, little information is available regarding possible actions of <el> AM2 <le> on aldosterone. Evidence suggests that AM may act as a functional antagonist to angiotensin II (<re> Ang II <er>) but such a role has not been investigated for <el> AM2 <le>. Accordingly, we have examined hemodynamic and adrenal responses to stepped <re> Ang II <er> infusions with or without co-infusions of <el> AM2 <le> (33ng/(kgmin)) in conscious sheep under controlled conditions of a low sodium intake. The dose-dependent pressor response (5-50mmHg) of <re> Ang II <er> was both delayed and attenuated (p<0.001) by <el> AM2 <le> which also stimulated heart rate (p<0.001) and cardiac output (p<0.001). <el> AM2 <le> prevented <re> Ang II <er>-induced increases in peripheral resistance (p<0.001). In contrast, plasma aldosterone responses to <re> Ang II <er> were not significantly altered by concomitant <el> AM2 <le> infusion. 
The enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (<re> 11beta-HSD1 <er>) catalyzes the conversion of inactive to active glucocorticoids. <re> 11beta-HSD1 <er> plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of obesity and controls glucocorticoid actions in inflammation. Several studies have demonstrated that <el> TNF-alpha <le> increases <re> 11beta-HSD1 <er> mRNA and activity in various cell models. Here, we demonstrate that mRNA and activity of <re> 11beta-HSD1 <er> is increased in liver tissue from transgenic mice overexpressing <el> TNF-alpha <le>, indicating that this effect also occurs in vivo. To dissect the molecular mechanism of this increase, we investigated basal and <el> TNF-alpha <le>-induced transcription of the <re> 11beta-HSD1 <er> gene (HSD11B1) in HepG2 cells. We found that <el> TNF-alpha <le> acts via p38 MAPK pathway. Transient transfections with variable lengths of human HSD11B1 promoter revealed highest activity with or without <el> TNF-alpha <le> in the proximal promoter region (-180 to +74). Cotransfection with human CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha (C/EBPalpha) and C/EBPbeta-LAP expression vectors activated the HSD11B1 promoter with the strongest effect within the same region. Gel shift and RNA interference assays revealed the involvement of mainly C/EBPalpha, but also C/EBPbeta, in basal and only of C/EBPbeta in the <el> TNF-alpha <le>-induced HSD11B1 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed in vivo the increased abundance of C/EBPbeta on the proximal HSD11B1 promoter upon <el> TNF-alpha <le> treatment. 
Although a signature of increased interferon (IFN-)alpha production is observed in HIV-1 <el> infection <le>, the response of circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells (<re> PDC <er>) to Toll-like receptor ligand stimulation is substantially impaired. This functional <re> PDC <er> deficit, which we specifically observed in HIV-1 infected individuals with less than 500 CD4+ T cells/µl, is not well understood. We provide evidence that the peripheral IFN-alpha production in HIV-1 <el> infection <le> is actively suppressed by the enhanced interaction of CD40 ligand (CD40L), a member of the tumor necrosis factor family, and its receptor CD40, which are both upregulated upon immune activation. Plasma levels of soluble CD40L were significantly higher in untreated HIV-1 infected individuals (n = 52) than in subjects on long-term antiretroviral therapy (n = 62, p<0.03) and in uninfected control donors (n = 16, p<0.001). Concomitantly, cell-associated CD40L and the expression of the receptor CD40 on the <re> PDC <er> were significantly upregulated in HIV-1 <el> infection <le> (p<0.05). Soluble and cell-associated CD40L inhibited the <re> PDC <er>-derived IFN-alpha production by CpG oligodeoxynucleotides dose-dependently. This suppressive effect was observed at much lower, physiological CD40L concentrations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of HIV-1 infected individuals compared to controls (p<0.05). The CpG-induced IFN-alpha production in PBMC of HIV-1 infected donors was directly correlated with <re> PDC <er> and CD4+ T cell counts, and inversely correlated with the viral loads (p<0.001). In HIV-1 infected donors with less than 500 CD4+ T cells/µl, the CpG-induced IFN-alpha production was significantly correlated with the percentage of CD40-expressing <re> PDC <er> and the level of CD40 expression on these cells (p<0.05), whereas CD40L plasma levels played a minor role. In addition, low-dose CD40L contributed to the enhanced production of interleukin 6 and 8 in PBMC of HIV-1 infected donors compared to controls. 
Cardiac myofibroblasts (<re> CMF <er>) play a key role in infarct repair and scar formation following myocardial infarction (MI) and are also an important source of proinflammatory cytokines. We postulated that interleukin-1alpha (<el> IL-1alpha <le>), a potential early trigger of acute inflammation post-MI, could stimulate human <re> CMF <er> to express additional proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, we hypothesized that these effects may be modulated by the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10). Human <re> CMF <er> were cultured from atrial biopsies from multiple patients. Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) mRNA expression and secretion were measured using quantitative real-time RT-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. <el> IL-1alpha <le> (0.001-10 ng/ml, 0-6 h) stimulated IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 mRNA expression with distinct temporal and concentration profiles, resulting in increased cytokine secretion. The response to <el> IL-1alpha <le> was much greater than with TNF-alpha. Neither <el> IL-1alpha <le> nor TNF-alpha treatment modulated CT-1 mRNA expression. Immunoblotting with phosphospecific antibodies revealed that <el> IL-1alpha <le> stimulated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)/protein kinase B (Akt), and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signaling pathways. Pharmacological inhibitor studies indicated roles for PI 3-kinase/Akt and NF-kappaB pathways in mediating IL-1beta expression, and for NF-kappaB and p38 MAPK pathways in mediating TNF-alpha expression. <el> IL-1alpha <le>-induced IL-6 mRNA expression was reduced by p38 MAPK inhibition, but increased by ERK and JNK pathway inhibitors. IL-10 produced a consistent but modest reduction in <el> IL-1alpha <le>-induced IL-6 mRNA levels (not IL-1beta or TNF-alpha), but this was not reflected by reduced IL-6 protein secretion. 
Malonyl-CoA significantly increased the Km for <re> L-carnitine <er> of overt carnitine palmitoyltransferase in liver mitochondria from fed rats. This effect was observed when the molar palmitoyl-CoA/albumin concentration ratio was low (0.125-1.0), but not when it was higher (2.0). In the absence of <el> malonyl-CoA <le>, the Km for <re> L-carnitine <er> increased with increasing palmitoyl-CoA/albumin ratios. Malonyl-CoA did not increase the Km for <re> L-carnitine <er> in liver mitochondria from 24h-starved rats or in heart mitochondria from fed animals. The Km for <re> L-carnitine <er> of the latent form of carnitine palmitoyltransferase was 3-4 times that for the overt form of the enzyme. At low ratios of palmitoyl-CoA/albumin (0.5), the concentration of <el> malonyl-CoA <le> causing a 50% inhibition of overt carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity was decreased by 30% when assays with liver mitochondria from fed rats were performed at 100 microM-instead of 400 microM-carnitine. Such a decrease was not observed with liver mitochondria from starved animals. L-Carnitine displaced [14C]<el> malonyl-CoA <le> from liver mitochondrial binding sites. D-Carnitine was without effect. L-Carnitine did not displace [14C]<el> malonyl-CoA <le> from heart mitochondria. 
The aim of the present study was to explore the mechanisms underlying angiotensin II <el> AT2 <le> receptor modulation of AT1 receptor-mediated vasoconstriction in the rat isolated uterine artery, since previous studies have suggested that <el> AT2 <le> receptors may oppose AT1 receptor-mediated effects. Segments of uterine artery were obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats and mounted in small vessel myographs. Concentration-response (CR) curves to angiotensin II (0.1 nm-0.1 microM) were constructed in the absence and presence of PD 123319 (<el> AT2 <le> antagonist; 1 microM), HOE 140 (bradykinin B2 antagonist; 0.1 microM), Nomega-nitro-l-arginine (<re> NO <er>LA) (<re> NO <er>S inhibitor; 30 microM), as well as combinations of these inhibitors. Contractile responses to angiotensin II were expressed as a percent of the response to a K+ depolarizing solution. PD 123319 (1 microM) potentiated angiotensin II-induced contractions; reflected by a significant four-fold leftward shift of the angiotensin II CR curve. HOE 140 (0.1 microM) significantly increased the pEC50 of the angiotensin II CR curve. The combination of HOE 140 plus PD 123319 did not produce additive potentiation. <re> NO <er>LA (30 microM) significantly enhanced sensitivity to angiotensin II, seen as a five-fold leftward shift of the curve, and an augmented maximum contractile response. Combinations of PD 123319 (1 microM) plus <re> NO <er>LA, and of HOE 140 (0.1 microM) plus <re> NO <er>LA, both induced a similar magnitude of potentiation. Cyclic GMP measurements confirmed angiotensin II-induced activation of the nitric oxide (<re> NO <er>) pathway. 
Oxidative stress and <re> autophagy <er> are involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. The relationship between oxidative stress and <re> autophagy <er> is a hot spot of scientific research. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a natural antioxidant. ALA has been reported to reduce oxidative stress and apoptosis in PD models, but its role in <re> autophagy <er> regulation of PD has been reported very little. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of ALA on <el> 6-OHDA <le> induced neurotoxicity, and explored the potential mechanisms associated with the crosstalk between oxidative stress and <re> autophagy <er>. Our results showed that <el> 6-OHDA <le> induced accumulation of ROS in SH-SY5Y cells, accompanied by excessive <re> autophagy <er> and apoptosis. ALA protected against <el> 6-OHDA <le> induced neuronal death through inhibition of oxidative stress and <re> autophagy <er>. Furthermore, we found that ALA inhibited AMPK phosphorylation while activated mTOR phosphorylation thereby blocking AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway involved <re> autophagy <er>. 
cAMP-elevating agents such as <el> forskolin <le> and vasoactive intestinal peptide induce liquid secretion by tracheobronchial submucosal glands. This pathway is thought to be CFTR dependent and thus defective in cystic fibrosis; however, the ionic mechanism that drives this secretion process is incompletely understood. To better define this mechanism, we studied the effects of ion transport inhibitors on the <el> forskolin <le>-induced liquid secretion response (<re> Jv <er>) of porcine distal bronchi. The <el> forskolin <le>-induced <re> Jv <er> was driven by a combination of bumetanide-sensitive Cl- secretion and DIDS-sensitive HCO3- secretion. When Cl- secretion was inhibited with bumetanide, Na+/H+ exchange-dependent HCO3- secretion was apparently induced to compensate for the loss of Cl- secretion. The <el> forskolin <le>-induced <re> Jv <er> was significantly inhibited by the anion channel blockers 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid, diphenylamine-2-carboxylate, and glibenclamide. 
Unbalanced accumulation of fibers in extracellular matrix (ECM) results from attachment and activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) during chronic liver diseases, in which the content of hyaluronic acid (<el> HA <le>), a glycosaminoglycan, in ECM changes. No information is available on the effect of <el> HA <le> on <re> adhesion <er> and activation of HSCs although that of collagen (Col) on HSCs was extensively studied. This study investigated the effects of <el> HA <le> with or without Col on <re> adhesion <er> of HSCs or the rate of DNA synthesis. Attachment of primary cultured HSCs was microscopically monitored in the plate simultaneously coated with <el> HA <le> or other ECM components. <el> HA <le> inhibited <re> adhesion <er> of quiescent HSCs at least up to 7 days after seeding, whereas HSCs were adherent to plastic or type I collagen (Col-I), type III collagen (Col-III), type IV collagen (Col-IV) or fibronectin. Both microscopy and alpha-smooth muscle actin immunocytochemistry revealed that the number of HSCs, which had been re-seeded after 15 days of culture, attached to <el> HA <le>-coated area was remarkably lower compared to that of HSCs on Col-I or plastic. Incorporation of <el> HA <le> into Col-I prevented <re> adhesion <er> of activated HSCs to matrix film. The number of HSCs adherent to <el> HA <le> at early times after seeding was minimal and significantly lower than that of the cells adherent to plastic. In contrast, either Col-I or Col-IV increased the number of adherent cells. Attachment of HSCs to plastic was inhibited by soluble <el> HA <le> in culture medium. CD44, the cell surface receptor to which <el> HA <le> binds, was immunochemically detected in HSCs. Adhesion of HSCs to plastic, <el> HA <le> or Col-I was not changed by anti-CD44 antibody. Either <el> HA <le> or Col increased the basal or platelet-derived growth factor-inducible rate of thymidine incorporation into DNA in HSCs. 
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1 families including CYP1A1, 1A2 and 1B1 are well known to be deeply involved in the initiation of several cancers, due to the fact that they activate environmental pro-carcinogens to form ultimate carcinogens. Benzo[a]pyrene (<el> BaP <le>) is one of the major classes of prototypical pro-carcinogen. It is activated by the CYP1 family to its ultimate carcinogenic forms, mainly <el> BaP <le>-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE), and it forms adducts with DNA. This has been recognized to be a major initiation pathway for cancer. Our previous study demonstrated that chrysoeriol, which is a dietary methoxyflavonoid, selectively inhibited CYP1B1 enzymatic activity and might protect the CYP1B1 related-diseases such as breast cancer. In the present study, we further examined the effects of chrysoeriol on the other initiation pathway of cancer relating to the CYP1 family with <el> BaP <le> in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. The effects of chrysoeriol on the formation of BPDE-DNA adducts were analyzed specifically using the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. When MCF-7 cells were incubated with 2 microM <el> BaP <le> for 24h, three types of BPDE-dG adducts, especially (+)-trans-BPDE-dG as the dominant adduct, were detected. Co-treatment of MCF-7 cells with 10 microM chrysoeriol and <el> BaP <le> remarkably reduced (+)-trans-BPDE-dG formation. Chrysoeriol (1-10 microM) dose-dependently inhibited both EROD activity and the gene expressions of CYP1A1, 1B1 and 1A2 stimulated by treatment with <el> BaP <le>. In addition, the same amounts of chrysoeriol significantly inhibited the binding of <el> BaP <le> to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (<re> AhR <er>), which is the key factor concerning the induction of the CYP1 families. 
Mitochondrial dysfunction is known as one of causative factors in Alzheimer's disease (AD), inducing neuronal cell death. Mitochondria regulate their functions through changing their morphology. The present work was undertaken to investigate whether Amyloid β (Aβ) affects mitochondrial morphology in neuronal cells to induce apoptosis. Aβ treatment induced not only the fragmentation of mitochondria but also neuronal apoptosis in association with an increase in caspase-9 and -3 activity. Calcium influx induced by Aβ up-regulated the activation of <el> Akt <le> through CaMKII resulting in changes to the phosphorylation level of Drp1 in a time-dependent manner. Translocation of Drp1 from the cytosol to mitochondria was blocked by CB-124005 (an <el> Akt <le> inhibitor). Recruitment of Drp1 to mitochondria led to ROS generation and mitochondrial fission, accompanied by dysfunction of mitochondria such as loss of membrane potential and ATP production. ROS generation and mitochondrial dysfunction by Aβ were attenuated when treated with Mdivi-1, a selective Drp1 inhibitor. Furthermore, the sustained <el> Akt <le> activation induced not only the fragmentation of mitochondria but also the activation of mTOR, eventually suppressing <re> autophagy <er>. Inhibition of autophagic clearance of Aβ led to increased ROS levels and aggravating mitochondrial defects, which were blocked by Rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor). 
We tested whether diet-induced <re> obesity <er> results from increased energy consumption, is associated with changes in expression of genes involved in leptin signal transduction, and is altered by hyperleptinemia. C57BL/6 mice were fed a low-fat diet (LFD) or high-fat diet (<el> HFD <le>) for up to 15 weeks. <el> HFD <le> mice weighed significantly more than LFD controls by 3 weeks, despite consuming less energy. <el> HFD <le> mice had significantly greater leptin, insulin, and glucose levels than LFD mice, suggesting leptin and insulin resistance. Adiponectin levels declined with age but were unaffected by diet. <el> HFD <le> was associated with altered hypothalamic expression of genes whose products regulate the activity or nuclear translocation of STAT3, an important mediator of leptin actions. Expression of two isoforms of the leptin receptor decreased at 15 weeks in hypothalami of <el> HFD <le> mice in a tissue-specific manner. The type of fat (saturated versus unsaturated) did not influence weight gain on an <el> HFD <le>, but animals on LFD gained significantly more weight and adiposity if the dietary fat consisted mostly of saturated fats; this occurred despite no difference in energy consumption or absorption. Replacement of leptin to leptin-deficient ob/ob mice decreased hypothalamic leptin receptor expression and did not prevent <el> HFD <le>-induced weight gain. 
Recombinant human <el> P2X <le>(7) receptors, C-terminally labelled with enhanced green fluorescent protein (<el> P2X <le>(7)-EGFP), were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. Activation of these receptors by their preferential agonist 2',3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-<re> ATP <er> (BzATP) induced inward currents and propidium ion uptake indicating the opening of cationic channels and of large pores permeable for dye molecules, respectively. Two mutants of <el> P2X <le>(7) receptors (<el> P2X <le>(7)-EGFP-I568N, -E496A) representing polymorphisms in the <el> P2X <le>(7) gene known to interfere with normal receptor-trafficking and with optimal assembly of its subunits, responded with much lower current amplitudes to BzATP than their wild-type counterpart. Similarly, the normal propidium ion uptake induced by BzATP at the wild-type <el> P2X <le>(7) receptor was abolished by the two mutants. Confocal laser scanning microscopy indicated that in vitro ischemia of 12h duration increased the integration of <el> P2X <le>(7)-EGFP, but not of its two mutants, into the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells. Further, this ischemic stimulus facilitated the current response to BzATP in HEK293 cells permanently transfected with <el> P2X <le>(7) receptors. Finally, the fluorescence intensity per cell measured by flow cytometry and <el> P2X <le>(7) antibodies directed against an extracellular, but not an intracellular epitope of the receptor, were also increased. 
Red blood cell (RBC) parameters such as morphology, volume, refractive index, and <re> hemoglobin <er> content are of great importance for diagnostic purposes. Existing approaches require complicated calibration procedures and robust cell perturbation. As a result, reference values for normal RBC differ depending on the method used. We present a way for measuring parameters of intact individual RBCs by using digital holographic microscopy (<el> DHM <le>), a new interferometric and label-free technique with nanometric axial sensitivity. The results are compared with values achieved by conventional techniques for RBC of the same donor and previously published figures. A <el> DHM <le> equipped with a laser diode (lambda = 663 nm) was used to record holograms in an off-axis geometry. Measurements of both RBC refractive indices and volumes were achieved via monitoring the quantitative phase map of RBC by means of a sequential perfusion of two isotonic solutions with different refractive indices obtained by the use of Nycodenz (decoupling procedure). Volume of RBCs labeled by membrane dye Dil was analyzed by confocal microscopy. The mean cell volume (MCV), red blood cell distribution width (RDW), and mean cell <re> hemoglobin <er> concentration (MCHC) were also measured with an impedance volume analyzer. <el> DHM <le> yielded RBC refractive index n = 1.418 +/- 0.012, volume 83 +/- 14 fl, MCH = 29.9 pg, and MCHC 362 +/- 40 g/l. Erythrocyte MCV, MCH, and MCHC achieved by an impedance volume analyzer were 82 fl, 28.6 pg, and 349 g/l, respectively. Confocal microscopy yielded 91 +/- 17 fl for RBC volume. 
Hyperlipidemia may contribute to the pathogenesis of glomerular sclerosis. We therefore studied binding and uptake of low density lipoprotein (<el> LDL <le>) by cultured rat mesangial cells. In addition effects of <el> LDL <le> on PGE2 synthesis and cell <re> proliferation <er> were determined. At 4 degrees C mesangial cells bound [125I] <el> LDL <le> in a time- and concentration-dependent manner with half-maximal binding observed at 5 micrograms/ml of <el> LDL <le> protein. Binding was blocked by excess unlabeled <el> LDL <le> and by heparin. Uptake (binding plus internalization) of <el> LDL <le> at 37 degrees C markedly exceeded binding at 4 degrees C, continued to increase even with longer periods of incubation, and showed no saturability, consistent with uptake of <el> LDL <le> by mesangial cells. Further evidence for <el> LDL <le> uptake by mesangial cells was obtained by use of the fluorescent probe 1,1'-dioactadecyl-3,3,3', 3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate-labeled <el> LDL <le> (Dil-<el> LDL <le>). Incubation of mesangial cells with Dil-<el> LDL <le> at 37 degrees C showed positive fluorescence for all mesangial cells, indicating uptake of the Dil-<el> LDL <le>. <el> LDL <le> had a biphasic effect on mesangial cell <re> proliferation <er> as determined by [3H] thymidine incorporation. <el> LDL <le> at 10 micrograms/ml enhanced [3H] thymidine uptake modestly, but significantly, whereas a progressive and marked inhibition occurred at <el> LDL <le> concentration from 100 to 500 micrograms/ml. While <el> LDL <le> at 10 and 100 micrograms/ml significantly stimulated PGE2 production, inhibition of PGE2 by meclofenamate did not influence the effects of <el> LDL <le> on [3H] thymidine incorporation. 
Flowering is exquisitely regulated by both promotive and inhibitory factors. Molecular genetic studies with Arabidopsis have verified several epigenetic repressors that regulate <re> flowering <er> time. However, the roles of chromatin remodeling factors in developmental processes have not been well explored in Oryza sativa (rice). We identified a chromatin remodeling factor <el> OsVIL2 <le> (O. sativa VIN3-LIKE 2) that promotes <re> flowering <er>. <el> OsVIL2 <le> contains a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, which is a conserved motif of histone binding proteins. Insertion mutations in <el> OsVIL2 <le> caused late <re> flowering <er> under both long and short days. In osvil2 mutants OsLFL1 expression was increased, but that of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 was reduced. We demonstrated that <el> OsVIL2 <le> is bound to native histone H3 in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that <el> OsVIL2 <le> was directly associated with OsLFL1 chromatin. We also observed that H3K27me3 was significantly enriched by OsLFL1 chromatin in the wild type, but that this enrichment was diminished in the osvil2 mutants. These results indicated that <el> OsVIL2 <le> epigenetically represses OsLFL1 expression. We showed that <el> OsVIL2 <le> physically interacts with OsEMF2b, a component of polycomb repression complex 2. As observed from osvil2, a null mutation of OsEMF2b caused late <re> flowering <er> by increasing OsLFL1 expression and decreasing Ehd1 expression. 
We have investigated the effect of <el> omega-PnTx3-3 <le> (referred to in previous papers simply as Tx3-3), a peptide toxin from the venom of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer, on neuronal high-voltage activated (<re> HVA <er>) Ca(2+) channels, using whole-cell patch-clamp. <el> omega-PnTx3-3 <le> (120 nM) blocked 74+/-8% of the total <re> HVA <er> Ca(2+) currents of cerebellar granule neurones, without affecting the low-voltage activated (LVA) current. P/Q/R-type currents in cerebellar granule neurones, isolated using 4 microM nicardipine and 100 nM omega-conotoxin GVIA, were markedly (79+/-6%) inhibited by 60 nM <el> omega-PnTx3-3 <le>. R-type currents, isolated either by additional application of 0.5-1 microM of omega-agatoxin IVA or by pre-incubation with 5 microM omega-conotoxin MVIIC were inhibited almost totally by 120 nM of <el> omega-PnTx3-3 <le>. <el> omega-PnTx3-3 <le> reversibly altered the kinetics of the P/Q/R current, increasing the degree of inactivation that occurred during a 50 ms pulse from 20% to 40%. N-type currents, recorded from neuroblastoma N18 cells, were partially (34+/-2%) inhibited by 320 nM <el> omega-PnTx3-3 <le>. L-type currents, recorded from GH3 cells, were partially (45+/-12%) inhibited by 80 nM <el> omega-PnTx3-3 <le>. 
Because S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) is required by Pneumocystis carinii in vitro, Pneumocystis infection depletes plasma AdoMet of rats and humans, <el> nicotine <le> reduces AdoMet of guinea pig lungs, and smoking correlates with reduced episodes of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in AIDS patients, we tested the effect of <el> nicotine <le> treatment on PCP using a rat model. Intraperitoneal infusion of 400 microg of R-(+) <el> nicotine <le> kg(-1) h(-1) intraperitoneal for 21 days caused a 15-fold reduction in lung AdoMet although neither plasma nor liver were changed. Infusion of 4 and 400 microg kg(-1) h(-1) into immunosuppressed rats, beginning when rats were inoculated with P. carinii, caused 85 and 99.88% reductions, respectively, in P. carinii cysts at sacrifice 21 days later; P. carinii nuclei were reduced by 91.2 and >99.99%, respectively. This effect was reversed by concomitant administration of AdoMet with <el> nicotine <le>. Treatment with AdoMet alone increased infection intensity. We conclude that AdoMet is a critical and limiting nutrient for Pneumocystis thus can serve as a therapeutic target for PCP. Regarding the mechanism, <el> nicotine <le> treatment caused no change in rat lung activity of AdoMet synthesizing methionine ATP transferase activity nor was there any evidence of increased AdoMet utilization for methylation reactions. Except of a doubling of putrescine, <el> nicotine <le> treatment also did not change lung <re> polyamine <er> content. However, key <re> polyamine <er> anabolic and catabolic enzymes were upregulated, and there were corresponding changes in <re> polyamine <er> metabolic intermediates. 
Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a major cause of vision loss in many retinal diseases. Hypoxia is determined to be a key inducer of CNV and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (<el> HIF-1 <le>) is an important transcription factor. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the synthesis of proangiogenic cytokines make great contributions to the development of CNV. In the present study, the role of <el> HIF-1 <le>α signaling in the regulation of angiogenin (ANG) expression and EMT in hypoxic retinal pigment epithelial cells was investigated. A significant elevation <re> expression of ANG <er> expression level in a mouse model of laser-induced CNV was demonstrated. In a hypoxic model of ARPE-19, an increased expression level of ANG and induction of EMT accompanied with stabilization and nucleus translocation of <el> HIF-1 <le>α. Blockage of <el> HIF-1 <le>α signaling resulted in inhibition of high <re> expression of ANG <er> and EMT features. The direct interaction between <el> HIF-1 <le>α and ANG promoter region was identified by ChIP-qPCR. The association of RNase 4 mRNA level with <el> HIF-1 <le>α signaling was also clarified in APRE-19. Moreover, the exogenous ANG translocated into the nucleus, enhanced 45S rRNA transcription, promoted cell proliferation and tube formation in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells. 
Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) secreted from jejunal mucosal K cells augments insulin secretion and plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of obesity and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. In recent studies, we have shown GIP directly activates Na-glucose cotransporter-1 (SGLT1) and enhances glucose absorption in mouse jejunum. It is not known whether GIP would also regulate other intestinal nutrient absorptive processes. The present study investigated the effect of GIP on proton-peptide cotransporter-1 (<re> PepT1 <er>) that mediates di- and tripeptide absorption as well as peptidomimetic drugs. Immunohistochemistry studies localized both GIP receptor (GIPR) and <re> PepT1 <er> proteins on the basolateral and apical membranes of normal mouse jejunum, respectively. Anti-GIPR antibody detected 50-, 55-, 65-, and 70-kDa proteins, whereas anti-<re> PepT1 <er> detected a 70-kDa proteins in mucosal homogenates of mouse jejunum. RT-PCR analyses established the expression of GIPR- and <re> PepT1 <er>-specific mRNA in mucosal cells of mouse jejunum. Absorption of Gly-Sar (a nondigestible dipeptide) measured under voltage-clamp conditions revealed that the imposed mucosal H(+) gradient-enhanced Gly-Sar absorption as an evidence for the presence of <re> PepT1 <er>-mediated H(+):Gly-Sar cotransport on the apical membranes of mouse jejunum. H(+):Gly-Sar absorption was completely inhibited by cephalexin (a competitive inhibitor of <re> PepT1 <er>) and was activated by GIP. The GIP-activated Gly-Sar absorption was completely inhibited by RP-<el> cAMP <le> (a <el> cAMP <le> antagonist). In contrast to GIP, the ileal L cell secreting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) did not affect the H(+):Gly-Sar absorption in mouse jejunum. 
Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (<el> TNF <le>), an inflammatory cytokine, has a potentially important role in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma and may contribute to airway hyper-responsiveness. Recent evidence has revealed that <el> TNF <le> can increase the Ca(2+) sensitivity of agonist-stimulated myosin light chain(20) (MLC(20)) phosphorylation and contractility in guinea pig airway smooth muscle (ASM). In the present study, the potential intracellular pathways responsible for this <el> TNF <le>-induced Ca(2+) sensitization were investigated. In permeabilized cultured guinea pig ASM cells, recombinant human <el> TNF <le> stimulated an increase in Ca(2+)-activated MLC(20) phosphorylation under Ca(2+) "clamp" conditions. This increased MLC(20) phosphorylation was inhibited by preincubation with the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y27632. <el> TNF <le> also increased the proportion of GTP-bound <re> RhoA <er>, as measured using rhotekin Rho-binding domain, in a time course compatible with a role in the <el> TNF <le>-induced Ca(2+) sensitization. In cultured human ASM cells, recombinant human <el> TNF <le> also activated <re> RhoA <er> with a similar time course. In addition, <el> TNF <le> stimulated phosphorylation of the regulatory subunit of the myosin phosphatase, which was inhibited by Y27632. Although human ASM cells expressed both receptor subtypes, <el> TNF <le>-R1 and <el> TNF <le>-R2, the activation of <re> RhoA <er> was predominantly via stimulation of the <el> TNF <le>-R1, although <re> RhoA <er> did not immunoprecipitate with the <el> TNF <le>-R1. 
The effects of physiological doses of human calcitonin (HCT) on renal excretion and tubular transport of water and electrolytes were investigated in hormone-deprived rats, i.e., homozygous DI Brattleboro rats with reduced levels of circulating glucagon, parathyroid hormone, and thyrocalcitonin, as these hormones are believed, together with ADH, to stimulate the same cells of the thick ascending limb. The experimental design was similar to the one used in a preceding study aimed at determining the effects of ADH in hormone-deprived rats [C. de Rouffignac et al. Am. J. Physiol. 244 (Renal Fluid Electrolyte Physiol. 13): F156-F164, 1983]. In the present experiments, HCT consistently increased the reabsorption of <re> Mg <er>, Ca, and K and, to a lesser extent, Na and <el> Cl <le> in the loop of Henle, but phosphate transport did not rise. The urinary excretion rate of <re> Mg <er> and Ca fell significantly. These data are very similar to the findings obtained with ADH on hormone-deprived rats. 
The group of "high ceiling" diuretics consists of a variety of chemically different potent diuretic and saluretic substances. Appart from a few exemptions direct evidence for an action of these substances in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (TAL) is still lacking. For furosemide, we have reported recently that it inhibits most likely the <re> Na+-2 Cl--K+ cotransport <er> system present in the lumen membrane of the TAL. The present study tests: 1. whether other "high ceiling" diuretics have a similar site and mode of action, and 2. how modifications of the furosemide molecule alter the inhibitory potency. Isolated cortical TAL (cTAL) segments (n = 185) of rabbit kidneys were perfused in vitro. The equivalent short circuit current (Isc = transepithelial PD/transepithelial resistance), as a measure of active salt transport was correlated to the dose of 64 substances. Several diuretics, such as 2-aminomethyl-4-(1,1-dimethyl-ethyl)-6-iodophenol hydrochloride (MK 447), hydrochlorothiazide, muzolimine, etozoline, tizolimide, amiloride, and triamterene were ineffective both from the lumen and basolateral side at concentrations as high as 10(-4) - 10(-3) mol X 1(-1). The phenoxyacetic acids ethacrynic acid, indacrinone (MK 196), and to less an extend tienilic acid were inhibitory active. They differed from furosemide in one or more of the following criteria: delayed onset, incomplete reversibility, stronger action from the bath, different slope of the dose response curve. Similarly, 1-ozolinone acted stronger from the bath. In contrast, the diuretics of the furosemide <el> type <le> and related compounds (bumetanide and piretanide) showed rapid onset and complete reversibility of inhibition. These substances acted stronger from the lumen. The individual positions in the benzyl ring of the diuretics were differently affected by substitutions, leading to parallel shifts in the dose response curves with halfmaximal inhibition at concentrations ranging between 8 X 10(-8) to greater than 10(-4) mol X 1(-1). For these substances the calculated Hill coefficients were close to unity: 0.96 +/- 0.05. 
Clinical evidence suggests that atypical antipsychotic drugs might reduce <re> alcohol <er> drinking and help to maintain abstinence. This study aimed to compare the effects of two widely used atypical antipsychotic drugs clozapine and <el> olanzapine <le> on <re> alcohol <er> intake in <re> alcohol <er>-preferring AA (Alko, Alcohol) rats that were taught to drink 10% <re> alcohol <er> in a 4 h limited access paradigm. Effects of acute clozapine (0, 0.3, 1.0 and 5.0 mg/kg) and <el> olanzapine <le> (0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1.25 mg/kg) treatments on the limited access <re> alcohol <er> drinking were studied. In repeated treatment experiment, clozapine (1.0 mg/kg) or <el> olanzapine <le> (0.5 mg/kg) was administered once daily, before limited access <re> alcohol <er> drinking session, over 5 successive days. To reveal any effect of the drugs selective for <re> alcohol <er> drinking, <re> alcohol <er> was exchanged with 0.1% saccharin solution for the 4 h limited access, and acute treatments were repeated. Effects of the drugs on ambulatory locomotor activity were tested with doses that were used in the acute experiments. Acute clozapine treatment had no effect on either <re> alcohol <er> or saccharin drinking, but <el> olanzapine <le> significantly reduced 4 h <re> alcohol <er> drinking. Repeated <el> olanzapine <le> treatment significantly reduced 4 h <re> alcohol <er> drinking when compared with vehicle or clozapine, but a tolerance developed to this effect. Repeated clozapine treatment produced no significant effect compared with vehicle. Both drugs significantly reduced locomotor activity. 
We have previously shown that the absence of <el> Fas <le>/<el> Fas <le> ligand significantly reduced tissue damage and intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) <re> apoptosis <er> in an in vivo model of T cell-mediated enteropathy. This enteropathy was more severe in IL-10-deficient mice, and this was associated with increased serum levels of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha and an increase in <el> Fas <le> expression on IECs. In this study, we investigated the potential of IL-10 to directly influence <el> Fas <le> expression and <el> Fas <le>-induced IEC <re> apoptosis <er>. Mouse intestinal epithelial cell lines MODE-K and IEC4.1 were cultured with IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, or anti-<el> Fas <le> monoclonal antibody (mAb) in the presence or absence of IL-10. <el> Fas <le> expression and <re> apoptosis <er> were determined by FACScan analysis of phycoerythrin-anti-<el> Fas <le> mAb staining and annexin V staining, respectively. Treatment with a combination of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha induced significant <re> apoptosis <er>. Anti-<el> Fas <le> mAb alone did not induce much <re> apoptosis <er> unless cells were pretreated with IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. These IECs constitutively expressed low levels of <el> Fas <le>, which significantly increased by preincubation of the cells with IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. Treatment with cytokine or cytokine plus anti-<el> Fas <le> mAb increased <re> apoptosis <er>, which correlated with a decreased <el> Fas <le>-associated death domain IL-1-converting enzyme-like inhibitory protein (FLIP) level, increased caspase-8 activity, and subsequently increased caspase-3 activity. IL-10 diminished both cytokine- and anti-<el> Fas <le> mAb-induced <re> apoptosis <er>, and this was correlated with decreased cytokine-induced <el> Fas <le> expression, increased FLIP, and decreased caspase-8 and caspase-3 activity. 
The influence of <el> Ca <le> supplementation of the usual diet for 14 d on biochemical markers of bone turnover was investigated in healthy young adults aged 21-26 years. In a crossover study, eighteen subjects (five male and thirteen female) were randomly assigned to their self-selected diet (about 22 mmol <el> Ca <le>/d) or their self-selected diet with a 20 mmol/d <el> Ca <le> supplement (about 40 mmol <el> Ca <le>/d) for 14 d followed by crossover to the alternative diet for a further 14 d. During each dietary period fasting morning first void urine samples (last 3 d) and fasting blood serum samples (morning of twelfth day) were collected. <el> Ca <le> supplementation reduced urinary excretion of pyridinoline (14%) and deoxypyridinoline (16%) (biochemical markers of <re> bone resorption <er>) but had no effect on biochemical markers of bone formation (serum osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase; EC 3.1.3.1). 
Although <el> aspirin <le> is cardioprotective in high-risk populations, many with diabetes mellitus (DM) are unresponsive to these benefits. We questioned whether cardiovascular unresponsiveness might be demonstrated by lack of <el> aspirin <le> sensitivity to in vitro platelet functions especially in subjects with poorly controlled diabetes. Six women and 4 men (48+/-8 years [mean+/-S.D.]), selected for poor control (glycohemoglobin 11.9+/-2.2%) and 10 sex-age (+/-5 years) matched controls received 81 mg <el> aspirin <le> daily. There was a 2-week washout from <el> aspirin <le> and related drugs. After the <el> aspirin <le> dose on day-7, blood for platelet aggregation assays, and 24-h urine for 2,3 dinor thromboxane B2 (<re> TxB2 <er>) and 2,3 dinor 6-keto (PGF1alpha) were obtained. Aspirin sensitivity was defined as inhibition (i.e., lower than expected) platelet aggregation after exposure to an agonist. Those with diabetes and controls were sensitive to <el> aspirin <le> inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by 1.6 mM arachidonic acid (9.5+/-3.9% versus 9.1+/-3.1%, normal range 40-100%) and by 0.83 microg/mL collagen (17.4+/-13.9% versus 13.2+/-9.3%, normal range 60-93%), respectively. Aspirin sensitivity to 2 microM ADP was present in five with diabetes and five controls. Urinary prostaglandin metabolites were suppressed below reference ranges, without differences between those with DM or controls for <re> TxB2 <er> (350+/-149 pg/mg versus 348+/-93 pg/mg creatinine) and PGF1alpha (255+/-104 pg/mg versus 222+/-88 pg/mg creatinine). 
Stabilizing mast cells (MCs) can either inhibit or augment inflammation; however, how improved therapeutic benefits against small intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IIRI) can be achieved by stabilizing MCs remains to be elucidated. The present study was designed to evaluate different treatments with cromolyn sodium (<el> CS <le>, an MC stabilizer), which was administrated either prior to ischemia or after reperfusion. Kunming mice were randomized into a sham-operated group (SH), a sole IIR group (M), in which mice were subjected to 30 min superior mesenteric artery occlusion followed by 3 day or 3 h reperfusion, or IIR, treated with <el> CS <le> 15 min prior to ischemia or 15 min after reperfusion in the PreCr and PostCr groups. The survival rate and Chiu's scores were evaluated. The levels of <re> ET-1 <er>, histamine, TNF-α and IL-6, and expression of MC protease 7 (MCP7), MC counts and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were quantified. IIR resulted in severe injury as demonstrated by significant increases in mortality and injury score. IIR also led to substantial elevations in the levels of <re> ET-1 <er>, histamine, TNF-α and IL-6, expression of MCP7, MC counts and MPO activities (P<0.05, M vs. SH groups). All biochemical changes were markedly reduced in the PostCr group (P<0.05, PostCr vs. M groups), whereas pretreatment of IIR mice with <el> CS <le> prior to ischemia exhibited no changes of <re> ET-1 <er> levels, injury score and inflammation (P>0.05, PreCr vs. M groups). 
Thirty-three patients with severe head trauma were studied to determine whether the use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) would cause an increase in intracranial pressure (<re> ICP <er>). Changes in <re> ICP <er> induced by PEEP were then correlated with a panel of physiological variables to try to explain these changes. Mean <re> ICP <er> increased from 13.2 +/- 7.7 mm Hg (+/- standard deviation) to 14.5 +/- 7.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.005) due to 10 <el> cm H2O PEEP <le>, but the eight patients with elevated baseline <re> ICP <er> experienced no significant increase. Cardiac output and venous admixture (Qs/Qt) declined significantly, while central venous pressure, peak inspiratory pressure, functional residual capacity, and arterial pCO2 increased significantly due to PEEP. Blood pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure were unchanged. The change in <re> ICP <er> due to PEEP correlated significantly with a combination of cardiac output, peak inspiratory pressure, Qs/Qt, and changes in blood pressure and arterial pCO2 due to PEEP, indicating that the effect of PEEP on <re> ICP <er> could be largely explained by its effect on hemodynamic and respiratory variables. No patient deteriorated clinically due to PEEP. 
In an attempt to differentiate among joint effusion, synovitis, pannus, and subchondral sclerosis in patients with clinically proved chronic rheumatoid arthritis, we used <el> gadopentetate dimeglumine <le>-enhanced <re> MR <er> imaging to examine 23 patients with acute knee symptoms. All patients had had rheumatoid arthritis for more than 6 months and satisfied four or more of the criteria of the American Rheumatism Association for rheumatoid arthritis. <re> MR <er> imaging was performed on a 1.5-T machine by using unenhanced T1-weighted spin-echo imaging, unenhanced T2*-weighted gradient-echo imaging, and unenhanced and enhanced T1-weighted gradient-echo imaging. Signal intensities of the synovium and bone marrow were measured with the region-of-interest technique on unenhanced and enhanced T1-weighted gradient-echo scans. Conventional radiographs were available for each patient. Joint effusion, synovitis, intraarticular pannus, subchondral sclerosis, and subchondral pannus had the same signal intensities on unenhanced T1-weighted spin-echo, unenhanced T1-weighted gradient-echo, and unenhanced T2*-weighted gradient-echo <re> MR <er> images, and could not be differentiated from one another. On enhanced T1-weighted gradient-echo sequences, pannus and synovitis showed marked enhancement in 15 patients, whereas joint effusion and sclerosis did not. Synovitis was diagnosed if the synovial membrane showed high enhancement; pannus was diagnosed if enhancing masses were seen within the joint space or in the subchondral area. In eight of the 23 joints, there was no enhancement of the synovium or intraarticular or subchondral tissue. 
This study examined the effects of the metabolic inhibitors <el> rotenone <le> and antimycin A on oxidative metabolism and <re> transport <er> in the proximal renal tubule of the rabbit. Measurements of oxygen consumption rate (QO2), cellular ATP content, and mitochondrial NAD redox state were made in suspensions of renal cortical tubules. Parallel experiments were conducted in isolated perfused proximal convoluted tubules to measure the absorption rates of fluid (Jv), phosphate (JlbPO4), and glucose (JlbGlc). The results indicate that <el> rotenone <le> and antimycin A, at doses (10(-6) M) that maximally inhibited mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, abolished net fluid and phosphate absorption and nearly eliminated net glucose <re> transport <er>. Partial inhibition of oxidative metabolism with 10(-7) M <el> rotenone <le> caused proportional reductions in QO2, ATP content, and Jv; however, JlbPO4 was reduced more markedly than either Jv or JlbGlc. 
Endothelial dysfunction is a typical characteristic of <el> sepsis <le>. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is important for maintaining endothelial function. Our previous study reported that the <re> NLRP3 <er> inflammasome promoted endothelial dysfunction by enhancing inflammation. However, the effects of <re> NLRP3 <er> on eNOS require further investigation. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the role of <re> NLRP3 <er> on eNOS expression levels in cecal ligation and puncture-induced impaired endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation and to determine the protective effects of melatonin. eNOS expression levels were discovered to be downregulated in the mesenteric arteries of <el> sepsis <le> model mice. Inhibiting <re> NLRP3 <er> with 10 mg/ kg MCC950 or inhibiting IL-1β with 100 mg diacerein rescued the eNOS expression and improved endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation. In vitro, IL-1β stimulation downregulated eNOS expression levels in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, while pretreatment with 1 µM of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 reversed this effect. In addition, treatment with 10 mg/kg MG132 also prevented the proteolysis of eNOS and improved endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation in vivo. Notably, treatment with 30 mg/kg melatonin downregulated <re> NLRP3 <er> expression levels and decreased IL-1β secretion, subsequently increasing the expression of eNOS and improving endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation. 
The biologically active metabolite of vitamin D3, 1,25 (OH)2 D3, exerts important immunoregulatory effects in addition to being a central mediator of calcium/phosphate metabolism. Utilizing an interleukin 1 responsive murine T cell line and 125I-interleukin 1 alpha, we show that 1,25 (OH)2 D3 (5,50 nM) enhanced 125I-interleukin 1 alpha binding up to almost 2-fold over control. This 1,25 (OH)2 D3 effect occurred in a dose-dependent manner and was detectable after 24 h but not before 7 h of culture. Scatchard analysis of 125I-interleukin 1 alpha binding data demonstrated that 1,25 (OH)2 D3 enhanced interleukin 1 receptor number without a significant change in affinity. The biologically less potent metabolite of vitamin D3, 25 (OH) D3, also augmented 125I-interleukin 1 alpha binding but at <el> steroid <le> levels 2-3 log orders greater than 1,25 (OH)2 D3. This observation, combined with the presence of high-affinity 3H-1,25 (OH)2 D3 receptors (88 sites/cell, K = 0.45 nM) in cytosolic extracts, strongly suggests that the nuclear vitamin D receptor mediates this <el> steroid <le>'s effect on <re> interleukin 1 receptor expression <er>. 
T cell subsets were analyzed in 33 patients with advanced cancer who were treated with either of two interferon preparations: a partially purified human leukocyte interferon (HulFN-alpha (Le] and a highly purified recombinant interferon (<el> lFLrA <le>). Included in the <el> lFLrA <le>-treated group were eight patients with immunodeficiency and Kaposi's sarcoma. The OKT4<re> +/OKT8+ <er> ratio was used to define the balance between helper/inducer and suppressor/cytotoxic T cell subsets. With both interferon preparations, the mean OKT4<re> +/OKT8+ <er> ratio decreased 24 hours after the first interferon dose. Within the HulFN-alpha (Le) group, the decrease in ratio was related to an increase in OKT8+ cells; in the <el> lFLrA <le> group, it was accompanied by a small decrease in the proportion of OKT4+ cells that was greater than the decrease in OKT8+ cells. Patients treated with <el> lFLrA <le> were followed for the first three weeks of therapy. Most patients treated with <el> lFLrA <le> at all dose levels, ranging from 1 X 10(6) to 54 X 10(6) units per day, had a decrease in OKT4<re> +/OKT8+ <er> ratio on Day 1. No substantial change in the ratio was observed on Days 7, 14, and 22. Patients with immunodeficiency and Kaposi's sarcoma had responses similar to those of patients with other cancers treated with <el> lFLrA <le>. 
Administration of troleandomycin (0.5 mmol.kg-1 p.o. daily for 5 days) decreased by 61% and 36%, respectively, the estradiol and <re> ethinylestradiol <er> 2/4-hydroxylase activities of hepatic microsomes from male Sprague-Dawley rats killed 2 hr after the last dose. This decrease did not appear to be due to the in vivo formation of the inactive cytochrome P-450 p Fe(II)-metabolite complex, since disruption of this complex with potassium ferricyanide did not increase estrogen hydroxylase activities. Troleandomycin administration, however, essentially suppressed cytochrome P-450 UT-A (one of the P-450 forms involved in the hydroxylation of estrogens) and resulted in the appearance of cytochrome P-450 forms whose estradiol hydroxylase activity was inhibitable by troleandomycin in vitro. Similarly, troleandomycin (2 mM) inhibited by 60% estradiol and <re> ethinylestradiol <er> 2/4-hydroxylase activities in microsomes from dexamethasone-treated rats, although it had no inhibitory effect in microsomes from control rats. In contrast, <el> erythromycin <le> and roxithromycin (2 mM) exerted no inhibitory effect, even in microsomes from dexamethasone-treated rats. In vivo, these macrolides (0.5 mmol.kg-1 p.o. daily for 5 days) decreased moderately cytochrome P-450 UT-A levels and estradiol 2/4-hydroxylase activity, and did not modify <re> ethinylestradiol <er> 2/4-hydroxylase activity. 
The two objectives of this study were to investigate <re> beta-carotene <er> 15,15'-dioxygenase activity in human tissues and to determine the effect of <el> desferrioxamine <le> on the dioxygenase activity. Two human in vitro models were used: the TC7 clone of the intestinal cell line Caco-2 and small intestinal mucosa preparations. beta-Carotene 15,15'-dioxygenase activity in the small intestinal mucosa was (mean +/- SD) 97.4 +/- 39.8 pmol/h.mg protein for five adults (44-89 y) and 20 pmol/h.mg for an infant (17 months). No activity was detected in adult stomach tissue. We report for the first time the dioxygenase activity in human liver: 62 pmol/h.mg for a normal adult liver and 7 pmol/h.mg for a liver exhibiting gross pathology. The maximum capacity of <re> beta-carotene <er> cleavage in an adult was estimated to be 12 mg/day (one fifth by small intestine and four fifths by liver), assuming an optimal <re> beta-carotene <er>/retinal cleavage ratio of 1:2. The dioxygenase activity was decreased up to 80% with increasing <el> desferrioxamine <le> concentrations in the two in vitro models. Desferrioxamine was characterized as a noncompetitive inhibitor. In TC7 cells, the inhibitory effect of <el> desferrioxamine <le> was reversed by iron addition, suggesting that this effect was related to the ability of <el> desferrioxamine <le> to chelate iron, purported to be an obligate cofactor of the enzyme. 
The Treatment Priority Index (<el> TPI <le>) is an epidemiologic tool used to rank <re> malocclusions <er> and assess the need for orthodontic treatment. The purpose of this study was to (1) evaluate the predictability of the <el> TPI <le> as an indicator of malocclusion severity, (2) evaluate the effect of orthodontic treatment on <el> TPI <le> values, and (3) compare the results with a national survey of American children aged 6 to 11 years and 12 to 17 years conducted by the United States Public Health Service. The <el> TPI <le> was recorded annually in a young student population of Juniata County, Pa., from 1975 to 1979, and later in 1985. The mean values of the <el> TPI <le> did not reflect the range of severity in the population. For this reason the Malocclusion Severity Scale (Burlington Growth Center) was used to identify four groups in 1985. Each group was tracked back to 1975. Further evaluation investigated the role of individual factors contributing to malocclusion over time (tooth displacement and occlusal factors). 
Investigation of the mechanisms of <re> arrhythmia <er> genesis and maintenance has benefited from the use of optical mapping techniques that employ excitation-contraction uncouplers. We investigated the effects of the excitation-contraction uncouplers 2,3-butanedione monoxime (<el> BDM <le>) and cytochalasin D (Cyto D) on the induction and maintenance of <re> arrhythmia <er> by electric shocks. Electrical activity was optically mapped from anterior epicardium of rabbit hearts (n = 9) during shocks (-100 V, 8 ms) applied from a ventricular lead at various phases of action potential duration (APD). Restitution curves were obtained using S1-S2 protocol and measurement of APD values at 70% of repolarization. Compared with Cyto D, <el> BDM <le> significantly shortened APD at 90% of repolarization, although no significant difference in dispersion of repolarization was observed. Wavelength was also shortened with <el> BDM <le>. In general, shock-induced <re> arrhythmia <er>s with <el> BDM <le> and Cyto D were ventricular tachycardic in nature. With respect to shock-induced sustained <re> arrhythmia <er>s, the vulnerable window was wider and the incidence was higher with <el> BDM <le> than with Cyto D. There was also a difference in the morphology of ventricular tachycardia (VT) between the two agents. The <re> arrhythmia <er>s with <el> BDM <le> usually resembled monomorphic VT, especially those that lasted >30 s. In contrast, <re> arrhythmia <er>s with Cyto D more resembled polymorphic VT. However, the average number of phase singularities increased under Cyto D vs. <el> BDM <le>, whereas no significant difference in the dominant frequency of shock-induced sustained <re> arrhythmia <er> was observed. 
The <re> DREAM <er> (Dp/Retinoblastoma(Rb)-like/E2F/<el> MuvB <le>) transcriptional repressor complex acts as a gatekeeper of the mammalian cell cycle by establishing and maintaining cellular quiescence. How <re> DREAM <er>'s three functional components, the E2F-DP heterodimer, the Rb-like pocket protein, and the <el> MuvB <le> subcomplex, form and function at target gene promoters remains unknown. The current model invokes that the pocket protein links E2F-DP and <el> MuvB <le> and is essential for gene repression. We tested this model by assessing how the conserved yet less redundant <re> DREAM <er> system in Caenorhabditis elegans is affected by absence of the sole C. elegans pocket protein LIN-35. Using a LIN-35 protein null mutant, we analyzed the assembly of E2F-DP and <el> MuvB <le> at promoters that are bound by <re> DREAM <er> and the level of expression of those "<re> DREAM <er> target genes" in embryos. We report that LIN-35 indeed mediates the association of E2F-DP and <el> MuvB <le>, a function that stabilizes <re> DREAM <er> subunit occupancy at target genes. In the absence of LIN-35, the occupancy of E2F-DP and <el> MuvB <le> at most <re> DREAM <er> target genes decreases dramatically and many of those genes become upregulated. The retention of E2F-DP and <el> MuvB <le> at some target gene promoters in lin-35 null embryos allowed us to test their contribution to <re> DREAM <er> target gene repression. Depletion of <el> MuvB <le>, but not E2F-DP, in the sensitized lin-35 null background caused further upregulation of <re> DREAM <er> target genes. 
The effect of two different doses of thyrotrophic releasing hormone (<el> TRH <le>) upon the plasma levels of growth (<re> GH <er>) and thyroid hormones in both sex-linked dwarf (dw) and normal (Dw) broiler hens was determined. In normal hens, 1.5 and 24 microg <el> TRH <le>/kg increased the <re> GH <er> plasma concentrations after 15 min. Plasma concentrations of T3 increased significantly 1 h after <el> TRH <le> injection, whereas T4 concentration decreased after 2 following injection of 24 microg/kg <el> TRH <le>. In dwarf hens both doses of <el> TRH <le> increased the plasma concentrations of <re> GH <er> and the <re> GH <er> response lasted longer. However, <el> TRH <le> was ineffective in raising T3 and T4 levels. Saline-injected dwarf birds showed no differences in plasma T4 and T3 levels in comparison with normal hens. A smaller number of hepatic cGH receptors was found in dwarf hens, whereas the affinity of the hepatic <re> GH <er> receptor was not influenced by the genotype. 
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the frequent malignant tumors and has a high mortality-to-incidence ratio. Apolipoprotein M (<el> ApoM <le>), a lipoprotein superfamily member, is primarily bound to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. Our previous studies opined that <el> ApoM <le> crucially modulates CRC progression, but its role in CRC has not been elucidated. Here, lentivirus infection technology was used to overexpress <el> ApoM <le> in Caco-2 cells. Cell growth, <re> apoptosis <er> as well as clone formation assays were performed to explore the biological influences of <el> ApoM <le> in Caco-2 cells. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed via GeneChip microarrays and Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) along with Western blotting were applied to verify the results. Ribosomal protein S27a (RPS27A) expression in CRC and tumor-adjacent tissues was detected by qPCR, and its correlation with clinicopathologic characteristics was explored. Our results showed that <el> ApoM <le> overexpression could promote Caco-2 cell proliferation and inhibit <re> apoptosis <er>. The microarray evaluation uncovered 2671 genes, which were differentially expressed, including RPS27A. The qPCR as well as the Western blotting data showed that <el> ApoM <le> overexpression significantly increased the expression of RPS27A. Moreover, RPS27A expression was remarkably higher in CRC tissues in contrast with the tumor-adjacent tissues and was positively correlated with the <el> ApoM <le> level in tumor tissues, and higher RPS27A expression was associated with smaller tumors and lower T stage. Functional recovery experiments indicated that knockdown of RPS27A counteracted the <re> apoptosis <er> inhibition and clone formation promotion induced by <el> ApoM <le> overexpression in Caco-2 cells. 
Plant sources of omega-3 fatty acids (FA) are needed that can materially raise tissue levels of long-chain omega-3 FA [i.e., eicosapentaenoic acid (<re> EPA <er>; 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 20:6n-3)]. Stearidonic acid (<el> SDA <le>; 18:4n-3) is the delta-6 desaturase product of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n-3), and when fed to humans, increases red blood cell (RBC) content of <re> EPA <er> to a greater extent than does ALA. This study was undertaken to determine the dose-dependence and time course of the increase in the <re> EPA <er> and DHA content of the heart and RBC in dogs. Adult male Beagles were fed 21, 64, or 193 mg/kg of <el> SDA <le> in in their food daily for up to 12 weeks. Positive and negative controls were given <re> EPA <er> (43 mg/kg) or high oleic acid sunflower oil, respectively. The baseline <re> EPA <er> content of RBC was 0.38 +/- 0.03% which increased (P<0.01) in a dose-dependent manner, with the high dose of <el> SDA <le> and <re> EPA <er> achieving levels of 1.33 +/- 0.26 and 1.55. +/- 0.28%, respectively. In the heart, the content of <re> EPA <er> rose from 0.06 +/- 0.01 to 1.24 +/- 0.22% in the <re> EPA <er> group and to 0.81 +/- 0.32% in the high <el> SDA <le> group (both P<0.01). In both tissues, DHA did not change. Compared to dietary <re> EPA <er>, <el> SDA <le> was 20-23% as efficient in raising tissue <re> EPA <er> levels. 
The presence of nutrients in the small intestine slows gastric emptying and suppresses appetite and food intake; these effects are partly mediated by the release of gut hormones, including CCK. We investigated the hypothesis that the modulation of antropyloroduodenal motility, suppression of appetite, and stimulation of CCK and glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion by intraduodenal <re> fat <er> are dependent on triglyceride hydrolysis by <el> lipase <le>. Sixteen healthy, young, lean men were studied twice in double-blind, randomized, crossover fashion. Ratings for appetite-related sensations, antropyloroduodenal motility, and plasma CCK and glucagon-like peptide-1 concentrations were measured during a 120-min duodenal infusion of a triglyceride emulsion (2.8 kcal/min) on one day with, on the other day without, 120 mg tetrahydrolipstatin, a potent <el> lipase <le> inhibitor. Immediately after the duodenal <re> fat <er> infusion, food intake at a buffet lunch was quantified. Lipase inhibition with tetrahydrolipstatin was associated with reductions in tonic and phasic pyloric pressures, increased numbers of isolated antral and duodenal pressure waves, and stimulation of antropyloroduodenal pressure-wave sequences (all P < 0.05). Scores for prospective consumption and food intake at lunch were greater, and nausea scores were slightly less, and the rises in plasma CCK and glucagon-like peptide-1 were abolished (all P < 0.05). 
Periodontal (gum) disease is one of the main global oral health burdens and severe periodontal disease (periodontitis) is a leading cause of tooth loss in adults globally. It also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (<el> LPS <le>) is a key virulent attribute that significantly contributes to periodontal pathogenesis. Baicalin is a flavonoid from Scutellaria radix, an herb commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine for treating inflammatory diseases. The present study examined the modulatory effect of baicalin on P. gingivalis <el> LPS <le>-induced <re> expression of IL-6 and IL-8 <er> in human oral keratinocytes (HOKs). Cells were pre-treated with baicalin (0-80 µM) for 24 h, and subsequently treated with P. gingivalis <el> LPS <le> at 10 µg/ml with or without baicalin for 3 h. IL-6 and IL-8 transcripts and proteins were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. The expression of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) proteins was analyzed by western blot. A panel of genes related to toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling was examined by PCR array. We found that baicalin significantly downregulated P. gingivalis <el> LPS <le>-stimulated <re> expression of IL-6 and IL-8 <er>, and inhibited P. gingivalis <el> LPS <le>-activated NF-κB, p38 MAPK and JNK. Furthermore, baicalin markedly downregulated P. gingivalis <el> LPS <le>-induced expression of genes associated with TLR signaling. 
We have previously reported that a moderate dietary supplementation of 20% <el> fructose <le> but not glucose leads to a <re> salt <er>-sensitive hypertension related to increased proximal sodium-hydrogen exchanger activity and increased renal sodium retention. We also found that while high <re> salt <er> increased renal nitric oxide formation, this was retarded in the presence of <el> fructose <le> intake. We hypothesized that at least part of the pathway leading to <el> fructose <le>-induced <re> salt <er>-sensitive hypertension could be due to <el> fructose <le>-induced formation of reactive oxygen species and inappropriate stimulation of renin secretion, all of which would contribute to an increase in blood pressure. We found that both 20% <el> fructose <le> intake and a high-<re> salt <er> diet stimulated 8-isoprostane excretion. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic tempol significantly reduced this elevated excretion. Next, we placed rats on a high-<re> salt <er> diet (4%) for 1 week in combination with normal rat chow or 20% <el> fructose <le> with or without chronic tempol administration. A <el> fructose <le> plus high-<re> salt <er> diet induced a rapid increase (15 mmHg) in systolic blood pressure and reversed high <re> salt <er> suppression of plasma renin activity. Tempol treatment reversed the pressor response and restored high <re> salt <er> suppression of renin. 
We studied the value of vaginal progesterone (<el> P4 <le>) in suppressing serum <re> LH <er> concentrations and restoring normal luteal phase serum <re> LH <er> concentrations before administration of exogenous gonadotropins in anovulatory women with the polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). <el> P4 <le> (50 mg every 12 h) was administered by vaginal suppository to 9 women (18 cycles) for 14 days before ovulation induction with human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) and hCG. Serum <re> LH <er>, FSH, estradiol, <el> P4 <le>, and PRL levels were measured daily. A biphasic effect on <re> LH <er> secretion occurred during <el> P4 <le> administration. Peak serum <re> LH <er> levels occurred on day 5 (125% of basal levels; P less than 0.05) of vaginal <el> P4 <le> suppository use, followed by a progressive fall (P less than 0.05) to 79% of basal levels, but serum <re> LH <er> levels were still higher than those in normal women despite achieving physiological luteal phase <el> P4 <le> concentrations. Ovulation occurred in 56% of cycles after <el> P4 <le> and hMG/hCG treatment and in 65% of control cycles after hMG/hCG alone. In 7 women, serum <re> LH <er> was measured at 10-min intervals for 6 h before and after vaginal <el> P4 <le> administration for 10 days. <re> LH <er> pulse frequency decreased from 7.4 +/- 1.1 to 4.4 +/- 1.2 pulses/6 h (P less than 0.01), and <re> LH <er> pulse amplitude increased from 3.8 +/- 1.8 to 6.1 +/- 2.9 IU/L (P less than 0.01) after <el> P4 <le> administration. 
<el> GM-CSF <le> has been showed to be able to induce up-regulated receptor and cytokine expression in mast cells in inflammatory conditions. However, little is known of its effects on protease activated receptor (PAR) expression and Th2 cytokine secretion from mast cells. In the present study, we examined potential influence of <el> GM-CSF <le> on mast cell PAR expression and IL-4 and IL-10 release by using flow cytometry analysis, quantitative real time PCR, ELISA and cellular activation of signaling ELISA (CASE) techniques. The results showed that <el> GM-CSF <le> induced up to 3.0-fold increase in <re> IL-4 release <er> from P815 cells, and FSLLRY-NH(2) and trans-cinnamoyl (tc)-YPGKF-NH(2) did not affect <el> GM-CSF <le> induced <re> IL-4 release <er>. <el> GM-CSF <le> reduced tryptase and trypsin induced <re> IL-4 release <er> by up to approximately 55.8% and 70.3%, respectively. <el> GM-CSF <le> elicited the upregulated expression of PAR-1, PAR-2, PAR-3 and PAR-4 mRNAs, but enhanced only PAR-4 protein expression in P815 cells. U0126, PD98059 and LY204002 almost completely abolished <el> GM-CSF <le> induced <re> IL-4 release <er> when they were preincubated with P815 cells for 30 min, indicating ERK and Akt cell signaling pathways may be involved in the event. 
We administered Ro 40-7592, an inhibitor of the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (<el> COMT <le>) that crosses the blood-brain barrier, to rats and monitored extracellular catecholamine levels in the corpus striatum before and after the intraperitoneal administration of a bolus of <re> l-dopa <er>. Acute administration of Ro 40-7592 increased basal levels of <re> l-dopa <er> and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and decreased basal homovanillic acid (HVA) levels, but did not affect basal dopamine levels. In rats treated with Ro 40-7592, <re> l-dopa <er> administration produced a greater increase in striatal levels of <re> l-dopa <er>, dopamine, and DOPAC than it did in controls, while HVA formation was attenuated. 
Fifteen cows (87 +/- 8 d in lactation; 641 +/- 33 kg BW) were randomly assigned to treatment and then subjected for 182 d to daily sc injection (1000 hr), in the cervical area, of saline (control), thyrotropin-releasing factor (TRF: 1 micrograms/kg BW), growth hormone-releasing factor (1-29)NH2 (<el> GRF <le>; 10 micrograms/kg BW) or <el> GRF <le> plus TRF (10 and 1 micrograms/kg BW, respectively) according to a 2 x 2 factorial design. On days 1, 31, 88 and 179, jugular blood samples were collected from 2 hr before to 6 hr after injection. Samples were also collected for 5 consecutive days after cessation of treatment. <el> GRF <le> always induced growth hormone (GH) release (600 vs 7925 ng.min/ml) with augmentation of response with time (interaction <el> GRF <le> * day; P less than .001). TRF did not affect (P greater than .25) <re> GH release <er>; there was no interaction (P greater than .25) with time. There was no significant interaction (P greater than .25) between <el> GRF <le> and TRF on <re> GH release <er>. However, the amount of <re> GH release <er> with <el> GRF <le> plus TRF was always greater than with <el> GRF <le> alone (9419 vs 6431 ng.min/ml). TRF induced a significant release of prolactin (23769 vs 42175 ng.min/ml) but <el> GRF <le> reduced the amount of prolactin release on the last day of sampling. TRF induced thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) release only on the first day of injection while triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) continued to respond to TRF throughout the treatment period. Concentrations of T3 and T4 fell below control levels after cessation of TRF injection. 
More than 50% of adults and ~20% of children with pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) relapse following treatment. Dismal outcomes for patients with relapsed or refractory disease mandate novel approaches to therapy. We have previously shown that the combination of the mTOR inhibitor <el> RAD001 <le> (everolimus) and the chemotherapeutic agent vincristine increases the survival of non-obese diabetic/severe combined immuno-deficient (NOD/SCID) mice bearing human ALL xenografts. We have also shown that 16 μM <el> RAD001 <le> synergized with agents that cause DNA damage or microtubule disruption in pre-B ALL cells in vitro. Here, we demonstrate that <el> RAD001 <le> has dose-dependent effects on the cell cycle in ALL cells, with 1.5 μM <el> RAD001 <le> inhibiting pRb, Ki67 and PCNA expression and increasing G0/1 cell cycle arrest, whereas 16 μM <el> RAD001 <le> increases pRb, cyclin D1, Ki67 and PCNA, with no evidence of an accumulation of cells in G0/1. Transition from G2 into <re> mitosis <er> was promoted by 16 μM <el> RAD001 <le> with reduced phosphorylation of cdc2 in cells with 4 N DNA content. However, 16 μM <el> RAD001 <le> preferentially induced cell death in cells undergoing <re> mitosis <er>. When combined with vincristine, 16 μM <el> RAD001 <le> reduced the vincristine-induced accumulation of cells in <re> mitosis <er>, probably as a result of increased death in this population. Although 16 μM <el> RAD001 <le> weakly activated Chk1 and Chk2, it suppressed strong vincristine-induced activation of these cell cycle checkpoint regulators. 
Ursodeoxycholate (<el> UDC <le>)-induced HCO3- -rich choleresis may be due to activation of sinusoidal Na+-H+ exchange followed by an increase in intracellular pH (<re> pHi <er>) and HCO3- excretion via canalicular Cl- -HCO3- exchange. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effect of <el> UDC <le> and tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDC) on net H+ efflux from perfused rat livers and <re> pHi <er> in isolated hepatocytes in the presence and absence of amiloride. <el> UDC <le>-induced increases in biliary HCO3- concentration and excretion were inhibited by amiloride. However, these increases were temporally associated with an initial decline in H+ efflux and <re> pHi <er> followed by a gradual recovery toward base line. The initial decline in H+ efflux was associated with a rapid uptake of <el> UDC <le>. Amiloride inhibited only the recovery phases of H+ efflux and <re> pHi <er>. TUDC increased amiloride-sensitive H+ efflux without affecting biliary [HCO3-] and decreased <re> pHi <er> in the presence but not in the absence of amiloride. Amiloride decreased TUDC-induced choleresis and HCO3- excretion most likely by decreasing TUDC excretion. TUDC decreased biliary [Cl-] and increased hepatic O2 uptake more than <el> UDC <le>. 
Interaction and cross-talk of G-protein-coupled receptors (<el> GPCR <le>s) are of considerable interest because an increasing number of examples implicate a profound functional and physiological relevance of homo- or hetero-oligomeric <el> GPCR <le>s. The ghrelin (growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR)) and melanocortin-3 (MC3R) receptors are both known to have orexigenic effects on the hypothalamic control of <re> body weight <er>. Because in vitro studies indicate heterodimerization of GHSR and MC3R, we investigated their functional interplay. Combined in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry indicated that the vast majority of GHSR-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus also express MC3R. In vitro coexpression of MC3R and GHSR promoted enhanced melanocortin-induced intracellular cAMP accumulation compared with activation of MC3R in the absence of GHSR. In contrast, agonist-independent basal signaling activity and ghrelin-induced signaling of GHSR were impaired, most likely due to interaction with MC3R. By taking advantage of naturally occurring GHSR mutations and an inverse agonist for GHSR, we demonstrate that the observed enhanced MC3R signaling capability depends directly on the basal activity of GHSR. 
Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation is able to attenuate organ fibrosis; however, increasing evidence has indicated that MSCs may be an important cell source of myofibroblasts, which are vital pathogenic cells in fibrotic diseases. The results of the present study revealed that co‑culturing with exogenous transforming growth factor (TGF)‑β1 can induce the transdifferentiation of cultured rat MSCs into myofibroblasts in vitro. Treatment of the MSCs with tranilast [N‑(3',4'‑dimethoxycinnamoyl)‑anthranilic acid] attenuated this fibrotic process. Immunocytochemical staining, western blot analysis, reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and cell viability assays were performed in order to evaluate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of tranilast on <el> TGF‑β1 <le>‑mediated MSC‑to‑myofibroblast activation. The results demonstrated that <el> TGF‑β1 <le> upregulated the expression of α‑smooth muscle actin (α‑SMA) and collagen type I, and increased the phosphorylation of mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 (<re> Smad3 <er>) and extracellular signal‑regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in the rat MSCs; by contrast, tranilast pretreatment downregulated their expression. Furthermore, the proliferation of MSCs induced by <el> TGF‑β1 <le> was decreased by pretreatment with tranilast. 
Yeast is a good system for studying molecular mechanisms of metal tolerance. Using a mini-Tn mutagenized yeast pool, we isolated a chromate-tolerant mutant, <re> Cr <er>T9, that displayed metal-specific tolerance since it was only tolerant to <re> Cr <er>(VI), not to <re> Cr <er>(III), Cd, As, or Fe. The <re> Cr <er>-tolerance of <re> Cr <er>T9 appeared to be due to reduced <re> Cr <er> accumulation as it accumulated only 56% as much as WT (Y800). Using IPCR (inverse PCR), we found that the mini-Tn had been inserted at nt 741 of the <el> transcriptional activator <le>, MSN1. MSN1 is a multifunctional protein involved in invertase activity, iron uptake, starch degradation, pseudohyphal growth, and osmotic gene expression. We found that there was only one mini-Tn insertion in <re> Cr <er>T9 since MSN1 and mini-Tn probes hybridized to the same DNA fragment, and the MSN1 probe detected an enlarged MSN1 mRNA. When we over-expressed MSN1 in <re> Cr <er>T9 and WT, both accumulated larger amounts of <re> Cr <er>. 
Phenobarbital (PB) alters expression of numerous hepatic genes, including genes of cytochrome P450 2B1 and 2B2 (CYP2B). However, the intracellular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. The present study investigated the involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in rat hepatocytes in primary culture. We showed that PB induced an early, dose-dependent activation of <el> ERK <le> (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and p38 MAPKs. Regarding the PB (1mM) induction of CYP2B mRNA expression, while chemically inhibiting JNK had no effect, specific inhibitors of the <el> ERK <le> (U0-126) and p38 (SB-203580) pathways up- and down-regulated this expression, respectively. However, although such a regulation was confirmed when testing the effect of a dominant negative mutant of the <el> ERK <le> pathway on the <re> CYP2B2 enhancer-promoter <er> activity, no such transcriptional role was found with the p38 pathway. Moreover, upon arrest of transcription, the stability of CYP2B mRNA remained unaffected by SB-203580. 
Exposure to phosgene has been shown to cause severe and life-threatening pulmonary edema. There is evidence that successful treatment of phosgene-induced acute lung injury may be related to increased antioxidant activity. Acetylenic acids such as 5,8,11, 14-eicosatetraynoic acid (<el> ETYA <le>) have been shown to be effective in preventing pulmonary edema formation (PEF). In phosgene-exposed guinea pigs, we examined the effects of <el> ETYA <le> on PEF. Lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance, TBARS) and total glutathione (<re> GSH <er>) were measured in lung tissue from isolated, buffer-perfused guinea pig lungs at 180 min after start of exposure. Guinea pigs were challenged with 175 mg/m(3) (44 ppm) phosgene for 10 min (1750 mg( small middle dot)min/m(3)). Five minutes after removal from the exposure chamber, guinea pigs were treated, ip, with 200 microl of 100 microM <el> ETYA <le> in ethanol (ETOH). Two hundred microliters of 50 microM <el> ETYA <le> in ETOH was added to the 200 ml perfusate every 40 min beginning at 60 min after start of exposure (t = 0). There were four groups in this study: air-exposed, phosgene-exposed, phosgene + <el> ETYA <le>-posttreated, and air + <el> ETYA <le>-posttreated. Posttreatment with <el> ETYA <le> prevented <re> GSH <er> depletion, 2. 7 +/- 0.5 micromol/mg protein versus 1 +/- 0.2 micromol/mg protein, for the untreated phosgene-exposed lungs (p < or =.05). <el> ETYA <le> posttreatment also significantly decreased PEF (p </=.025), as measured by lung wet weight/dry weight ratio, 16.1 +/- 2.5 versus 8.5 +/- 1 for phosgene-exposed + <el> ETYA <le>-posttreated guinea pigs. Postexposure treatment with <el> ETYA <le> significantly increased the <re> GSH <er> to TBARS protection ratio, 12 +/- 2, compared with the phosgene-exposed group, 3.7 +/- 0.5 (p < or =.05). 
The combination of glucagon and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has been suggested as an approach to target obesity, since the two hormones have complementary action on body weight. We examined whether complementary action of the two hormones also exist on <re> insulin secretion <er>. Female C57BL/6 mice were injected intravenously with <el> glucose <le> with or without GLP-1, glucagon or the combination of GLP-1 and glucagon at three different dose levels. Furthermore, freshly isolated mouse islets were incubated for 30min in the presence of 2.8, 11.1 or 16.7mmol/l <el> glucose <le> or with 11.1mmol/l <el> glucose <le> in the presence of 100nmol/l glucagon and/or GLP-1. It was found that at 1min after <el> glucose <le> injection alone, insulin rose to a peak level and this peak, as well as the 50min area under the insulin curve (AUC insulin) were dose-dependently augmented by GLP-1 and glucagon. However, peak insulin with the two hormones together (with <el> glucose <le>) was not higher than after either single administration at any of the tested doses, i.e., no additive of synergistic action was observed by the combination on <el> glucose <le>-stimulated <re> insulin secretion <er>. Similar results were observed when calculating insulin for the whole test period. Also in vitro, both glucagon and GLP-1 augmented <re> insulin secretion <er>; however, there was no difference between the combined stimulation of <re> insulin secretion <er> by GLP-1 and glucagon together compared with either hormone alone. Insulin sensitivity did not exhibit significant changes from the <el> glucose <le> only condition. 
The polyphenolic flavonoid <el> Baicalein <le> has been shown to trigger suicidal <re> death <er> or apoptosis of tumor cells and is thus considered for the prevention and treatment of malignancy. Similar to apoptosis of nucleated cells, erythrocytes may enter eryptosis, the suicidal erythrocyte <re> death <er> characterized by cell shrinkage and cell membrane scrambling with phosphatidylserine translocation to the erythrocyte surface. Stimulators of eryptosis include increase of cytosolic Ca2+-activity ([Ca2+]i) and ceramide. The present study explored whether <el> Baicalein <le> stimulates eryptosis. To this end, forward scatter was taken for measurement of cell volume, annexin-V-binding for phosphatidylserine-exposure, Fluo3 fluorescence for [Ca2+]i and fluorescent antibodies for ceramide abundance. As a result, a 48 h exposure of human erythrocytes to <el> Baicalein <le> was followed by significant decrease of forward scatter (≥10 µM), significant increase of the percentage of annexin-V-binding cells (≥25 µM), significant increase of [Ca2+]i (50 µM) and significant increase of ceramide abundance (50 µM). The effect of <el> Baicalein <le> (50 µM) on annexin-V-binding was significantly blunted but not abrogated by removal of extracellular Ca2+. 
Cisplatin, a cytotoxic drug for the treatment of cancer, induces suicidal <re> death <er> or apoptosis of nucleated cells. Side effects of <el> cisplatin <le> include anemia, which, at least in theory, could similarly result from suicidal cell <re> death <er>. Erythrocyte suicidal <re> death <er> or eryptosis is characterized by cell shrinkage and cell membrane scrambling, the latter leading to exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) at the cell surface. PS-exposing cells are rapidly cleared from circulating blood. The present experiments explored whether <el> cisplatin <le> could trigger eryptosis. According to forward scatter in FACS analysis, a 48 h exposure to <el> cisplatin <le> (> or =1 microM) indeed decreased cell volume and, according to annexin V-binding, <el> cisplatin <le> (> or =1 microM, 48 h) indeed increased PS exposure at the cell surface. Cisplatin did not induce hemolysis. According to Fluo3 fluorescence, <el> cisplatin <le> increased cytosolic Ca2+ activity, a known stimulator of eryptosis. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, the effect of <el> cisplatin <le> on annexin V-binding was blunted. Cisplatin did not significantly modify the formation of ceramide, another stimulator of eryptosis. Cisplatin moderately decreased the cellular concentration of ATP, which is known to favour eryptosis. 
We determined whether <el> ACTH <le>1-24, infused into fetal lambs at a rate that is known to cause premature labor, elicits changes in the responsiveness of the fetal adrenal glands, and alters the pattern of <re> corticosteroid <er> output. Plasma cortisol (F), corticosterone (B) and progesterone (P4) were measured during 72 h of infusion of saline or <el> ACTH <le> (10 micrograms/h) beginning on Day 127 of pregnancy. Adrenals were then dispersed into isolated cells, and the output of F, B and P4 after exogenous <el> ACTH <le> determined in vitro. Plasma concentrations of F and B were higher in <el> ACTH <le>-treated fetuses. The increment in F (5-to 7-fold) was greater than that in B (2-fold) such that the F:B ratio in plasma of <el> ACTH <le>-treated fetuses on Days 2 and 3 of infusion was 2.5 times higher than in controls. After 72 h of infusion, the adrenal weights in <el> ACTH <le>-treated fetuses (741 +/- 38 mg, +/- SEM; n = 4) were greater than in the control animals (349 +/- 11 mg). There was a significant effect of <el> ACTH <le> pretreatment in vivo on F output by isolated adrenal cells in vitro. Mean increments in F output after addition of <el> ACTH <le>1-24 (5000 pg/ml) in vitro rose from 368 +/- 235 pg/50,000 cells in controls, to 64,639 +/- 19,875 pg/50,000 cells after <el> ACTH <le> in vivo. There was no significant effect of <el> ACTH <le> in vivo on B output in vitro; the ratio of F:B output, either in the absence or presence of <el> ACTH <le> in vitro, was significantly higher in cells from <el> ACTH <le>-pretreated fetuses. There was a significant effect of in vivo <el> ACTH <le> on in vitro P4 output. After <el> ACTH <le> treatment in vivo there was an increase in the vitro output ratio of F:P4, but no change in the output ratio of B:P4. 
Small G-proteins (SMGs) require isoprenylation for their association with membranes. We have examined protein isoprenylation, subcellular distribution of SMGs, cytosolic Ca2+ changes and <re> insulin secretion <er> in HIT-T15 cells after treatment with lovastatin, which inhibits the production of isoprenoids by blocking mevalonate production by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. Numerous proteins in the 20-70 kDa range were found to be isoprenylated. Most of these proteins co-migrated with SMGs (21-27 kDa). Lovastatin treatment (25 microM, 24 h) decreased protein isoprenylation and affected the distribution of several SMGs, causing a large accumulation in the cytosol and a detectable decrease in membranes. Lovastatin selectively attenuated the potentiating action of bombesin and <el> vasopressin <le>, which activate phospholipase C in these cells, on <re> insulin secretion <er> stimulated by nutrients (glucose + leucine + glutamine). This lovastatin effect was overcome by mevalonate. Insulin secretion stimulated by nutrients alone or insulin release in the presence of the potentiating agents forskolin or phorbol myristate acetate remained unaffected. As the modulation of <re> insulin secretion <er> by isoprenaline and somatostatin were not altered by lovastatin, the drug does not non-selectively affect the binding of ligands to their receptors. Lovastatin did not interfere with the activation of phospholipase C by bombesin and <el> vasopressin <le>, since the rise in cytosolic Ca2+ induced by these agents was not changed. Limonene, proposed to block specifically prenyl-protein transferases of SMGs, did not alter protein isoprenylation patterns, but inhibited the stimulated <re> insulin secretion <er>. 
In permeable human fibroblasts, novobiocin, coumermycin and <el> nalidixic acid <le> completely inhibit <re> u.v <er>.-induced DNA repair synthesis, with 50% inhibition occurring at 500, 24 and 8800 microM respectively. Novobiocin also inhibits damage-specific incision of DNA in <re> u.v <er>.-irradiated permeable human fibroblasts by at least 75%. It has been suggested that effects of novobiocin on DNA excision repair result from changes in ATP pools; this explanation is not applicable to our data because excision repair in the permeable cell system is entirely dependent on exogenous ATP. It has also been suggested that novobiocin-induced inhibition of repair is mediated by alterations of chromatin structure recognizable by electron microscopy as gross chromatin clumping. There were no ultrastructural alterations, however, in the nuclei of permeable cells that had been incubated with 1 mM novobiocin. 
Although studies have shown that saturated and polyunsaturated <el> <re> fat <er>s <le> can mediate plasma lipid and apolipoprotein (apo) concentrations at the mRNA level, there is little data on the role of monounsaturated <el> <re> fat <er>s <le>. We determined hepatic lipid and apo mRNA levels in 10 cynomolgus monkeys fed three diets that provided 30% of energy as <re> fat <er> with 0.1% cholesterol by weight and differed solely by the substitution of saturated, mono- and polyunsaturated <el> <re> fat <er>s <le> as 60% of total <re> fat <er> energy. Total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol, as well as LDL apo B, HDL apo A-I and HDL total apo C concentrations, were reduced with the mono- and polyunsaturated <re> fat <er> diets relative to the saturated <re> fat <er> diet. Although <re> fat <er> saturation did not significantly affect hepatic apo A-I, B, C-II, or E mRNA abundance, hepatic apo C-III mRNA concentrations were uniformly lower (-23%, P < 0.01) with the mono- and polyunsaturated <re> fat <er> diets than with the saturated <re> fat <er> diet. Interestingly, liver triglycerides were significantly elevated with the monounsaturated <re> fat <er> diet relative to the saturated <re> fat <er> diet, but no other differences in hepatic lipids were noted among diets. Hepatic triglyceride composition was shown to reflect dietary <re> fat <er>ty acid composition, with liver triglycerides enriched in myristic and palmitic <re> fat <er>ty acids during the saturated <re> fat <er> diet, oleic acid during the monounsaturated <re> fat <er> diet and linoleic acid during the polyunsaturated <re> fat <er> diet. 
In vertebrate cells, centromeres are specified epigenetically through the deposition of the centromere-specific histone CENP-A. Following CENP-A deposition, additional proteins are assembled on centromeric chromatin. However, it remains unknown whether additional epigenetic features of centromeric chromatin are required for <re> kinetochore assembly <er>. Here, we used ChIP-seq analysis to examine centromere-specific histone modifications at chicken centromeres, which lack highly repetitive sequences. We found that H4K20 monomethylation (<el> H4K20me1 <le>) is enriched at centromeres. Immunofluorescence and biochemical analyses revealed that <el> H4K20me1 <le> is present at all centromeres in chicken and human cells. Based on immunoprecipitation data, <el> H4K20me1 <le> occurs primarily on the histone H4 that is assembled as part of the CENP-A nucleosome following deposition of CENP-A into centromeres. Targeting the <el> H4K20me1 <le>-specific demethylase PHF8 to centromeres reduces the level of <el> H4K20me1 <le> at centromeres and results in <re> kinetochore assembly <er> defects. 
The aims of this study were to determine 1) whether endothelin (ET)-1 affects the neuronal activity of the <re> NTS <er> neurons, 2) whether specific ET receptor antagonists affect the neuronal activity of the <re> NTS <er> neurons, and 3) whether <el> ET-1 <le> or ET receptor antagonists modulate the responses of the nucleus of the solitary tract (<re> NTS <er>) neurons to L-glutamate (Glu). The single-unit discharge was extracellularly recorded with a fine electrode from medulla brain slice preparations of rats. <el> ET-1 <le> and Glu were iontophoretically applied to the recorded neuron. Both <el> ET-1 <le> and Glu increased the neuronal activity. The ETA receptor antagonist BQ-123 attenuated the basal neuronal activity. <el> ET-1 <le> augmented the magnitude of the increases in the neuronal activity evoked by Glu, and these responses were antagonized by BQ-123. 
Transcription of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in Vero cells was confined to the <re> synthesis <er> of parentally-derived mRNA (primary transcription) by the use of cycloheximide and/or a ts mutant, G41(IV), at a non-permissive temperature (40 degrees C). More transcripts accumulated in the presence of cycloheximide than in its absence. This so-called "cycloheximide effect" results from higher rates of virus transcription sustained for longer periods of time. The rate of VSV transcription initially increases linearly for 1 to 2 h after injection. Interferon reduces this rate (congruent to fourfold with 50 units/ml <el> interferon <le>) irrespective of the presence or absence of cycloheximide. The VSV mRNA transcripts synthesized in mock- or <el> interferon <le>-treated cells were equal in size and had an equivalent half-life of 17 h at 40 degrees C. It seems likely that once transcription is initiated in <el> interferon <le>-treated cells, it is completed successfully. 
Recent in vivo studies suggest that heme <el> Fe <le> causes proximal tubular lipid peroxidation and cytotoxicity, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of myoglobinuric (Mgb) acute renal failure. Because hydroxyl radical (.OH) scavengers [dimethylthiourea (DMTU), benzoate, mannitol] can mitigate this injury, it is postulated that .OH is a mediator of Mgb-induced renal damage. The present study has tested these hypotheses using an isolated rat proximal tubular segment (<re> PTS <er>) system. An equal mixture of <el> Fe <le>2+/<el> Fe <le>3+ (4 mM total), when added to <re> PTS <er>, caused marked cytotoxicity [as defined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release] and lipid peroxidation [assessed by malondialdehyde (MDA) increments]. <el> Fe <le>2+ or <el> Fe <le>3+ alone each induced massive MDA elevations, but only <el> Fe <le>2+ caused cytotoxicity. Although both DMTU and benzoate decreased LDH release during the <el> Fe <le>2+/<el> Fe <le>3+ challenge, mannitol and GSH did not, despite equivalent reductions in .OH (gauged by the salicylate trap method). GSH and catalase (but not DMTU, benzoate, or mannitol) decreased MDA concentrations, suggesting the <el> Fe <le>-driven lipid peroxidation was more H2O2 than .OH dependent. Deferoxamine totally blocked <el> Fe <le>-induced LDH release, even under conditions in which it caused an apparent increase in .OH generation. Mgb paradoxically protected against <el> Fe <le>-mediated <re> PTS <er> injury, an effect largely reproduced by albumin. 
Expression of the <re> FOX3 gene <er>, which encodes yeast peroxisomal 3-oxoacyl-coenzyme A thiolase, can be induced by oleate and repressed by glucose. Previously, we have shown that induction was mediated by an oleate response element. Just upstream of this element a negatively acting control region that mediated glucose repression was found. In order to study this negative control region, we carried out DNA-binding assays and analyzed phenotypes of mutations in this region and in the trans-acting factor CAR80, which is identical to UME6. DNA-binding assays showed that two multifunctional yeast proteins, <el> ABF1 <le> and RP-A, interacted with the negative control element independently of the transcriptional activity of the <re> FOX3 gene <er>. <el> ABF1 <le> and RP-A, the latter being identical to BUF, were able to bind to DNA independently of one another but also simultaneously. The phenotypes of mutations in either DNA-binding sites of <el> ABF1 <le>, RP-A, or both, which affected the DNA binding of these factors in vitro, indicated that these sites and the proteins that interact with them participate in glucose repression. The involvement of the RP-A site in glucose repression was further supported by our observation that the CAR80 gene product, which is required for repression mediated by the RP-A site, was essential for maintenance of glucose repression. In addition to the RP-A site in the FOX3 promoter, similar sequences were observed in other genes involved in peroxisomal function. RP-A proved to bind to all of these sequences, albeit with various affinities. 
Branchio-oto-renal (<re> BOR <er>) syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by variable clinical manifestations including branchial fistulae, preauricular pits, ear malformations, hearing impairment, and renal anomalies. <re> BOR <er> is caused by mutations in the genes <el> EYA1 <le> and SIX1. A Danish <re> BOR <er> family with five affected individuals in three generations was analyzed for mutations in all 17 exons of <el> EYA1 <le> using direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified genomic DNA. A novel splice-site mutation (IVS9+1 G>C) was detected in all affected family members but not in unaffected family members or in 96 controls. 
Cold ischemia/warm reperfusion (<el> CI/WR <le>) injury remains a problem in liver transplantation. The aim of the current study was to assess the utility of the pan-caspase inhibitor IDN-6556 on <el> CI/WR <le> injury during human liver transplantation. This report is a post hoc analysis of a Phase II, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, parallel group study. Subjects were assigned to four treatment groups: Group 1 (Organ storage/flush: Placebo-Recipient: Placebo); Group 2 (Organ storage/flush: 15 microg/mL-Recipient: Placebo); Group 3 (Organ storage/flush: 5 microg/mL-Recipient: 0.5 mg/kg); and Group 4 (Organ storage/flush: 15 microg/mL-Recipient: 0.5 mg/kg). Liver cell <re> apoptosis <er> was assessed by serum concentrations of the <re> apoptosis <er>-associated CK18Asp396 ('M30') neo-epitope, TUNEL assay and caspase 3/7 immunohistochemistry. Liver injury was assessed by serum AST/ALT determinations. Serum markers of liver cell <re> apoptosis <er> were reduced in all groups receiving drug as compared to placebo. However, TUNEL, caspase 3/7 positive cells and serum AST/ALT levels were only consistently reduced in Group 2 (drug exposed to organ only). This reduction in serum transaminases was significant and observed across the study. 
Gentamicin accumulates in proximal tubule lysosomes, increases their number, and changes their structure. An important lysosomal function is degradation of intracellular proteins. To evaluate the effect of <el> gentamicin <le> on this lysosomal function, we measured the activity of the key lysosomal proteinases, <re> cathepsin B <er> and L, in microdissected S1, S2, and S3 segments of rat proximal tubules by means of a fluorometric microassay. The cathepsin activities were decreased in S1 and S2 following one and four <el> gentamicin <le> injections of 100 mg/kg body weight. The lysosomal enzyme, acid phosphatase, was also measured and was not decreased by <el> gentamicin <le>. The urine excretion of cathepsins B and L was decreased after <el> gentamicin <le>. This excludes an increase in urinary loss of cathepsins as the cause of decreased tubule activity. Structural changes of the lysosomes per se were excluded as the factor responsible for the reduced cathepsin activity by demonstrating increased <re> cathepsin B <er> and L activity in proximal tubule segments from rats injected with dextran, since dextran induces an increase in number and size of proximal tubule lysosomes. 
Pulmonary microvascular pressures (<re> PMVP <er>) have important diagnostic and therapeutic implications when utilized to monitor pulmonary dysfunction after cardiopulmonary bypass. Elevations in <re> PMVP <er> may lead to interstitial pulmonary edema and right ventricular failure. This study evaluated the influence of <el> Dobutamine <le> on <re> PMVP <er> in a trial of 80 consecutive patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Forty patients were randomized to the <el> Dobutamine <le> study group and received 5 micrograms/kg/min of <el> Dobutamine <le> for 24 hours, starting at the completion of bypass. In the control group, patients received postoperative inotropic support as indicated (dopamine [n = 10] or amrinone [n = 6]) by the clinical situation. <re> PMVP <er> values were computed based on continuous hemodynamic monitoring at 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours. Preoperative demographic descriptors and operative variables were comparable between the two groups. Postoperative fluid requirements and nonpulmonary complications were also similar between groups. Upon completion of cardiopulmonary bypass, <re> PMVP <er> (mean +/- SD) were <re> PMVP <er> decreased over time in the <el> Dobutamine <le> group, while it did not change in the control group. Clinically mean time to extubation was reduced from 18 to 12 hours (p < 0.06) in the <el> Dobutamine <le> group. We conclude that in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass, the postoperative administration of <el> Dobutamine <le> significantly reduces the <re> PMVP <er>. This may reduce pulmonary interstitial edema and pulmonary complications. Upon completion of cardiopulmonary bypass, <re> PMVP <er> (mean +/- SD) were measured at 6 hours, 12 hours, 18 hours and 24 hours. The control group measured 25 +/- 5 mmHg, 26 +/- 2 mmHg, 27 +/- 3 mmHg and 28 +/- 3 mmHg. The <el> Dobutamine <le> group measured 25 +/- 6 mmHg, 24 +/- 3 mmHg, 22 +/- 2 mmHg and 18 +/- 5 mmHg. <re> PMVP <er> decreased over time in the <el> Dobutamine <le> group (p < 0.001), while it did not change in the control group. Clinically mean time to extubation was reduced from 18 to 12 hours (p < 0.06) in the <el> Dobutamine <le> group. 
The adenovirus type 12 (Ad12) <el> E1A12S <le> oncoprotein utilizes the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signal transduction pathway to activate expression of the viral <re> E2 <er> gene, the products of which are essential for viral replication. A central unsolved question is, however, whether <el> E1A12S <le> interacts directly with PKA in the process of promoter activation. We show here that <el> E1A12S <le> binds to the regulatory subunits (R) of PKA in vitro and in vivo. Interaction depends on the N-terminus and the conserved region 1 (CR1) of <el> E1A12S <le>. Both domains are also essential for the activation of viral <re> E2 <er> gene expression. Infection of cells with Ad12 leads to the cellular redistribution of RIIalpha from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. Furthermore, RIIalpha is also located in the nucleus of cells transformed by E1 of Ad12 and transient expression of <el> E1A12S <le> leads to the redistribution of RIIalpha into the nucleus in a N-terminus- and CR1-dependent manner. Cotransfection of <el> E1A12S <le> with RIIalpha results in strong activation of the <re> E2 <er> promoter. 
Effects of fructoso-1,6-diphosphate (FDP) and cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (<el> cAMP <le>) on various steps of protein biosynthesis in isolated rat liver mitochondria were investigated. It was shown that FDP repressed and <el> cAMP <le> depressed the incorporation of both 14C-amino acid and [3H]uridine into mitochondrial polysomes. Cyclic 2',3'-adenosine monophosphate, a physiologically inactive analog of <el> cAMP <le>, had no depressing effect on the polysomes formation in mitochondria. Effects of FDP and <el> cAMP <le> on the synthesis of mitochondrial RNA at different periods of incubation (5, 10, 30 min) were studied. It was found that FDP repressed the high molecular weight mitochondrial RNA biosynthesis and prevented the mRNA formation. <el> cAMP <le> derepressed the FDP effect. Rifampicin prevented the derepressing action of <el> cAMP <le>. The rate of <re> protein synthesis <er> in the translation system isolated from mitochondria was affected neither by FDP nor by <el> cAMP <le>. 
Cisplatin is ranked as one of the most powerful and commonly prescribed anti-tumor chemotherapeutic agents which improve survival in many solid tumors including non-small cell lung cancer. However, the treatment of advanced lung cancer is restricted due to chemotherapy resistance. Here, we developed and investigated survivin promoter regulating conditionally replicating adenovirus (<re> CRAd <er>) for its anti-tumor potential alone or in combination with <el> cisplatin <le> in two lung cancer cells, H23, H2126, and their resistant cells, H23/CPR, H2126/CPR. To measure the expression of genes which regulate resistance, adenoviral transduction, metastasis, and apoptosis in cancer cells, RT-PCR and Western blotting were performed. The anti-tumor efficacy of the treatments was evaluated through flow cytometry, MTT and transwell assays. This study demonstrated that co-treatment with <el> cisplatin <le> and <re> CRAd <er> exerts synergistic anti-tumor effects on chemotherapy sensitive lung cancer cells and monotherapy of <re> CRAd <er> could be a practical approach to deal with chemotherapy resistance. Combined treatment induced stronger apoptosis by suppressing the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-2, and reversed epithelial to mesenchymal transition. 
<el> IL-15 <le> has been found to activate NF-kappaB in various types of cells. However, the role of this transcription factor in <el> IL-15 <le>- and IL-21-stimulated murine bone marrow (BM) cells is unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that both <el> IL-15 <le> and IL-21 are capable of delaying BM cell factor deprivation-induced apoptosis, but only <el> IL-15 <le> induced their proliferation. Following separation of BM cells into myeloid (CD11b(+)) and lymphoid (CD11b(-)) cell populations, we found that <el> IL-15 <le>, but not IL-21, significantly induced proliferation in both cell populations. Both cytokines significantly delayed apoptosis, but only in CD11b(-) BM cells. <el> IL-15 <le>Ralpha, CD122 (IL-2/15Rbeta), and common gamma-chains (CD132) were expressed in both populations, whereas IL-21Ralpha was expressed only in CD11b(-) BM cells. In addition, we demonstrated that <el> IL-15 <le>-induced BM <re> cell proliferation <er> was significantly inhibited in NF-kappaBp50(-/-) mice when compared with littermate controls. The ability of <el> IL-15 <le> and IL-21 to delay BM cell apoptosis was slightly inhibited in NF-kappaBp50(-/-) mice, whereas the antiapoptotic effect of LPS was markedly reversed. 
This study examined the expression patterns of <el> oxytocin <le> and steroid receptors in the bovine endometrium during the oestrous cycle and early pregnancy to elucidate their respective roles in the regulation of <re> luteolysis <er> and the maternal recognition of pregnancy. In Expt 1, uterine biopsies were collected from four cows throughout three oestrous cycles each, to provide daily samples. In Expt 2, uterine tissue was collected on days 12, 14, 16 and 18 of the oestrous cycle (n = 20) or early pregnancy (n = 16). Oxytocin receptor, oestrogen receptor alpha and progesterone receptor mRNAs were localized by in situ hybridization, and localization of oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor was confirmed by immunocytochemistry. All three receptors showed time- and cell-specific expression patterns. Oestrogen receptor alpha increased in all regions at oestrus but high concentrations were also found in the luminal epithelium during the mid-luteal phase and in the deep glands throughout the oestrous cycle. Progesterone receptor expression was higher in the stroma than it was in the types of epithelial cell, and increased expression was observed at oestrus and during the early luteal phase. The cyclical upregulation of <el> oxytocin <le> receptors in the luminal epithelium on about day 16 was not related to preceding changes in the endometrial expression of either oestradiol alpha or progesterone receptors. During early pregnancy, <el> oxytocin <le> receptor expression was suppressed. Oestrogen receptor a concentrations increased in the non-pregnant cows and decreased in the pregnant cows between days 16 and 18, but these changes followed rather than preceded the upregulation of <el> oxytocin <le> receptors in the non-pregnant cows. 
Fifteen healthy males, aged 20-30 years, participated in a double-blind cross-over study on the effect of the beta-2 stimulator <el> salbutamol <le> on <re> erythropoietin <er> concentration and hemoglobin concentration. The treatment period comprised inhalation of <el> salbutamol <le>, 0.8 mg four times daily for 2 weeks. Serum-<re> erythropoietin <er> was essentially unaltered after treatment with <el> salbutamol <le>, 9.5 +/- 4.94 IU. l-1 (mean +/- SD), as compared to both control situation, 9.2 +/- 4.50 IU. l-1(mean +/- SD), and placebo treatment (9.7 +/- 4.07 IU. l-1) (mean+/-SD). The same pattern, no significant changes between control situation and treatment with <el> salbutamol <le> or placebo, also applied to hemoglobin concentration. 
Our previous studies had revealed that the dysregulation of manganese superoxide dismutase (<el> SOD2 <le>) expression was a frequent event in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) and may be associated with enhanced metastatic potential. To further evaluate the mechanism of <el> SOD2 <le>-mediated metastasis in TSCC, TSCC cell lines with different metastatic potentials (i.e., the highly metastatic UM1 line and the UM2 line, which displays fewer metastases) were used. Compared to UM2 cells, UM1 cells exhibited significantly higher <el> SOD2 <le> activity and intracellular H(2)O(2); higher protein levels of Snail, MMP1, and pERK1/2; lower protein levels of E-cadherin; and no difference in catalase activity. Upon knockdown of <el> SOD2 <le> by RNA interference, UM1 cells displayed significantly reduced migration and <re> invasion <er> abilities; reduced activities of <el> SOD2 <le>; lower intracellular H(2)O(2); decreased protein levels of Snail, MMP1, and pERK1/2; and increased protein levels of E-cadherin. The migration and <re> invasion <er> abilities of UM2 and <el> SOD2 <le> shRNA-transfected UM1 cells were enhanced by H(2)O(2) treatment and accompanied by increased protein levels of Snail, MMP1, and pERK1/2 and decreased protein levels of E-cadherin. Moreover the migration and <re> invasion <er> abilities of UM1 cells were decreased after catalase treatment. 
Serum amyloid A (<el> SAA <le>) is expressed locally in chronic inflammatory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), where macrophages that do not accord with the classic M1/M2 paradigm also accumulate. In this study, the role of <el> SAA <le> in regulating macrophage differentiation was investigated in vitro using human blood monocytes from healthy subjects and patients with COPD and in vivo using an airway <el> SAA <le> challenge model in BALB/c mice. Differentiation of human monocytes with <el> SAA <le> stimulated the proinflammatory monokines IL-6 and IL-1β concurrently with the M2 markers CD163 and IL-10. Furthermore, <el> SAA <le>-differentiated macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) expressed markedly higher levels of IL-6 and IL-1β. The ALX/FPR2 antagonist WRW4 reduced IL-6 and IL-1β expression but did not significantly inhibit phagocytic and efferocytic activity. In vivo, <el> SAA <le> administration induced the development of a <re> CD11c <er>(high)CD11b(high) macrophage population that generated higher levels of IL-6, IL-1β, and G-CSF following ex vivo LPS challenge. Blocking CSF-1R signaling effectively reduced the number of <re> CD11c <er>(high)CD11b(high) macrophages by 71% and also markedly inhibited neutrophilic inflammation by 80%. 
HBx, a small regulatory protein of hepatitis B virus (HBV), augments viral DNA replication by stimulating <re> viral transcription <er>. Among numerous reported HBx-binding proteins, <el> DDB1 <le> has drawn attention, because <el> DDB1 <le> acts as a substrate receptor of the Cul4-<el> DDB1 <le> ubiquitin E3 ligase. Previous work reported that the <el> DDB1 <le>-HBx interaction is indispensable for HBx-stimulated viral DNA replication, suggesting that the Cul4-<el> DDB1 <le> ubiquitin E3 ligase might target cellular restriction factors for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. To gain further insight into the <el> DDB1 <le>-HBx interaction, we generated HBx mutants deficient for <el> DDB1 <le> binding (i.e., R96A, L98A, and G99A) and examined whether they support HBx-stimulated viral DNA replication. In contrast to data from previous reports, our results showed that the HBx mutants deficient for <el> DDB1 <le> binding supported viral DNA replication to nearly wild-type levels, revealing that the <el> DDB1 <le>-HBx interaction is largely dispensable for HBx-stimulated viral DNA replication. Instead, we found that <el> DDB1 <le> directly stimulates <re> viral transcription <er> regardless of HBx expression. Through an HBV infection study, importantly, we demonstrated that <el> DDB1 <le> stimulates <re> viral transcription <er> from covalently closed circular DNA, a physiological template for <re> viral transcription <er>. 
Human organic anion <re> transport <er>er 4 (hOAT4) belongs to a family of organic anion <re> transport <er>ers that play critical roles in the body disposition of clinically important drugs, including anti-viral therapeutics, anti-cancer drugs, antibiotics, antihypertensives, and anti-inflammatories. hOAT4 is abundantly expressed in the kidney and placenta. In the current study, we examined the regulation of hOAT4 by serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 2 (<el> sgk2 <le>) in the kidney COS-7 cells. We showed that <el> sgk2 <le> stimulated hOAT4 <re> transport <er> activity. Such stimulation mainly resulted from an increased cell surface expression of the <re> transport <er>er, kinetically revealed as an increased maximal <re> transport <er> velocity Vmax without significant change in substrate-binding affinity Km. We further showed that regulation of hOAT4 activity by <el> sgk2 <le> was mediated by ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2. Overexpression of Nedd4-2 enhanced hOAT4 ubiquitination, and inhibited hOAT4 <re> transport <er> activity, whereas overexpression of ubiquitin ligase-dead mutant Nedd4-2/C821A or siRNA knockdown of endogenous Nedd4-2 had opposite effects on hOAT4. Our co-immunoprecipitation experiment revealed that <el> sgk2 <le> weakened the association between hOAT4 and Nedd4-2. 
We demonstrated previously that in serum-starved MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, <el> Ang II <le> increased <re> Na+/K+ATPase <er> activity and activated the protein kinase C zeta (PKC-zeta) (Muscella et al., 2002 J Endocrinol 173:315-323; 2003 J Cell Physiol 197:61-68.). The aim of the present study was to investigate the modulation of the activity of the <re> Na+/K+ATPase <er> by PKC-zeta in MCF-7 cells. Here, using serum-starved MCF-7 cells, we have demonstrated that the effect of <el> Ang II <le> on the <re> Na+/K+ATPase <er> activity was inhibited by a synthetic myristoylated peptide with sequences based on the endogenous PKC-zeta pseudosubstrate region (zeta-PS) and by high doses of GF109203X, inhibitor of PKCs. When MCF-7 cells, grown in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), were stimulated with <el> Ang II <le> a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of the <re> Na+/K+ATPase <er> activity was obtained. Under this growth condition we found that mRNAs for AT1, AT2, and for <re> Na+/K+ATPase <er> alpha1 and alpha3 subunits were unchanged; besides both the activity of the <re> Na+/K+ATPase <er> and the level of PKC-zeta also were unaffected by the serum. The atypical PKC-iota level (present in very low abundance in serum-starved MCF-7) was increased and <el> Ang II <le> provoked its translocation from the cytosol to plasma membrane. PKC-zeta was localized to the membrane, and upon <el> Ang II <le> treatment its cellular localization did not change. The <el> Ang II <le>-mediated decrease of the <re> Na+/K+ATPase <er> activity was inhibited by high doses of GF109203X but not by zeta-PS, thus indicating that such effect was not due to PKC-zeta activity. The treatment of cells with PKC-iota antisense oligodeoxynucleotides inhibited the effects of <el> Ang II <le> on the <re> Na+/K+ATPase <er> activity. 
Leptin, an adipocyte-derived 16 kDa polypeptide hormone, has been found to regulate food intake and thermogenesis by modulating stimulatory and inhibitory pathways in the feeding circuitry of the hypothalamus, among which corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). Nitric oxide (<re> NO <er>) and prostaglandins have been shown to be involved in both CRH neurosecretion and feeding regulation. We have investigated the role of <re> NO <er>, prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin F2alpha as mediators of the hypothalamic effects of <el> leptin <le> and their possible involvement in <el> leptin <le>-stimulated CRH secretion. Using primary cultures of neonatal (5- to 6-day-old) rat hypothalamic cells, we confirmed that <el> leptin <le> (0.1-10 nM) stimulates CRH secretion. This effect was not blocked by L-N(G)-nitro-methyl-arginine (L-NAME, 100 microM), a <re> NO <er>-synthase competitive inhibitor; and <el> leptin <le> did not stimulate <re> NO <er> production. Cyclooxygenase inhibition by indomethacin (10 microM) did not modify <el> leptin <le>-induced CRH secretion, while <el> leptin <le> stimulated prostaglandin E2, and prostaglandin F2alpha secretion. 
Binding of bacterial LPS to the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) complex of inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells plays a central role in recognition of ascending bacterial infections and activation of proinflammatory responses. Since proinflammatory cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is induced in IMCD cells upon LPS exposure, the present study addressed the question of whether TLR4 mediates COX-2 induction in IMCD cells and characterized the underlying signaling mechanisms. Enhanced COX-2 expression and activity in the presence of LPS was diminished by TLR4 inhibition. LPS induced a TLR4-dependent stimulation of NF-κB and the MAPKs p38, ERK1/2, and JNK. Activation of NF-κB was under negative control of JNK, as inhibition of JNK increased NF-κB activity and COX-2 expression. Phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 required TLR4-dependent <re> release of TGF-α <er> with subsequent activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (<el> EGFR <le>), whereas JNK activation was <el> EGFR <le> independent. Inhibition of p38 or ERK1/2 had no significant effect on LPS-induced NF-κB activation, nor on activator protein 1-, cAMP response element-, or serum response element-driven reporter constructs. However, the transcriptional regulator SP-1 appears to contribute to COX-2 expression after LPS exposure. 
It has been reported that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from periodontal pathogens can penetrate gingival tissues and stimulate the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which is known as a potent stimulator of inflammation and bone resorption. Although biostimulatory effects of low-level laser irradiation such as anti-inflammatory results have been reported, the physiological mechanism is not yet clarified. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of laser irradiation on PGE2 production and cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 gene expression in LPS-challenged human gingival fibroblast (<el> hGF <le>) cells in vitro. <el> hGF <le> cells were prepared from healthy gingival tissues and challenged with LPS, and Ga-Al-As diode laser was irradiated to the <el> hGF <le> cells. The amount of PGE2 released in the culture medium was measured by radioimmunoassay, and mRNA levels were analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Irradiation with Ga-Al-As diode low-level laser significantly inhibited PGE2 production in a dose-dependent manner, which led to a reduction of <re> COX-2 mRNA level <er>s. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly malignant <re> tumor <er> with a poor prognosis and few therapeutic options. The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential of IFN regulatory factor-1 (<el> IRF-1 <le>) for cytokine gene therapy of HCC using an <el> IRF-1 <le>/human estrogen receptor fusion protein (<el> IRF-1 <le>hER), which is reversibly activatable by beta-estradiol (E2). <el> IRF-1 <le>hER stably expressing murine Hepa1-6 HCC cells (HepaIRF-1hER) were characterized by lowMHC 1, highCD54, and lack of MHC II, CD80, and CD86 expression. Activation of HepaIRF-1hER cells induced a highMHC I, lowMHC II, and highCD54 phenotype. Furthermore, they were characterized by IFN-beta secretion, decreased anchorage-independent growth in a soft agar assay, and diminished cell growth. Tumor growth in E2-treated syngeneic C57L/J mice, but not in E2-untreated mice, was suppressed. These E2-treated mice were protected against rechallenge with HepaIRF-1hER and wild-type Hepa1-6 <re> tumor <er>s even in the absence of E2, suggesting induction of <re> tumor <er> specific immunity. In fact, significant CTL activity against Hepa1-6 <re> tumor <er>s and the endogenously expressed HCC-specific self antigen alpha-fetoprotein was observed. Antitumoral effects, however, were only partially dependent on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. <el> IRF-1 <le> treatment of mice bearing HepaIRF-1hER <re> tumor <er>s resulted in growth arrest of <re> tumor <er>s, and a significant survival benefit was observed in comparison to E2-untreated mice. 
The neurotoxic effects attributed to the pesticide fenvalerate (FEN) are well-established. The aim of this study was to determine whether melatonin (<el> MLT <le>) was able to protect against FEN-induced behavior, oxidative stress, <re> apoptosis <er>, and neurogenesis using zebrafish (Danio rerio) model. Zebrafish exposed to 100 μg/L FEN for 120 h exhibited decreased swimming activity accompanied by downregulated expression of neurogenesis-related genes (Dlx2, Shha, Ngn1, Elavl3, and Gfap), suggesting that neurogenesis were impaired. In addition, FEN exposure significantly elevated oxidative stress as evidenced by increased malondialdehyde levels, as well as activities of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. Acridine orange staining demonstrated that embryos treated with FEN for 120 h significantly enhanced <re> apoptosis <er> mainly in the brain. FEN also produced upregulation of the expression of the pro-apoptotic genes (Bax, Fas, caspase 8, caspase 9, and caspase 3) and decreased expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2. <el> MLT <le> significantly attenuated the FEN-mediated oxidative stress, modulated apoptotic-regulating genes, and diminished apoptotic responses. Further, <el> MLT <le> blocked the FEN-induced effects on swimming behavior as well as on neurogenesis-related genes. 
1. The effect of local application of <el> cocaine <le> to the corpus cavernosum on intracavernous pressure (<re> ICP <er>), an experimental index for penile erection, was examined in Sprague-Dawley rats anaesthetized with chloral hydrate. The potential involvement of dopamine, noradrenaline or nitric oxide as the chemical mediator in this process, and the pharmacological action of <el> cocaine <le> as a local anaesthetic in the induced increase in <re> ICP <er>, were also investigated. 2. Intracavernous (i.c.) administration of <el> cocaine <le> (40, 80 or 160 micrograms) to the corpus cavernosum resulted in a dose-related increase in both amplitude and duration of <re> ICP <er>. 3. The elevation of <re> ICP <er> induced by <el> cocaine <le> (160 micrograms, i.c.) was not significantly influenced by prior injection into the corpus cavernosum of either the D1 or D2 dopamine receptor antagonist, R-(+)-SCH 22390 (250 pmol) or (-)-sulpiride (250 pmol). 4. Similarly, penile erection promoted by <el> cocaine <le> (160 micrograms, i.c.) was not appreciably affected by i.c. pretreatment with the alpha 1-, alpha 2-, or beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (50 pmol), yohimbine (50 pmol) or propranolol (5 nmol). 5. Whereas lignocaine (4 mumol, i.c.) depressed penile erection induced by papaverine (400 micrograms, i.c.), local application of <el> cocaine <le> (160 micrograms) into the corpus cavernosum still elicited significant elevation in <re> ICP <er> in the presence of lignocaine or papaverine. 6. The increase in <re> ICP <er> induced by <el> cocaine <le> (160 micrograms, i.c.) was attenuated dose-dependently by prior cavernosal administration of the NO synthase inhibitor, N omega-nitro-L -arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 0.5, 1 or 5 pmol) or NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, 2.5, 5 or 10 pmol). The blunting effect of L-NAME or L-NMMA was reversed by co-administration of the NO precursor, L-arginine (1 nmol, i.c.). 7. Pretreatment by local application into the corpus cavernosum of methylene blue (2.5 mumol), an inhibitor of cytosolic guanylyl cyclase, antagonized <el> cocaine <le>-induced penile erection. 8. Direct i.c. administration of a NO donor, nitroglycerin (10 or 20 nmol), mimicked the local action of <el> cocaine <le> by promoting a significant increase in <re> ICP <er>. 9. 
The role of blood <re> cholesterol <er> levels in coronary heart disease (<el> CHD <le>) and the true effect of <re> cholesterol <er>-lowering statin drugs are debatable. In particular, whether statins actually decrease cardiac mortality and increase life expectancy is controversial. Concurrently, the Mediterranean diet model has been shown to prolong life and reduce the risk of diabetes, cancer, and <el> CHD <le>. We herein review current data related to both statins and the Mediterranean diet. 
Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays a crucial role in the modulation of orofacial pain, and we hypothesized that CGRP mediated a neuron-glia crosstalk in orofacial pain. The objective of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms whereby CGRP mediated trigeminal neuron-glia crosstalk in modulating orofacial pain. Orofacial pain was elicited by ligating closed-coil springs between incisors and molars. Trigeminal neurons and satellite glial cells (SGCs) were cultured for mechanistic exploration. Gene and protein expression were determined through immunostaining, polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot. Orofacial pain was evaluated through the rat grimace scale. Our results revealed that the expressions of CGRP were elevated in both trigeminal neurons and SGCs following the induction of orofacial pain. Intraganglionic administration of CGRP and olcegepant exacerbated and alleviated orofacial pain, respectively. The knockdown of CGRP through viral vector-mediated RNA interference was able to downregulate <re> CGRP expression <er>s in both neurons and SGCs and to alleviate orofacial pain. CGRP upregulated the expression of inducible <el> nitric oxide <le> synthase through the p38 signaling pathway in cultured SGCs. In turn, L-arginine (<el> nitric oxide <le> donor) was able to enhance orofacial pain by upregulating <re> CGRP expression <er>s in vivo. In cultured trigeminal neurons, L-arginine upregulated the expression of CGRP, and this effect was diminished by cilnidipine (N-type calcium channel blocker) while not by mibefradil (L-type calcium channel blocker). 
Previous studies from this laboratory have demonstrated that a low ('physiological') dose of parathyroid hormone (PTH) effects a phosphaturia in chronically thyroparathyroidectomized (TPTX), hypocalcemic dogs, similar in magnitude to that seen in normal intact animals, without altering proximal tubular reabsorption. In addition, cyclic AMP did not increase following this amount of PTH, despite the phosphaturia. Since calcium is an important modulator of <re> transport <er> events, we studied the effects of restoring serum calcium (<el> Ca <le>) to normal before administering a physiological dose of PTH (0.3-0.5 U/kg). In hypocalcemic dogs given only physiological amounts of PTH, percentage phosphate excretion (%EPO4) rose from 3.81 +/- 1.48 to 18.29 +/- 5.69% (p less than 0.025) without any alteration in proximal tubular function. <el> Ca <le> infusion alone likewise did not change %EPO4 or proximal tubular <re> transport <er>. However, calcium-infused dogs given a physiological dose of PTH showed a reduction in proximal tubular fractional phosphate reabsorption from 0.73 +/- 0.04 to 0.63 +/- 0.04 (p less than 0.005), as well as an increase in %EPO4 (from 5.64 +/- 1.69 to 15.86 +/- 2.82%, p less than 0.001), without any increase in urinary or tissue cyclic AMP. 
The following study was performed to determine if an antibiotic impregnated in a biodegradable polymer can prevent <re> infection <er> and eradicate inoculum bacteria from contaminated polytetrafluoroethylene vascular grafts. Poly(glycolide-co-dl-lactide) amikacin microspheres (<el> PAM <le>) measuring 50-100 microns were designed to deliver 100 mg (<el> PAM <le> 100) or 300 mg (<el> PAM <le> 300) amikacin per unit dose. Twenty mongrel dogs had a short segment of infrarenal aorta replaced with a graft that had been bathed in a 2 cc solution of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (3 x 10(8) CFU/ml). Dogs were divided into three groups: Controls had contaminated grafts placed and received no therapy; <el> PAM <le> 100 and <el> PAM <le> 300 were used, respectively, to cover the grafts in the other two groups. Animals were sacrificed 14 days postoperatively at which time grafts were examined and cultured. Among controls, 7/8 had clinical graft <re> infection <er>s and all had positive cultures for S. aureus (8/8) or E. coli (5/8). None of the treated animals had clinical graft <re> infection <er>s (P < 0.001). Positive cultures were obtained for S. aureus in 2/8 (P < or = 0.007) and E. coli in 0/8 (P < or = 0.03) <el> PAM <le> 100 dogs and for S. aureus in 0/8 (P < or = 0.0002) and E. coli in 0/8 (P < or = 0.03) <el> PAM <le> 300 dogs. Two <el> PAM <le> 100 and four <el> PAM <le> 300 dogs had rare growth of contaminant bacteria (NS). 
Previously, we showed an inverse correlation between HSP27 serum levels and experimental atherogenesis in ApoE(-/-) mice that over-express HSP27 and speculated that the apparent binding of HSP27 to scavenger receptor-A (SR-A) was of mechanistic importance in attenuating foam cell formation. However, the nature and importance of the interplay between HSP27 and SR-A in atheroprotection remained unclear. Treatment of THP-1 macrophages with recombinant HSP27 (<el> rHSP27 <le>) inhibited acLDL binding (-34%; p<0.005) and uptake (-38%, p<0.05). <el> rHSP27 <le> reduced SR-A mRNA (-39%, p=0.02), total protein (-56%, p=0.01) and cell surface (-53%, p<0.001) expression. The reduction in <re> SR-A expression <er> by <el> rHSP27 <le> was associated with a 4-fold increase in nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling (p<0.001 versus control), while an inhibitor of NF-κB signaling, BAY11-7082, attenuated the negative effects of <el> rHSP27 <le> on both <re> SR-A expression <er> and lipid uptake. To determine if SR-A is required for HSP27 mediated atheroprotection in vivo, ApoE(-/-) and ApoE(-/-) SR-A(-/-) mice fed with a high fat diet were treated for 3weeks with rHSP25. Compared to controls, rHSP25 therapy reduced aortic en face and aortic sinus atherosclerotic lesion size in ApoE(-/-) mice by 39% and 36% (p<0.05), respectively, but not in ApoE(-/-)SR-A(-/-) mice. 
Immunoglobulin (Ig) E-dependent activation of mast cells is central to the allergic response. The engagement of IgE-occupied receptors initiates a series of molecular events that causes the release of preformed, and de novo synthesis of, allergic mediators. Cysteinyl leukotrienes are able to contract airway smooth muscle and increase mucus secretion and vascular permeability and recruit eosinophils. Mast cells have also recently been recognized as active participants in innate immune responses. Heat stress can modulate innate immunity by inducing stress proteins such as <re> heat <er>-<el> shock <le> proteins (HSPs). We previously demonstrated that treatment of mast cells with <re> heat <er> <el> shock <le> or acetylsalicylic acid results in an increase of TNF-alpha and IL-6 release. This effect was paralleled by expression of HSP70. In the current study, we further investigated the effects of <re> heat <er> <el> shock <le> and acetylsalicylic acid on the activation of mast cells and the release of cysteinyl leukotrienes. In mouse mast cells, derived from a culture of bone marrow cells, responsiveness to <re> heat <er> <el> shock <le>, acetylsalicylic acid and exogenous or endogenous HSP70 was monitored by measuring leukotriene C4 release. We show that after <re> heat <er> <el> shock <le> treatment and exposure to acetylsalicylic acid leukotriene production was increased. Moreover, exogenous rHSP70 also induced leukotriene production. Because it has been reported that leukotriene production in mast cells may be mediated by Toll like receptor (TLR) activation, and HSP70 also activates TLRs signaling, we further explored these issues by using mast cells that are not able to produce HSP70, i.e. <re> heat <er> <el> shock <le> factor-1 (HSF-1) knockout cells. We found that in HSF-1 knockout bone marrow derived mast cells, <re> heat <er> <el> shock <le> and acetylsalicylic acid failed to induce release of leukotrienes. Moreover, in wild type cells the surface expression of TLR4 was attenuated, whereas the intracellular expression was up-regulated. 
Cocoa powder, a rich source of polyphenols, has shown immunomodulatory properties in both the intestinal and systemic immune compartments of rats. The aim of the current study was to establish the effect of a <el> cocoa <le> diet in a rat oral <re> sensitization <er> model and also to gain insight into the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) activities induced by this diet. To achieve this, three-week-old Lewis rats were fed either a standard diet or a diet with 10% <el> cocoa <le> and were orally sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) and with cholera toxin as a mucosal adjuvant. Specific antibodies were quantified, and lymphocyte composition, gene expression, and cytokine release were established in MLN. The development of anti-OVA antibodies was almost totally prevented in <el> cocoa <le>-fed rats. In addition, this diet increased the proportion of TCRγδ+ and CD103+CD8+ cells and decreased the proportion of CD62L+CD4+ and CD62L+CD8+ cells in MLN, whereas it upregulated the gene expression of OX40L, CD11c, and IL-1β and downregulated the gene expression of IL-17α. 
We have investigated the effects of the cell-penetrating cysteine protease inhibitors <el> calpain inhibitor <le> I (N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal) and <el> calpain inhibitor <le> II (N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-methioninal) on the secretion of the beta-amyloid peptide (beta A4) using transiently transfected cells expressing beta-amyloid precursor protein (<re> APP <er>) with the NL670/671 double mutation. Calpain inhibitor I markedly reduced the amounts of immunoprecipitable beta A4 and p3 peptide released into the culture medium. Within the cells C-terminal <re> APP <er> fragments accumulated. 
Continuous oral dosing with all-trans retinoic acid (<re> RA <er>) is associated with a progressive decrease in plasma drug concentrations that has been linked to relapse and retinoid resistance in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Since oxidation by cytochrome P-450 enzymes is critical in the catabolism of this drug, we evaluated whether pretreatment with an inhibitor of this system, <el> liarozole <le>, could attenuate this phenomenon. A total of 20 patients with solid tumors completed a 4-week course of all-trans <re> RA <er> therapy. On days 1, 2, 28, and 29, serial plasma samples were obtained from these patients after ingestion of a single oral dose (45 mg/m2) of all-trans <re> RA <er>. On days 2 and 29, <el> liarozole <le> was given 1 h prior to ingestion of all-trans <re> RA <er> at single doses ranging from 75 to 300 mg. The areas under the plasma <re> RA <er> concentration x time curves (AUCs) were then compared in the presence and absence of pretreatment. Following continuous oral treatment, the mean day-28 AUC of all-trans <re> RA <er> was significantly lower than the group mean level on day 1 (504 vs 132 ng h-1 ml-1; P = 0.05). This decline in plasma concentrations on day 28 was partially reversed by <el> liarozole <le>, which increased the mean plasma all-trans <re> RA <er> AUC on day 29 to 243 ng h-1 ml-1 (P = 0.004). The lowest dose of <el> liarozole <le> that reliably produced this effect was 300 mg. No enhanced toxicity was associated with <el> liarozole <le> administration. 
Media from large vessel endothelial cells (pulmonary artery, aorta) contained intact connective tissue growth factor (<re> CTGF <er>) and a dominant 19-kDa band. N-terminal analysis of the 19-kDa band showed sequence corresponding to <re> CTGF <er> amino acid 181-190, suggesting that the 19-kDa band represented a proteolytic fragment of <re> CTGF <er>. Intact <re> CTGF <er> was increased by cAMP but not by transforming growth factor-beta (<el> TGFbeta <le>). <re> CTGF <er> messenger RNA (mRNA) was not changed by cAMP nor <el> TGFbeta <le>. In two microvessel endothelial cells, mRNA was found at low levels by PCR and Northern analysis, but no <re> CTGF <er> protein was seen on Western analysis. In the microvessel cells, <el> TGFbeta <le> increased and cAMP did not change <re> CTGF <er> mRNA levels, with neither <el> TGFbeta <le> nor cAMP increasing <re> CTGF <er> protein. The discordance between protein and mRNA levels in large vessel and microvessel endothelial cells was mostly explained by the effects of cAMP and <el> TGFbeta <le> on media proteolytic activity; in large vessel cells, cAMP inhibited degradation of <re> CTGF <er>, whereas in microvessel cells, <el> TGFbeta <le> and cAMP stimulated proteolytic activity against <re> CTGF <er>. 
Prognosis and survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still very poor, and no therapies are currently available to inhibit tumour growth and metastases. Recently, we reported that the expression of an extracellular matrix component (ECM), namely Laminin-5 (<el> Ln-5 <le>), is directly related to poor prognosis in HCC patients. The aim of our study is to investigate the preclinical effect of gefitinib in an in vitro HCC model. We found that the IC(50) of gefitinib in HCC cells ranged from 0.7 to 10.0 muM, whereas <el> Ln-5 <le> inhibited the activity of gefitinib in a dose-dependent manner. Complete inhibition of phosphorylated (p)-EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) was obtained within 6 h exposure to gefitinib and complete restoration of the receptor status was obtained after 24 h. A downstream effect yields a decrease in p-<re> Akt <er> and p-Erk 1/2. The addition of exogenous <el> Ln-5 <le> has no effect on p-EGFR, whereas it restores p-Erk 1/2 and p-<re> Akt <er>. Consistently, <el> Ln-5 <le> induces recovery of HCC cells from Gefitinib-induced apoptosis. 
The contribution of <el> ABCA1 <le>-mediated efflux of cellular phospholipid (PL) and <re> cholesterol <er> to human apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) to the formation of pre beta 1-HDL (or lipid-poor apoA-I) is not well defined. To explore this issue, we characterized the nascent HDL particles formed when lipid-free apoA-I was incubated with fibroblasts in which expression of the <el> ABCA1 <le> was upregulated. After a 2 h incubation, the extracellular medium contained small apoA-I/PL particles (pre beta 1-HDL; diameter = 7.5 +/- 0.4 nm). The pre beta 1-HDL (or lipid-poor apoA-I) particles contained a single apoA-I molecule and three to four PL molecules and one to two <re> cholesterol <er> molecules. An apoA-I variant lacking the C-terminal alpha-helix did not form such particles when incubated with the cell, indicating that this helix is critical for the formation of lipid-poor apoA-I particles. These pre beta 1-HDL particles were as effective as lipid-free apoA-I molecules in mediating both the efflux of cellular lipids via <el> ABCA1 <le> and the formation of larger, discoidal HDL particles. 
The mycotoxin ochratoxin A (<el> OTA <le>) is a naturally occuring contaminant of food. The genotoxic status of <el> OTA <le> is still controversial because contradictory results were obtained in various microbial and mammalian gene mutation assays. In this study, <el> OTA <le> was investigated to examine its potency to induce micronuclei (MN) in SHE cells. The SHE-micronucleus assay revealed that <el> OTA <le> induces MN in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The results of kinetochore analysis revealed that mainly clastogenic events are involved in <el> OTA <le> genotoxicity. Induction of mitotic disturbances can be closely related to changes of the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). The investigated time course of <el> OTA <le>-induced [Ca2+]i changes revealed that the obtained signal is a short spike signal resembling physiological responses. In the absence of extracellular calcium, a long-lasting signal indicates possible damage to intracellular calcium stores or channels. Our data show that the <el> OTA <le>-induced [Ca2+]i rise is caused by Ca2+ -release from intracellular stores as well as Ca2+ influx from extracellular area. Finally, the influence of the changed intracellular calcium level on the <re> actin <er> cytoskeleton was investigated. Visualization of the <re> actin <er> filaments revealed time- and concentration-dependent effects. Cell shrinkage and depolymerized filaments were observed. 
We examined effects of <el> hyperthermia <le> on cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) and cerebral blood flow (<re> CBF <er>) in anesthetized, newborn pigs (2-5 days old). <re> CBF <er> and CMRO2 were measured during normothermia (38 degrees C) and during <el> hyperthermia <le> induced by body heating (42 degrees C). During normothermia, total <re> CBF <er> was 32 +/- 3 ml.min-1.100 g-1 (n = 9), and CMRO2 was 1.34 +/- 0.08 ml O2.100 g-1.min-1 (n = 7). During <el> hyperthermia <le>, total <re> CBF <er> increased by 97 +/- 23% and CMRO2 by 65 +/- 24%. We also examined whether cerebral resistance vessels were responsive under these conditions. During <el> hyperthermia <le>, total <re> CBF <er> was 63 +/- 6 ml.min-1.100 g-1, and CMRO2 was 2.13 +/- 0.27 ml O2.100 g-1.min-1. During sustained <el> hyperthermia <le>, intravenous injection of 5 mg/kg of indomethacin decreased total <re> CBF <er> by 45 +/- 7% (n = 9), and CMRO2 fell by 55 +/- 10% (n = 5). 
Modifying the visual aspect of a virtual arm that is felt as one's own using immersive virtual reality (<el> VR <le>) modifies <re> pain <er> threshold in healthy subjects, but does it modify <re> pain <er> ratings in chronic <re> pain <er> patients? Our aim was to investigate whether varying properties of a virtual arm co-located with the real arm modulated <re> pain <er> ratings in patients with chronic arm/hand <re> pain <er> because of complex regional <re> pain <er> syndrome (CRPS) type I (without nerve injury) or peripheral nerve injury (PNI). CRPS (n = 9) and PNI (n = 10) patients were immersed in <el> VR <le> and the virtual arm was shown at 4 transparency levels (transparency test) and 3 sizes (size test). We evaluated <re> pain <er> ratings throughout the conditions and assessed the virtual experience, finding that patients with chronic <re> pain <er> can achieve levels of ownership and agency over a virtual arm similar to healthy participants. All 7 conditions globally decreased <re> pain <er> ratings by half. Increasing transparency decreased <re> pain <er> in CRPS but did the opposite in PNI, whereas increasing size slightly increased <re> pain <er> ratings only in CRPS. 
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to play critical roles in many cellular processes including those regulating skeletal development and homeostasis. A previous study from our group identified differentially expressed miRNAs in the developing human growth plate. Among those more highly expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes compared to progenitor chondrocytes was miR-138, therefore suggesting a possible role for this miRNA in regulating chondrogenesis and/or endochondral ossification. The goal of this study was to determine the function of miR- 138 in regulating osteogenesis by using human osteoarthritic dedifferentiated chondrocytes (DDCs) as source of inducible cells. We show that over-expression of miR-138 inhibited osteogenic <re> differentiation <er> of DDCs in vitro. Moreover, cell shape was altered and cell proliferation and possibly migration was also suppressed by miR-138. Given alterations in cell shape, closer analysis revealed that F-actin polymerization was also inhibited by miR-138. Computational approaches showed that the small GTPase, <el> RhoC <le>, is a potential miR-138 target gene. We pursued <el> RhoC <le> further given its function in regulating cell proliferation and migration in cancer cells. Indeed, miR-138 over-expression in DDCs resulted in decreased <el> RhoC <le> protein levels. A series of rescue experiments showed that <el> RhoC <le> over-expression could attenuate the inhibitory actions of miR-138 on DDC proliferation, F-actin polymerization and osteogenic <re> differentiation <er>. Bone formation was also found to be enhanced within human demineralized bone scaffolds seeded with DDCs expressing both miR-138 and <el> RhoC <le>. 
Luminal nucleotide stimulation is known to reduce Na(+) transport in the distal nephron. Previous studies suggest that this mechanism may involve the thiazide-sensitive Na(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter (NCC), which plays an essential role in NaCl reabsorption in the cells lining the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Here we show that stimulation of mouse DCT (mDCT) cells with ATP or UTP promoted <el> Ca <le>(2+) transients and decreased the <re> expression of NCC <er> at both mRNA and protein levels. Specific siRNA-mediated silencing of P2Y2 receptors almost completely abolished ATP/UTP-induced <el> Ca <le>(2+) transients and significantly reduced ATP/UTP-induced decrease of NCC expression. To test whether local variations in the intracellular <el> Ca <le>(2+) concentration ([<el> Ca <le>(2+)]i) may control NCC transcription, we overexpressed the <el> Ca <le>(2+)-binding protein parvalbumin selectively in the cytosol or in the nucleus of mDCT cells. The decrease in NCC mRNA upon nucleotide stimulation was abolished in cells overexpressing cytosolic PV but not in cells overexpressing either a nuclear-targeted PV or a mutated PV unable to bind <el> Ca <le>(2+). Using a firefly luciferase reporter gene strategy, we observed that the activity of NCC promoter region from -1 to -2,200 bp was not regulated by changes in [<el> Ca <le>(2+)]i. In contrast, high cytosolic calcium level induced instability of NCC mRNA. 
Complement activation and subsequent recruitment of inflammatory cells at the dermal/epidermal junction are thought to be essential for blister formation in bullous pemphigoid (<el> BP <le>), an autoimmune blistering disease induced by autoantibodies against type XVII collagen (<re> COL17 <er>); however, this theory does not fully explain the pathological features of <el> BP <le>. Recently, the involvement of complement-independent pathways has been proposed. To directly address the question of the necessity of the complement activation in blister formation, we generated C3-deficient <re> COL17 <er>-humanized mice. First, we show that passive transfer of autoantibodies from <el> BP <le> patients induced blister formation in neonatal C3-deficient <re> COL17 <er>-humanized mice without complement activation. By using newly generated human and murine mAbs against the pathogenic noncollagenous 16A domain of <re> COL17 <er> with high (human IgG1, murine IgG2), low (murine IgG1), or no (human IgG4) complement activation abilities, we demonstrate that the deposition of Abs, and not complements, is relevant to the induction of blister formation in neonatal and adult mice. Notably, passive transfer of <el> BP <le> autoantibodies reduced the amount of <re> COL17 <er> in lesional mice skin, as observed in cultured normal human keratinocytes treated with the same Abs. Moreover, the <re> COL17 <er> depletion was associated with a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. 
Hepatocyte growth factor (<el> HGF <le>) is a potent mitogen for mature hepatocytes. Because <el> HGF <le> has strong effects on the motility of keratinocytes and is produced by fibroblasts, <el> HGF <le> is thought to regulate <re> keratinocyte migration <er> during wound healing. However, the intracellular signaling mechanism of <el> HGF <le>-induced <re> keratinocyte migration <er> is poorly understood. In this report, we clarify the roles of STAT3 and SOCS/CIS family in <el> HGF <le>-induced <re> keratinocyte migration <er>. <el> HGF <le> activated STAT3 and strongly induced <re> keratinocyte migration <er>. Transfection with the dominant-negative mutant of STAT3 almost completely abolished <el> HGF <le>-induced <re> keratinocyte migration <er> and STAT3 phosphorylation. Next, we studied the mechanisms that regulate STAT3 phosphorylation. <el> HGF <le> enhanced the expression of SOCS3/CIS3 by sixfold within 1h, but had minimum effect on SOCS1/JAB expression. Transfection with SOCS3/CIS3 almost completely abolished <el> HGF <le>-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and <re> keratinocyte migration <er>, indicating that SOCS3/CIS3 acts as a negative regulator of <el> HGF <le>-induced <re> keratinocyte migration <er>. 
Recent studies have shown abnormal expression levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (<el> COX-2 <le>) and miR-21b-3p in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) rat models. Decreased <el> COX-2 <le> expression could reduce brain injury and thus could be a target of miR-21b-3p according to the miRNA databases (miRDB) analysis. However, its functions and underlying mechanisms in I/R injury remain unclear. In our study, we have established an oxygen/glucose deprivation and reperfusion (<re> OGD/R <er>) model by using NS2OY cells. The expression of miR-21b-3p and <el> COX-2 <le> was determined by quantitative real-time PCR or Western blot, and the fluorescence intensities were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or immunofluorescence. After transfection and <re> OGD/R <er> treatments, the functions of miR-21b-3p and <el> COX-2 <le> on cell viability and apoptosis were detected using cell-counting kit 8, Edu staining, flow cytometry and Hoechst staining, respectively. Finally, dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to explore the relationship between miR-21-b-3p and <el> COX-2 <le>. The results have showed that <el> COX-2 <le> mRNA and protein expression were significantly increased; however, the expression of miR-21b-3p was remarkably reduced in NS2OY cells after <re> OGD/R <er> treatment. The changes were most remarkable in OGD 2 h/R24 group. Function analysis has showed that when NS2OY cells were exposed to <re> OGD/R <er> injury, overexpressed miR-21b-3p significantly downregulated <el> COX-2 <le> expression, increased cell viability and decreased apoptosis. In addition, knocking down the expression of <el> COX-2 <le> could also increase cell viability and decrease apoptosis. Dual-luciferase reporter assays showed miR-21b-3p as the target of 3'-UTR of <el> COX-2 <le>. 
Overdose of acetaminophen (APAP) induces acute liver injury due in part to destruction of mitochondria and resulted oxidative stress. Recently, <el> FGF21 <le> has been demonstrated to be an endocrine factor to protect liver from oxidative stress. The aim of present study is to explore the role of fibroblast growth factor 21 (<el> FGF21 <le>) in the protective effect of fenofibrate, an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), against acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury. Mice and primary cultured hepatocytes were used to test the potential hepatoprotective effect of fenofibrate against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. <el> FGF21 <le> deficient mice were used to evaluate the role of <el> FGF21 <le> in fenofibrate against APAP-induced acute liver injury. Post-treatment with fenofibrate significantly inhibits APAP-induced hepatotoxicity, as evidenced by decreased serum ALT and AST levels and hepatic necrosis in liver tissue as well as increased the surviving rate in response to APAP overdose, whereas this protective effect of fenofibrate is largely attenuated in <el> FGF21 <le> KO mice. Interestingly, administration of fenofibrate efficiently increases <re> autophagy <er>, which was companied with alleviating hepatotoxicity in APAP-treated WT mice. However, such effect is significantly attenuated in APAP-treated <el> FGF21 <le> KO mice. 
The secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and the <re> GnRH <er> receptor (<re> GnRH <er>-R) concentration are modulated by ovarian steroids and <re> GnRH <er>. To elucidate whether this regulation is due to alterations at the transcriptional level, we examined the <re> GnRH <er> I-R mRNA expression in the gonadotroph-derived cell line alphaT3-1 treated with different estradiol and <el> progesterone <le> paradigms and the <re> GnRH <er> I agonist triptorelin. alphaT3-1 cells were treated with different steroid paradigms: 1 nM estradiol or 100 nM <el> progesterone <le> for 48 h alone or in combination. Cells were exposed to 10 nM or 100 pM triptorelin for 30 min, 3 h, 9 h, or, in pulsatile way, with a 5-min pulse per hour. The <re> GnRH <er> I-R mRNA was determined by Northern blot analysis. <re> GnRH <er> I-R mRNA from cells treated with continuous triptorelin decreased in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Pulsatile triptorelin increased <re> GnRH <er> I-R gene expression. Progesterone alone further enhanced this effect, whereas estradiol and its combination with <el> progesterone <le> diminished it. Continuous combined treatment with estradiol and <el> progesterone <le> lead to a significant decrease of <re> GnRH <er> I-R mRNA by 30% and by 35% for estradiol alone. The addition of 10 nM triptorelin for 30 min or 3 h could not influence that steroid effect. 
Air pollution caused by fuel burning contributes to respiratory impairments that may lead to death. We aimed to investigate the effects of biodiesel (DB) burning in mouse lungs. DB particulate matter was collected from the exhaust pipes of a bus engine. Mice were treated with 250 μg or 1000 μg of DB particulate matter by intranasal instillation over 5 consecutive days. We demonstrated that DB particulate matter penetrated the lung in the 250-μg and 1000-μg groups. In addition, the DB particulate matter number in pulmonary parenchyma was 175-fold higher in the 250-μg group and 300-fold higher in the 1000-μg group compared to control mice. The instillation of DB particulate matter increased the macrophage number and protein levels of TNF-alpha in murine lungs. DB particulate matter enhanced ROS production in both exposed groups and the malondialdehyde levels compared to the control group. The protein expression levels of Nrf2, <el> p-NF-kB <le>, and <re> HO-1 <er> were higher in the 250-μg group and lower in the 1000-μg group than in control mice and the 250-μg group. 
Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a neuropeptide that occurs in several tissues, e.g., in the gut. We have studied PACAP-like immunoreactivity in the pancreas of rat and mouse, and the effects of <el> PACAP-38 <le> on basal and stimulated insulin and <re> glucagon secretion <er> in the mouse. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated the presence of PACAP-like immunoreactivity in nerve fibers in both the rat and mouse pancreas. The nerve fibers were seen in the exocrine pancreas and surrounding the islets. Occasionally, the nerve fibers occurred within the islets. Most PACAP-positive nerve fibers innervated the intrapancreatic ganglia, although no nerve cell bodies contained PACAP-like immunoreactivity. In-vivo experiments in mice revealed that basal plasma glucagon levels were increased by <el> PACAP-38 <le> injected intravenously at dose levels exceeding 1.8 nmol/kg. Furthermore, <el> PACAP-38 <le> (7 nmol/kg) potentiated the plasma glucagon response to the cholinergic agonist carbachol (0.16 mumol/kg). This potentiation was reduced to simple addition by pretreatment with a combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade by phentolamine (35 mumol/kg) and propranolol (8.5 mumol/kg). Moreover, <el> PACAP-38 <le> inhibited a carbachol-induced increase in the level of plasma insulin in the absence but not in the presence of adrenergic blockade. <el> PACAP-38 <le> increased basal plasma insulin levels and increased basal plasma glucose levels 6 min and 10 min, respectively, after injection of the peptide. 
In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of <el> PDE <le> V inhibition on <re> NO <er>-mediated relaxation responses in isolated guinea pig trachea. Under the NANC conditions, tracheal preparations were contracted with histamine (100 microm/l). When contraction had reached a plateau, relaxation responses to electrical field stimulation (EFS, 60 V, 0.5 ms, 5-10 Hz) were determined before and after incubation of the tracheal ring with L-NAME (1 mmol/l), a <re> NO <er> synthase inhibitor. L-NAME significantly inhibited the relaxation responses and this inhibitory effect was reversed by L-arginine (1 mmol/l), a precursor of <re> NO <er>, but was not affected by D-arginine. In addition, cumulative application of the <re> NO <er> donors, 3-morpholino-sydnonimine (SIN-1) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), caused concentration-dependent relaxation of tissues precontracted with histamine. The selective <el> PDE <le> type V inhibitor zaprinast at EC50 concentration (30 micromol/l) significantly potentiated EFS-induced NANC relaxations and relaxant responses to SIN-1 and SNP. 
The effect of activated <el> charcoal <le> on <re> fluoxetine <er> (40 mg) absorption, with special reference to delayed <el> charcoal <le> administration, was investigated in a randomized study with four parallel groups of eight Healthy volunteers. The first group ingested <re> fluoxetine <er> on an empty stomach with water only (control). The second group received 25 g of activated <el> charcoal <le> as a suspension immediately after <re> fluoxetine <er>. The third and fourth groups took <re> fluoxetine <er> with water and received 25 g of <el> charcoal <le> 2 or 4 hr after <re> fluoxetine <er>. Timed blood samples were taken and plasma <re> fluoxetine <er> and norfluoxetine concentrations were measured by GC for 96 hr. When <el> charcoal <le> was administered immediately after <re> fluoxetine <er>, the AUC (0-96 hr) of <re> fluoxetine <er> was reduced by more than 96% (P < 0.0005) and the Cmax by more than 98% (P < 0.0005). The reduction in the AUC (0-96 hr) and Cmax of norfluoxetine was similar to that of <re> fluoxetine <er>. When the administration of <el> charcoal <le> was delayed 2 or 4 hr, there was a non-significant mean reduction of 16% and 23% in the AUC (0-96 hr) of <re> fluoxetine <er>. Similarly, the Cmax was not significantly reduced by <el> charcoal <le> given 2 or 4 hr later. Also, the half-life of <re> fluoxetine <er> was not significantly reduced (by 25%) by the late administration of <el> charcoal <le>. 
Endothelial cell death is linked to vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and tissue ischemia. miRNA-17-92 (miR-17-92) is a multiple functional oncogenic miRNA cluster which plays vital roles in tumor angiogenesis and tissue development. However, its role in regulation of endothelial cell <re> ferroptosis <er> remains unclear. In this study, we revealed that miR-17-92 protects endothelial HUVEC cells from <el> erastin <le>-induced <re> ferroptosis <er>. miR-17-92 overexpression significantly reduced <el> erastin <le>-induced growth inhibition and ROS generation of HUVEC cells. Furthermore, Zinc lipoprotein A20, a validated target of miR-17-92, was identified as a novel regulator of endothelial cell <re> ferroptosis <er>. Lentivirus mediated A20 overexpression increased ROS generation and enhanced <el> erastin <le>-induced <re> ferroptosis <er>, whereas A20 knockdown inhibited <el> erastin <le>-induced <re> ferroptosis <er>. Mechanistic studies revealed that <el> erastin <le>-induced <re> ferroptosis <er> is associated with GPX4 downregulation and ACSL4 upregulation. miR-17-92 overexpression or A20 inhibition increased the ACSL4 expression in HUVEC cells. A20 was identified to directly with and regulate ACSL4 expression by immunoprecipitation. It suggests that the A20-ACSL4 axis plays important roles in <el> erastin <le>-induced endothelial <re> ferroptosis <er>. 
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern-recognition receptors that have a pivotal role as primary sensors of microbial products and as initiators of innate and adaptive immune responses. We investigated the role of TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4 activation during cutaneous allergen sensitization in the modulation of allergic asthma. The results show that dermal exposure to TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or TLR2 ligand Pam3Cys suppresses asthmatic responses by reducing airway hyperreactivity, mucus production, <el> Th2 <le>-type inflammation in the lungs, and IgE antibodies in serum in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, TLR3 ligand Poly(I:C) did not protect the mice from asthmatic symptoms but reduced IgE and induced IgG2a in serum. LPS (especially) and Pam3Cys enhanced the activation of dermal dendritic cell (DCs) by increasing the expression of CD80 and CD86 but decreased DC numbers in draining lymph nodes at early time points. Later, these changes in DCs led to an increased number of CD8(+) T cells and enhanced the production of <re> IFN-γ <er> in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. 
Bacterial and viral diseases are major problems in Atlantic salmon aquaculture, but may be challenged through selection of brood stock with enhanced survival to diseases. Today's selection strategy is based on controlled challenge tests using siblings of the breeding candidates, and is thus indirect. Direct trait records on breeding candidates can potentially be provided through identification of genetic variation linked to the susceptibility to the disease. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) is a lipid-sensing transcription factor primarily known for inducing fat-accumulation in adipocytes, but also in lipid-accumulating macrophages, in mammalian species. Here we report a novel allele of PPARG, <el> pparg-2 <le>, in Atlantic salmon. <el> pparg-2 <le> has an insertion of sixty nucleotides that encodes two additional copies of the almost perfect decapeptide motif, (F/C/Y)NHSPDR(S/N)HS, compared to the previously described pparg-1. pparg-1 contains six copies of this repeat unit whereas eight copies are present in the novel <el> pparg-2 <le> allele. <el> pparg-2 <le> mRNA was detectable in kidney and spleen of random Atlantic salmon samples. Here, we studied the effect of pparg-1 and <el> pparg-2 <le> on survival upon challenge to a highly virulent bacterium, Aeromonas salmonicida, causing <re> furunculosis <er>, and the virus causing infectious salmon anaemia (ISA), respectively, in a Norwegian aquaculture population of Atlantic salmon. ppar alleles were found to be significantly associated with survival upon challenge to A. salmonicida, but not to ISA. <el> pparg-2 <le> was the better allele in terms of survival in the challenge test for <re> furunculosis <er>, survival rates being 0.32, 0.40 and 0.42 for animals with the pparg-1,-1, pparg-1, -2 and <el> pparg-2 <le>, -2 genotypes, respectively. 
Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) and nuclear receptor related-1 (Nurr1) play pivotal roles in the development and survival of dopaminergic neurons, and deficiencies in these genes may be involved in Parkinson's disease (<re> PD <er>) pathogenesis. Recently, anthelminthic benzimidazoles were shown to promote HIF-1α transcription in vitro and were proposed to activate Nurr1 via their benzimidazole group. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the neuroprotective effects of albendazole (ABZ), an anthelminthic benzimidazole, in a <el> rotenone <le> model of Parkinson's disease (<re> PD <er>). Rotenone (1.5 mg/kg) was subcutaneously injected into rats every other day for a period of 21 days, resulting in the development of the essential features of <re> PD <er>. In addition to <el> rotenone <le>, ABZ (10 mg/kg) was administered orally starting from the 11th day. Treatment of rats with ABZ markedly mitigated <el> rotenone <le>-induced histological alterations in substantia nigra (SN), restored striatal dopamine (DA) level and motor functions and decreased the expression of α-synuclein (a disease marker protein). ABZ also enhanced expression of Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) in the SN along with its downstream target, vascular endothelial growth factor, promoting neuronal survival. Similarly, ABZ augmented nuclear receptor related-1 (Nurr1) expression in the SN and increased transcriptional activation of Nurr1-controlled genes, which are essential for regulation of DA synthesis; additionally, expression of neurotoxic proinflammatory cytokines that induce neuronal death was suppressed. 
The antiarrhythmic actions of the racemate and enantiomers of <el> mexiletine <le> were studied in conscious and anaesthetised rats. Racemate or enantiomers, at 20 mg/kg i.v., had little effect on ischaemia-induced <re> ventricular fibrillation <er> in conscious or anaesthetised rats. In conscious rats 20 mg/kg caused convulsions in 78-89% of rats when the plasma concentration of racemate was 20 +/- 2 microM. In anaesthetized animals a higher dose (40 mg/kg) of racemate could be given; this completely prevented ischaemia-induced fibrillation when the plasma concentration was 26 +/- 2 microM. Racemate and enantiomers accumulated in the heart and brain of conscious animals to give tissue: plasma ratios of 7.5 and 23, respectively. With electrical stimulation, both racemate and enantiomers dose dependently (4-32 mg/kg) increased threshold currents for induction of <re> ventricular fibrillation <er>, increased refractory period and minimally changed the ECG; findings expected with a Class Ib antiarrhythmic. The above studies failed to show major differences between racemate or enantiomers except for consistently lower (20-30%) plasma concentrations of R(-) at all dose levels. 
Inhibitors of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 prevent suppression of aquaporin-2 and reduce polyuria in the acute phase after release of bilateral ureteral obstruction (BUO). We hypothesized that BUO leads to <el> COX-2 <le>-mediated local accumulation of prostanoids in inner medulla (<re> IM <er>) tissue. To test this, rats were subjected to BUO and treated with selective COX-1 or <el> COX-2 <le> inhibitors. Tissue was examined at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after BUO. <el> COX-2 <le> protein abundance increased in <re> IM <er> 12 and 24 h after onset of BUO but did not change in cortex. COX-1 did not change at any time points in any region. A full profile of all five primary prostanoids was obtained by mass spectrometric determination of PGE(2), PGF(2alpha), 6-keto-PGF(1alpha), PGD(2), and thromboxane (Tx) B(2) concentrations in kidney cortex/outer medulla and <re> IM <er> fractions. <re> IM <er> concentration of PGE(2), 6-keto-PGF(1alpha), and PGF(2alpha) was increased at 6 h BUO, and PGE(2) and PGF(2alpha) increased further at 12 h BUO. TxB(2) increased after 12 h BUO. 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) remained significantly increased after 24 h BUO. The <el> COX-2 <le> inhibitor parecoxib lowered <re> IM <er> PGE(2,) TxB(2), 6-keto-PGF(1alpha), and PGF(2alpha) below vehicle-treated BUO and sham rats at 6, 12 and, 24 h BUO. The COX-1 inhibitor SC-560 lowered PGE(2), PGF(2alpha), and PGD(2) in <re> IM <er> compared with untreated 12 h BUO, but levels remained significantly above sham. In cortex tissue, PGE(2) and 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) concentrations were elevated at 6 h only. 
The two glucose transporter isoforms GLUT4 and GLUT1 present in 3T3-L1 cells were labeled in the <el> insulin <le>-stimulated and basal states with the impermeant bis-mannose photolabel, 2-N-4-(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzoyl-1,3-bis-(D-mannos- 4-yloxy)-2-propylamine. The redistributions of these labeled transporters from the plasma membrane to the low density microsome membrane fraction were followed while cells were maintained at either <el> insulin <le>-stimulated or basal steady states. In both these steady states GLUT4 and GLUT1 were continuously recycled. Analysis of the time courses for tracer-tagged GLUT4 and GLUT1 redistribution showed that the endocytosis rate constants were only approximately 30% slower in the <el> insulin <le>-stimulated (0.08 and 0.093 min-1) compared with the basal (0.116 and 0.121 min-1) state. In the <el> insulin <le>-stimulated state, the rate constants for GLUT4 and GLUT1 <re> exocytosis <er> (0.086 and 0.096 min-1) were similar to those of endocytosis. In contrast, the <re> exocytosis <er> rate constants of GLUT4 and GLUT1 in the basal state were 0.01 and 0.035 min-1. 
Endothelin-1 (ET-1) induces pulmonary <el> vascular remodeling <le> and pulmonary hypertension secondary to <re> pulmonary fibrosis <er>. Given that endothelial cells are the main source of ET-1 and ET-1 from other cells may encounter difficulty penetrating vascular compartments, we hypothesize that endothelial-derived ET-1 promotes <el> vascular remodeling <le> secondary to <re> pulmonary fibrosis <er>. We used vascular endothelial ET-1 knock-out (VEETKO) and Wild type mice for this research. They were given intratracheal bleomycin and euthanized at day 28. We quantified <re> pulmonary fibrosis <er>, measured lung ET-1 and its receptors' expression, and assessed pulmonary <el> vascular remodeling <le> by calculating medial wall index, muscularization index, adventitial collagen and adventitial fibroblast and macrophage accumulation. Right ventricle remodeling was also assessed. Both VEETKO and Wild type mice developed comparable <re> pulmonary fibrosis <er> and similar fibrosis-related gene expression. Compared to Wild type mice, bleomycin-induced VEETKO mice had lower ET-1 peptide levels (15.4 pg/mg vs. 31.2 pg/mg, p<0.01). Expression of both ET-1 receptors mRNAs were increased in fibrosis models. Bleomycin-induced fibrosis VEETKO mice had significantly less muscularized arterioles, lower muscularization index and attenuated adventitial collagen, fibroblast and macrophage accumulation as compared to that of Wild type mice. Right ventricular pressure, hypertrophy and fibrosis did not increase both in VEETKO and Wild type mice despite the more enhanced <el> vascular remodeling <le> in Wild type. 
Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation has recently been shown to inhibit apoptosis in breast epithelial cells. We have previously described a group of genes that is rapidly up-regulated in these cells following dexamethasone (Dex) treatment. In an effort to dissect the mechanisms of GR-mediated breast epithelial <re> cell survival <er>, we now examine the molecular events downstream of GR activation. Here we show that GR activation leads to both the rapid induction of <el> MAPK <le> phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) mRNA and its sustained expression. Induction of the MKP-1 protein in the MCF10A-Myc and MDA-MB-231 breast epithelial cell lines was also seen. Paclitaxel treatment resulted in <el> MAPK <le> activation and apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, and both processes were inhibited by Dex pretreatment. Furthermore, induction of MKP-1 correlated with the inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity, whereas p38 activity was minimally affected. Blocking Dex-induced MKP-1 induction using small interfering RNA increased ERK1/2 and JNK phosphorylation and decreased <re> cell survival <er>. ERK1/2 and JNK inactivation was associated with Ets-like transcription factor-1 (ELK-1) dephosphorylation. To explore the gene expression changes that occur downstream of ELK-1 dephosphorylation, we used a combination of temporal gene expression data and promoter element analyses. This approach revealed a previously unrecognized transcriptional target of ELK-1, the human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). We verified the predicted ELK-1--> tPA transcriptional regulatory relationship using a luciferase reporter assay. 
Inflammation is regarded as one of the major hallmarks of tumors, and has a very close relationship with gastric cancer. Interleukin-33 (<el> IL-33 <le>), a new member of the IL-1 family, plays an important role in both inflammatory disease and tumors. The present study was designed to explore the effects of <el> IL-33 <le> on the proliferation, drug sensitivity, and the invasiveness of gastric cancer cells in vitro. <el> IL-33 <le> at concentrations lower than 100 pg/ml did not alter the inhibitory rate of gastric cancer cells. Moreover, <el> IL-33 <le> at these low concentrations protected against platinum-induced apoptosis in various gastric cancer cell lines, yet not in normal gastric epithelial cells. We also found that <el> IL-33 <le> increased the activation of the JNK pathway, and enhanced the expression of ST2. Furthermore, SP600125, a selective inhibitor of the JNK pathway, significantly blocked the protective effects of <el> IL-33 <le> in gastric cancer cells. In addition, Matrigel <re> invasion <er> assay showed that <el> IL-33 <le> markedly promoted gastric cancer cell <re> invasion <er>. 
It has previously been demonstrated that <el> glucocorticoid <le> suppression of mitogen-induced <re> lymphocyte activation <er> is a function of mitogen dose. Glucocorticoids suppress <re> lymphocyte activation <er> more at low doses, which induce suboptimal <re> lymphocyte activation <er>, than at higher doses which are optimal for <re> lymphocyte activation <er>. This observation suggests that <el> glucocorticoid <le> suppression of <re> lymphocyte activation <er> might be greater than normal in disease states which are associated with depressed mitogen-induced <re> lymphocyte activation <er>. To test this hypothesis, lymphocytes from normal individuals and patients with cystic fibrosis were activated by a full range of concentrations of concanavalin A (Con A) in the presence or absence of dexamethasone. Con A activation of cystic fibrosis lymphocytes was markedly depressed compared to the activation of normal lymphocytes at all doses of Con A, but the suppressive effect of dexamethasone on the activation of normal and cystic fibrosis lymphocytes was the same. 
<el> MTX <le> is an effective therapy for autoimmune-inflammatory diseases. The mechanisms that mediate these actions are not completely clear. It is accepted that many of these effects are mediated through the release of adenosine with the activation of the adenosine receptor A2. <el> MTX <le> is used as a steroid sparing agent. An improved in vitro GC cell sensitivity in GC insensitive asthma patients has been demonstrated after <el> MTX <le> treatment. Most GC actions are mediated by the <re> GCR <er>. The effect of <el> MTX <le> on <re> GCR <er>s expression has not been previously evaluated. Therefore, we evaluate if <el> MTX <le> regulates the expression of glucocorticoid receptors, increasing the expression of the active receptor (<re> GCR <er> alpha) and/or decreasing the expression of the dominant negative receptor (<re> GCR <er> beta). We show that <el> MTX <le> increases the mRNA and protein levels of <re> GCR <er> alpha and decreases or leaves unchanged the protein expression of the <re> GCR <er> beta in CEM cells in culture. This effect was also observed in other lymphocytes (Jurkat and Raji) and in PBMNC from healthy volunteers. We also show that upon <el> MTX <le> treatment PBMC from normal volunteers exhibit a higher sensitivity to DEX inhibition on LPS-induced TNF alpha release. To explore if these actions are mediated by adenosine through the adenosine receptor A2 we evaluate the effect of adenosine on the <re> GCR <er>s expression and the effect of an A2 receptor blocker (DMPX) on <el> MTX <le> effects on <re> GCR <er>s expression. Our results show that adenosine does not mimic and DMPX can enhance <el> MTX <le> effects on these receptors. 
Estrogens have complex effects on the skeleton, including regulation of modeling and maintenance of bone mass, which vary with cell type and developmental stage. Osteoblasts are key regulators of skeletal matrix <re> synthesis <er> and degradation. However, whether osteocytes, osteoblasts or earlier progenitors mediate <el> estrogen <le> effects, and the importance of <el> estrogen <le> receptors (ERs) alpha and beta, remain unclear. To address <el> estrogen <le> response in human cells closely related to secretory osteoblasts, we studied MG63 cells with ERalpha or ERbeta reduced to low levels by stable transfection of antisense plasmids. Collagen and alkaline phosphatase expression increased with <el> estrogen <le> in wild-type and ERalpha-suppressed cells, but not in ERbeta-suppressed cells. Matrix secretion occurs as osteoblasts cease dividing, and, in keeping with this, cell proliferation was reduced by <el> estrogen <le> except in ERbeta-antisense cells. No effects of <el> estrogen <le> on wild type or ER-suppressed cells were seen in expression of BMP 2, the BMP antagonist noggin, or Indian hedgehog, products that regulate differentiation of osteoblasts. In contrast to expectations that <el> estrogen <le> would modulate bone degradation, RANKL, CSF-1, and osteoprotegerin did not respond measurably to <el> estrogen <le>, regardless of ER status. In keeping with this result, <el> estrogen <le> response was not observed in assays of osteoclast development from CD14 cells supported by wild-type or ER-silenced MG63 cells. Since <el> estrogen <le>s are major regulators of bone degradation in vivo, <el> estrogen <le> effects on osteoclasts may depend on interaction with stimuli present in bone but absent in the model studied. cDNA hybridization showed that additional <el> estrogen <le>-binding proteins including ERRalpha and BCAR3 were expressed by MG63, but <el> estrogen <le> effects in ERbeta-silenced cells were small, so these proteins are either minor regulators in MG63 cells, or act in concert with stimuli in addition to <el> estrogen <le>. 
cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) regulates the L-type calcium channel, the ryanodine receptor, and phospholamban (PLB) thereby increasing inotropy. Cardiac contractility is also regulated by <el> p38 <le> MAPK, which is a negative regulator of cardiac contractile function. The aim of this study was to identify the mechanism mediating the positive inotropic effect of <el> p38 <le> inhibition. Isolated adult and neonatal cardiomyocytes and perfused rat hearts were utilized to investigate the molecular mechanisms regulated by <el> p38 <le>. <re> PLB phosphorylation <er> was enhanced in cardiomyocytes by chemical <el> p38 <le> inhibition, by overexpression of dominant negative <el> p38 <le>α and by <el> p38 <le>α RNAi, but not with dominant negative <el> p38 <le>β. Treatment of cardiomyocytes with dominant negative <el> p38 <le>α significantly decreased Ca(2+)-transient decay time indicating enhanced sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase function and increased cardiomyocyte contractility. Analysis of signaling mechanisms involved showed that inhibition of <el> p38 <le> decreased the activity of protein phosphatase 2A, which renders protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 phosphorylated and thereby inhibits PP1. 
The homeobox transcription factor Prox1 is highly expressed in adult hepatocytes and is involved in the regulation of bile acid synthesis and gluconeogenesis in the liver by interacting with other transcriptional activators or repressors. Recent studies showed that Prox1 could inhibit proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma (<el> HCC <le>) cells and reduced Prox1 expression was associated with poor prognosis of <el> HCC <le> patients. However, the underlying mechanism by which Prox1 attenuates <el> HCC <le> growth is still unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that Prox1 induced senescence-like phenotype of <el> HCC <le> cells to reduce cell proliferation. Our results indicated that the tumor suppressor p53 is a key mediator of Prox1-induced growth suppression because Prox1 only induced senescence-like phenotype in <el> HCC <le> cells harboring wild type p53. In addition, knockdown of p53 by shRNA reversed the effect of Prox1. However, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay did not demonstrate the direct binding of Prox1 to proximal promoter of human p53 gene suggesting Prox1 might not directly activate p53 transcription. We found that Prox1 suppressed <re> Twist <er> expression in <el> HCC <le> cells and subsequently relieved its inhibition on p53 gene transcription. The involvement of <re> Twist <er> in the regulation of p53 by Prox1 was supported by the following evidence: (1) Prox1 inhibited <re> Twist <er> expression and promoter activity; (2) knockdown of <re> Twist <er> in SK-HEP-1 cells upregulated p53 expression and (3) ectopic expression of <re> Twist <er> counteracted Prox1-induced p53 transcription and senescence-like phenotype. We also indentified an E-box located at p53 promoter which is required for <re> Twist <er> to inhibit p53 expression. Finally, our animal experiment confirmed that Prox1 suppressed <el> HCC <le> growth in vivo. 
Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant <el> tumor <le> of bone and accounts for half of all primary skeletal malignancies in children and teenagers. The prognosis for patients who fail or progress on first-line chemotherapy protocols is poor, therefore, additional adjuvant therapeutic strategies are needed. A recent feasibility study has demonstrated that the nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate zoledronic acid (ZOL) can be combined safely with conventional chemotherapy. However, the pharmacodynamics of bisphosphonate therapy is not well characterized. Osteosarcoma is a highly angiogenic <el> tumor <le>. Recent reports of the anti-angiogenic effects of bisphosphonates prompted us to determine whether nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate (ZOL and alendronate) treatment attenuates osteosarcoma growth by inhibition of osteoclast activity, <el> tumor <le>-mediated <re> angiogenesis <er>, or direct inhibitory effects on osteosarcoma. Here, we demonstrate that bisphosphonates directly inhibit VEGFR2 expression in endothelial cells, as well as endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Additionally, bisphosphonates also decrease VEGF-A expression in osteosarcoma (K7M3) cells, resulting in reduced stimulation of endothelial cell migration in co-culture assays. ZOL also decreases VEGFR1 expression in aggressive osteosarcoma cell lines (K7M3, 143B) and induces apoptosis of these cells, but has negligible effects on less aggressive osteosarcoma cell lines (K12 and TE85). In vivo ZOL treatment results in significant reduction in osteosarcoma-initiated <re> angiogenesis <er> and <el> tumor <le> growth in a murine model of osteosarcoma. 
Drug-eluting stents decrease revascularization compared with bare metal stents in diabetic patients, but few studies have compared drug-eluting stent use in diabetic versus nondiabetic patients. The objective of this study was to assess whether <re> paclitaxel <er> provides equivalent revascularization decrease in diabetic and nondiabetic patients. The ARRIVE registries enrolled 7,492 patients receiving TAXUS Express stents, including 2,112 with medically treated diabetes; results were compared with those in the remaining 5,380 nondiabetic patients. Two-year target lesion revascularization (TLR) was comparable in diabetic and nondiabetic patients (8.2% vs 7.7%, p = 0.59) and remained similar after multivariate adjustment for baseline differences (7.1% vs 6.8%, p = 0.41). There were no significant TLR differences between diabetic and nondiabetic patients with small vessels (9.7% vs 9.5%, p = 0.96) or left main coronary artery, 3-vessel, or bifurcation stenting (10.7% vs 13.1%, p = 0.41). Diabetes was not a significant TLR predictor (hazard ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.77 to 1.12, p = 0.41). Stent <el> thrombosis <le> (2.6% vs 2.4%, p = 0.55) and myocardial infarction (3.8% vs 3.0%, p = 0.09) rates were also similar for diabetic and nondiabetic patients. However, 2-year mortality was significantly increased in diabetic compared with nondiabetic patients (9.7% vs 5.3%, p <0.001). Increased mortality drove significantly increased major cardiac events in diabetics; however, there was no difference in stent-related major cardiac events (8.9% vs 10.1%, p = 0.13). 
<el> FGF21 <le> decreases plasma triglycerides (TGs) in rodents and humans; however, the underlying mechanism or mechanisms are unclear. In the present study, we examined the role of <el> FGF21 <le> in production and disposal of TG-rich lipoproteins (<re> TRL <er>s) in mice. Treatment with pharmacological doses of <el> FGF21 <le> acutely reduced plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), liver TG content, and VLDL-TG secretion. In addition, metabolic turnover studies revealed that <el> FGF21 <le> facilitated the catabolism of <re> TRL <er> in white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). <el> FGF21 <le>-dependent <re> TRL <er> processing was strongly attenuated in CD36-deficient mice and transgenic mice lacking lipoprotein lipase in adipose tissues. Insulin resistance in diet-induced obese and ob/ob mice shifted <el> FGF21 <le> responses from WAT toward energy-combusting BAT. 
Previous studies have shown that <re> adenosine <er>, by activation of purinergic A2-receptors, stimulates glucagon secretion and increases vascular flow rate in isolated perfused pancreases from nondiabetic rats. Because alpha-cell function and blood flow control are known to be disturbed in diabetes, we investigated whether <re> adenosine <er> was still effective in streptozocin-induced diabetic (<el> STZ-D <le>) rats. Our experiments were performed on isolated perfused rat pancreases. Whereas, in normal rats, <re> adenosine <er> (1.65 microM) induced a 200% increase in glucagon output and a 25% rise in the pancreatic vascular flow rate, in rats diabetic for 5-6 wk, this nucleoside was ineffective on glucagon secretion, and its vasodilatory effect was strongly reduced. Long-term in vivo insulin treatment that reversed high glycemia levels was able to restore in large part both <re> adenosine <er> effects. In contrast, a short-term in vitro pretreatment with insulin was unable to restore the nucleoside effects. 
The cytokine interleukin-1 (<el> IL-1 <le>) is present in the brain and is known to cause a variety of neuroendocrine and immune effects in the rodent; the neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) plays a critical role in mediating many of these effects. Little is known about these neuropeptide interactions in the primate. We have therefore examined the effects of <el> IL-1 <le> alpha on the release of CRH in the ovariectomized rhesus monkey in vitro and in vivo. In 3 animals, the effect of <el> IL-1 <le> alpha on <re> CRH release <er> from the superfused hypothalamus was studied in vitro. The hypothalamus was divided in half and fragments from each half were superfused separately. Mean <re> CRH release <er> was 262 +/- (SE) 46 pg/20 min and increased to 1,340 +/- 470 pg/20 min after exposure to <el> IL-1 <le> alpha (p < 0.05). The effect of <el> IL-1 <le> alpha on <re> CRH release <er> into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in vivo was studied in 8 animals with chronic cannulas implanted in the lateral ventricle for <el> IL-1 <le> infusion; indwelling catheters were also placed via lumbar puncture and threaded into the cervical area for CSF collection. CSF was collected at a rate of 800 microliters/h during a 4-hour baseline period and for 4-8 h after intracerebroventricular infusion of 4.2 micrograms of <el> IL-1 <le> alpha. CRH increased significantly over time in CSF after <el> IL-1 <le> alpha infusion; the mean concentration of CRH increased from 83 +/- 17 pg/ml during the baseline period to 203 +/- 40 pg/ml after <el> IL-1 <le> alpha infusion (p < 0.01). 
The signaling cascades of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, calcineurin/NFATc4, and PI3K/Akt/GSK3, are believed to participate in endothelin-1 (ET-1)-induced cardiac <re> hypertrophy <er>. The aim of this study was to investigate whether <el> KMUP-1 <le>, a synthetic xanthine-based derivative, prevents cardiomyocyte <re> hypertrophy <er> induced by ET-1 and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. We found that in H9c2 cardiomyocytes, stimulation with ET-1 (100 nM) for 4 days induced cell <re> hypertrophy <er> and enhanced expressions of hypertrophic markers, including atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide, which were all inhibited by <el> KMUP-1 <le> in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, <el> KMUP-1 <le> prevented ET-1-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species generation determined by the DCFH-DA assay in cardiomyocytes. <el> KMUP-1 <le> also attenuated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt/GSK-3β, and activation of calcineurin/NFATc4 and RhoA/ROCK pathways induced by ET-1. Furthermore, we found that the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a stress-response enzyme implicated in cardio-protection, was up-regulated by <el> KMUP-1 <le>. Finally, <el> KMUP-1 <le> attenuated ET-1-stimulated activator protein-1 DNA binding activity. 
Cardiovascular responses to endothelin 2 (ET-2) and sarafotoxin 6b (<el> S6b <le>) were investigated in the <re> cat <er>. ET-2 (0.1-1 nmol/kg iv) decreased or elicited biphasic changes in arterial pressure (AP), whereas <el> S6b <le> (0.1-1 nmol/kg iv) only decreased AP. Central venous pressure (CVP), cardiac output (CO), and pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) were increased. ET-2 produced biphasic changes in systemic vascular resistance (SVR), whereas <el> S6b <le> decreased SVR at the two lower doses and caused a biphasic change at the 1 nmol/kg dose. The effects of ET-1 and ET-2 were similar, whereas the effects of <el> S6b <le> were similar to ET-3. ET-2 and <el> S6b <le> had small effects on right ventricular contractile force and caused transient increases in heart rate. Distal aortic blood flow was increased in response to all doses of both peptides, whereas increases in carotid blood flow were observed only in response to the higher doses of ET-2 and <el> S6b <le>. ET-2 produced dose-dependent decreases in superior mesenteric artery (SMA) blood flow, whereas decreases in SMA flow in response to <el> S6b <le> were observed only at the 1 nmol/kg dose. Renal blood flow was decreased significantly only at the higher doses of ET-2 and <el> S6b <le>. The present data show that ET-2 and <el> S6b <le> can produce both vasodilation and vasoconstriction in the systemic and regional vascular beds of the <re> cat <er> and demonstrate previously unrecognized vasodilator activity in response to <el> S6b <le>. 
Human squamous cell carcinomas frequently overexpress the epidermal growth factor receptor (<el> EGFR <le>) and this is often associated with poor prognosis in patients with these cancers. The high level of expression of the <el> EGFR <le> provides an important target for therapy and we and others have shown that monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) which block the activation of the receptor by the EGF family of ligands inhibit the growth of <el> EGFR <le> overexpressing tumours in vitro and induce the regression of established tumours grown as xenografts in athymic mice. Inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase associated with the <el> EGFR <le> have also been shown to block receptor activation and prevent tumour cell proliferation. Using the <el> EGFR <le>-overexpressing head and neck carcinoma cell line HN5, we have compared the biological consequences of treatment with an inhibitor of <el> EGFR <le> tyrosine kinase (PD153035) with anti-<el> EGFR <le> monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) ICR63 or ICR80. We found that both the anti-<el> EGFR <le> mAbs and the TK inhibitor produce similar biological changes namely, they inhibit the EGF and TGFá-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor and the growth in culture of HN5 cells. At concentrations above 100 nM, the TK inhibitor prevented the growth in culture of HN5 cells completely with an IC50 of 40 nM. With the anti-<el> EGFR <le> mAbs, growth of HN5 cells was inhibited completely at concentrations above 4 nM with an IC50 of 1 nM. More importantly we found that, like the anti-<el> EGFR <le> mAbs, treatment with the TK inhibitor directs HN5 cells to undergo <re> terminal differentiation <er> as monitored by the expression of cytokeratin 10. In addition, our results indicate that the growth inhibitory effects of the anti-<el> EGFR <le> agents also lead to induction of apoptosis as determined by 7-amino actinomycin D staining (7-AAD). 
Nephronectin (<el> NPNT <le>) is an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein involved in kidney development. We recently reported intracellular <el> NPNT <le> as a potential prognostic marker in breast cancer and that <el> NPNT <le> promotes metastasis in an integrin-dependent manner. Here, we used reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) to analyze <el> NPNT <le>-triggered intracellular signaling in the 66cl4 mouse breast cancer cell line. The results showed that the integrin-binding enhancer motif is important for the cellular effects upon <el> NPNT <le> interaction with its receptors, including phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Furthermore, analysis using prediction tools suggests involvement of <el> NPNT <le> in promoting <re> cell viability <er>. 
Menadione and diquat cause toxicity in isolated hepatocytes. The toxicities of both menadione and diquat are primarily due to redox cycling and consequent oxidative stress. Menadione toxicity, however, has another component as the compound also possesses alkylating and oxidating properties allowing it to interact directly with cellular nucleophiles. Sulfite afforded considerable protection of isolated rat hepatocytes against the toxicity of menadione. This protective effect of <el> sulfite <le> may have several components. Sulfite effectively competed with glutathione (GSH) for conjugation with menadione, sparing intracellular GSH which may continue to detoxify reactive oxygen species formed through menadione redox cycling. The menadione <el> sulfite <le> conjugate undergoes much slower redox cycling than both menadione and the menadione glutathione conjugate. Sulfite also showed some degree of protection of hepatocytes from the toxicity of diquat. Diquat is a "pure" redox cycling agent and the protective effect of <el> sulfite <le> may involve the liberation of GSH from GSSG by sulfitolysis. This would again bolster intracellular GSH levels allowing further GSH-dependent <re> detoxification <er> of reactive oxygen species through cellular GSH peroxidases. 
Congenitally immunodeficient and immunosuppressed normal mice with naturally acquired Pneumocystis carinii infection were compared as models for testing anti-P. carinii drugs. Among the immunodeficient mice, mice with severe combined immunodeficiency disease (scid), which lack B and T cells, had higher levels of P. carinii pneumonia than did microMT mice, which lack K cells. Normal mice administered dexamethasone in the drinking water had more extensive pneumocystosis than mice administered parenteral methylprednisolone or hybridoma cells making a monoclonal antibody to CD4 cells. The standard anti-P. carinii drugs trimethoprim (<el> TMP <le>)-sulfamethoxazole (<re> SMX <er>), pentamidine, and atovaquone, which work well in rats and humans, worked well in the mice. Clindamycin and primaquine were effective in the scid and microMT mice but not in the immunosuppressed normal mice. 
Many anxiolytics, anticonvulsants and general anesthetics modulate gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (<re> GABA <er>A) receptors. The anxiolytic benzodiazepines potentiate the actions of <re> GABA <er>, and this only at <re> GABA <er>A receptors with gamma subunits. The general anesthetics both potentiate <re> GABA <er> and activate <re> GABA <er>A receptors directly, but their binding sites on the receptor are poorly defined. We examined whether the gamma 2 subunit was required for the modulation of <re> GABA <er>A receptors by the general anesthetic 2,6-diisopropylphenol (<el> propofol <le>). Using the patch-clamp technique, we recorded membrane currents from HEK293 cells transfected with human alpha 2, beta 1 and gamma 2 cDNAs and with alpha 2 and beta 1 cDNAs alone. Both forms of the receptor were activated by <re> GABA <er> and by <el> propofol <le> at low concentrations. At maximal doses, <el> propofol <le> was considerably less effective than <re> GABA <er> as an activator of alpha 2 beta 1 <re> GABA <er>A receptors, but it had an efficacy similar to that of <re> GABA <er> as an activator of alpha 2 beta 1 gamma 2s receptors. In addition to activating currents directly, <el> propofol <le> potentiated currents elicited by <re> GABA <er> recorded from cells expressing either subunit combination. 
To evaluate the effects of endotoxemia on respiratory controller function, 12 subjects were randomized to receive <el> endotoxin <le> or saline; six also received ibuprofen, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, and six received placebo. Administration of <el> endotoxin <le> produced <re> fever <er>, increased respiratory frequency, decreased inspiratory time, and widened alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (all p < or = 0.001); these responses were blocked by ibuprofen. Independent of ibuprofen, <el> endotoxin <le> produced dyspnea, and it increased fractional inspiratory time, minute ventilation, and mean inspiratory flow (all p < or = 0.025). Endotoxin altered the autocorrelative behavior of respiratory frequency by increasing its autocorrelation coefficient at a lag of one breath, the number of breath lags with significant serial correlations, and its correlated fraction (all p < 0.05); these responses were blocked by ibuprofen. Changes in correlated behavior of respiratory frequency were related to changes in arterial carbon dioxide tension (r = 0.86; p < 0.03). Endotoxin decreased the oscillatory fraction of inspiratory time in both the placebo (p < 0.05) and ibuprofen groups (p = 0.06). 
Pneumonia is a major public health concern, causing significant morbidity and mortality annually, despite broad use of antimicrobial agents. Underlying many of the severe sequelae of acute lung infections is dysfunction of the immune response, which remains incompletely understood, yet is an attractive target of adjunct therapy in <re> pneumonia <er>. Here, we investigate the role of Oncostatin M (<el> OSM <le>), a pleiotropic cytokine of the IL-6 family, and how its signaling modulates multiple innate immune pathways during <re> pneumonia <er>. Previously, we have shown that <el> OSM <le> is necessary for neutrophil recruitment to the lungs during <re> pneumonia <er> by stimulating STAT3-driven CXCL5 expression. In this study, transcriptional profiling of whole lung <re> pneumonia <er> with <el> OSM <le> neutralization revealed 241 differentially expressed genes following only 6 hours of infection. Many downregulated genes are associated with STAT1, STAT3, and interferon signaling, suggesting these pathways are induced by <el> OSM <le> early in <re> pneumonia <er>. Interestingly, STAT1 and STAT3 activation was subsequently upregulated with <el> OSM <le> neutralization by 24 hours, suggesting that <el> OSM <le> interruption dysregulates these central signaling pathways. When we investigated the source of <el> OSM <le> in <re> pneumonia <er>, neutrophils, and to a lesser extent, macrophages, appear to be primary sources, suggesting a positive feedback loop of <el> OSM <le> production by neutrophils. 
In order to characterize the receptor subtype mediating acetylcholine (<el> ACh <le>)-induced <re> cortisol secretion <er> from purified bovine adrenocortical zona fasciculata/reticularis cells in primary culture, the potencies of a range of selective muscarinic antagonists of <el> ACh <le>-induced steroidogenesis were assessed by Schild analysis. Basal secretion of cortisol was 10.2 +/- 1.4 pmol/well/30 min. <el> ACh <le> stimulated a dose-dependent increase in <re> cortisol secretion <er> and was maximally effective at 10(-5) M, at which concentration <re> cortisol secretion <er> was 143.4 +/- 12.9 pmol/well/30 min. Hexahydro-sila-difenidol and para-fluoro-hexa-hydro-sila-difenidol were potent competitive antagonists of <el> ACh <le>-stimulated <re> cortisol secretion <er>, with pA2 values of 8.68 +/- 0.28 and 7.96 +/- 0.29, respectively. Pirenzepine (pA2 = 6.95 +/- 0.28) and methoctramine (pA2 = 6.06 +/- 0.27) were relatively weak competitive antagonists. 
This study examines the receptor mechanisms by which dopamine (DA) inhibits <re> Na <er>(+)-K(+)-adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) activity in single permeabilized proximal tubule (PCT). <re> Na <er>(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity was inhibited in the presence of both <el> DA1 <le>- and DA2-specific agonists but not by either agonist alone. The inhibition induced by DA (10(-6) M) was attenuated in the presence of either of the two DA2-specific antagonists S-sulpiride and YM 09151 at 10(-5) M and in the presence of the <el> DA1 <le> antagonist SCH 23390 (10(-5) M). PCT adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) levels were significantly increased in the presence of DA and <el> DA1 <le> agonist, but DA2 agonist had no effect on cell cAMP levels. <re> Na <er>(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity was significantly inhibited in PCT incubated with DA2 agonist (10(-5) M) and dibutyryl (DB)-cAMP (10(-6) M) but not with DA2 agonist (10(-5) M) only. PCT <re> Na <er>(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity was also significantly inhibited in the presence of both DA2 agonist (10(-5) M) and forskolin (10(-6) M). Neither DBcAMP (10(-6) M) nor forskolin (10(-6) M) alone inhibited <re> Na <er>(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity. In tubules incubated with DA (10(-8) to 10(-9) M), the presence of DBcAMP (10(-6) M) enhanced the sensitivity by which DA inhibited <re> Na <er>(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity. 
After uptake into liver cells, the antiemetic drugs <re> tropisetron <er> and ondansetron undergo metabolic inactivation by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). We investigated whether the hepatic organic cation transporter 1 (<el> OCT1 <le>; SLC22A1) mediates cellular uptake and whether common <el> OCT1 <le> loss-of-function polymorphisms affect pharmacokinetics and efficacy of both drugs. Both <re> tropisetron <er> and ondansetron inhibited ASP(+) uptake in <el> OCT1 <le>-overexpressing HEK293 cells. Overexpression of wild-type, but not <el> OCT1 <le> loss-of-function variants, significantly increased <re> tropisetron <er> uptake. Correspondingly, patients with two loss-of-function <el> OCT1 <le> alleles had higher <re> tropisetron <er> plasma concentrations (n=59, P<0.04) and higher clinical efficacy (n=91, P=0.009) compared with carriers of fully active <el> OCT1 <le>. Overexpression of <el> OCT1 <le> did not increase ondansetron uptake. Nevertheless, <el> OCT1 <le> genotypes correlated with pharmacokinetics (n=45, P<0.05) and clinical efficacy (n=222, P<0.02) of ondansetron, the effect size of <el> OCT1 <le> genotypes on pharmacokinetics and efficacy was greater for <re> tropisetron <er> than for ondansetron. 
We studied mechanisms governing production of the neutral proteinase <re> collagenase <er> by synovial cells. We used a model system of monolayer cultures of rabbit synovial fibroblasts stimulated to produce <re> collagenase <er> by treatment with phorbol <el> myristate <le> acetate or crystals of monosodium urate monohydrate. mRNAs from these and untreated cells were translated in a wheat germ cell-free system. Collagenase was not present in the culture medium or in the in vitro translation products of mRNA from untreated cells but was present in both the medium and translation products of stimulated cells, as analyzed by gel electrophoresis and immunoprecipitation with monospecific antibody. Induction of <re> collagenase <er> was prevented by treatment of the cells with alpha-amanitin (2 mug/ mL), an inhibitor of mRNA synthesis. 
The growth factor <el> GM-CSF <le> has an important role in pulmonary surfactant metabolism and the regulation of antibacterial activities of lung sentinel cells. However, the potential of intra-alveolar <el> GM-CSF <le> to augment lung protective <re> immunity <er> against inhaled bacterial pathogens has not been defined in preclinical infection models. We hypothesized that transient overexpression of <el> GM-CSF <le> in the lungs of mice by adenoviral gene transfer (Ad-<el> GM-CSF <le>) would protect mice from subsequent lethal pneumococcal pneumonia. Our data show that intra-alveolar delivery of Ad-<el> GM-CSF <le> led to sustained increased pSTAT5 expression and PU.1 protein expression in alveolar macrophages during a 28-d observation period. Pulmonary Ad-<el> GM-CSF <le> delivery 2-4 wk prior to infection of mice with Streptococcus pneumoniae significantly reduced mortality rates relative to control vector-treated mice. This increased survival was accompanied by increased inducible NO synthase expression, antibacterial activity, and a significant reduction in caspase-3-dependent apoptosis and secondary necrosis of lung sentinel cells. Importantly, therapeutic treatment of mice with rGM-CSF improved lung protective <re> immunity <er> and accelerated bacterial clearance after pneumococcal challenge. 
<el> DsbA <le> and DsbC proteins involved in the periplasmic formation of <re> disulfide <er> bonds in Pseudomonas aeruginosa were identified and shown to play an important role for the formation of extracellular enzymes. Mutants deficient in either dsbA or dsbC or both genes were constructed, and extracellular elastase, alkaline phosphatase, and lipase activities were determined. The dsbA mutant no longer produced these enzymes, whereas the lipase activity was doubled in the dsbC mutant. Also, extracellar lipase production was severely reduced in a P. aeruginosa dsbA mutant in which an inactive <el> DsbA <le> variant carrying the mutation C34S was expressed. Even when the lipase gene lipA was constitutively expressed in trans in a lipA dsbA double mutant, lipase activity in cell extracts and culture supernatants was still reduced to about 25%. Interestingly, the presence of dithiothreitol in the growth medium completely inhibited the formation of extracellular lipase whereas the addition of dithiothreitol to a cell-free culture supernatant did not affect lipase activity. 
Occupational exposure to low-molecular-weight (LMW) allergens such as acid anhydrides can result in occupational <re> asthma <er>, an allergic disease characterized by episodic airway obstruction, airways inflammation, and non specific airways hyperresponsiveness. Since LMW irritants can provoke rather similar effects and since most, if not all, LMW allergens have irritant properties, this study addressed the distinction between allergenic and irritant effects of the respiratory allergen trimellitic anhydride (<el> TMA <le>). BN rats were sensitized by dermal application of <el> TMA <le> or vehicle alone and 3 weeks later were challenged by inhalation of a slightly irritating concentration of <el> TMA <le> or the vehicle. Lung function was measured before, during, and shortly after challenge. One day after challenge, in vivo and in vitro nonspecific airways hyperresponsiveness to methacholine was measured, and bronchoalveolar lavage was performed to measure total protein, lactate dehydrogenase, N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, and total and differential leukocyte numbers in the fluid. In addition, IgE measurements and histopathological examinations of the respiratory tract were carried out. <el> TMA <le> challenge of sensitized, but not sham-sensitized, BN rats reduced breathing frequency during challenge, elevated total and <el> TMA <le>-specific serum IgE levels, and caused a typical allergic <re> asthma <er>-associated airway pathology, as observed earlier. Vehicle challenge did not cause these effects, irrespective of sensitization. Hyperresponsiveness to methacholine was only seen in <el> TMA <le>-sensitized and -challenged rats. These rats also showed increased levels of the biochemical parameters and increased numbers of eosinophils and neutrophils in the lung lavage fluid; <el> TMA <le> challenge of sham-sensitized rats caused similar but markedly less pronounced effects. During <el> TMA <le> challenge of sham-sensitized rats, a breathing pattern typical of irritation was noticed but a clearly distinct pattern was seen upon <el> TMA <le> challenge of sensitized rats. 
Anaesthetic agents were confirmed to play a role on the tumor angiogenesis. The effect of sevoflurane on tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) cell has not been investigated. SCC-4 cells were exposed to sevoflurane after simulating <el> hypoxia <le>. Then, both the mRNA and protein level of <el> hypoxia <le>-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and VEGF were detected. The methylation states of the VEGF promoter region were also assessed to reveal the underlying mechanism. Finally, the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) was administrated to reveal the relationship of DNA methylation on the regulation of the <re> VEGF level <er>. Results showed that sevoflurane attenuated the <el> hypoxia <le>-induced <re> VEGF level <er> without altering the HIF-1α after exposure for 24 and 72 h. Sevoflurane increased the DNA methylation of the VEGF promoter region. The attenuation effect of sevoflurane on <el> hypoxia <le>-induced <re> VEGF level <er> could be blocked by 5-Aza. 
Oleanolic acid (OA) is a natural triterpenoid and has been demonstrated to protect against varieties of hepatotoxicants. Recently, however, OA at high doses was reported to produce apparent <el> cholestasis <le> in mice. In this study, we characterized the protective effect of OA at low doses against lithocholic acid (LCA)-induced <el> cholestasis <le> in mice and explored further mechanisms. OA cotreatment (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly improved mouse survival rate, attenuated liver necrosis, and decreased serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase; more importantly, serum total bile acids and bilirubin, as well as hepatic total bile acids were also remarkably reduced. Gene and protein expression analysis showed that hepatic expression of multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2), <re> Mrp3 <er>, and Mrp4 was significantly increased by OA cotreatment, whereas other bile acid metabolism- and transport-related genes, including Na+/taurocholate cotransporter, organic anion transporter 1b2, bile salt export pump, multidrug resistance protein 3, Cyp3a11, Cyp2b10, Sulfotransferase 2a1 (Sult2a1), and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1a1 (Ugt1a1), were only slightly changed. OA also caused increased nuclear factor-E2-related factor (Nrf2) mRNA expression and nuclear protein accumulation, whereas nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor (FXR), pregnane X receptor (PXR), and constitutive androstane receptor were not significantly influenced by OA. Luciferase (Luc) assays performed in HepG2 cells illustrated that OA was a strong Nrf2 agonist with moderate PXR and weak FXR agonism. Finally, in mouse primary cultured hepatocytes, OA dose- and time-dependently induced expression of Mrp2, <re> Mrp3 <er>, and Mrp4; however, this upregulation was abrogated when Nrf2 was silenced. 
Freshly isolated rat colonic mucosa close to anus (the late distal colonic mucosa) was used to investigate the effect of dopamine on the rat late distal colonic ion transport by means of short-circuit current (I(SC)) recording and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) analysis. The results showed that the basolateral addition of dopamine (0.1-1000 micromol/l) produced a concentration-dependent downward deflection in I(SC) with an apparent EC(50) of 20.06 micromol/l in the late distal colon. The dopamine-induced I(SC) decrease was abolished by bilateral removal of Cl(-) or <re> HCO <er>(3)(-), apical Cl(-) replacement and apical pretreatment with non-specific Cl(-) channel blocker/transporter inhibitor, DPC (1 mmol/l) or glibenclamide (1 mmol/l), and reversed by subsequent addition of glibenclamide. Removal of basolateral Na(+) or reducing basolateral <re> HCO <er>(3)(-) (3 mmol/l) as well as basolateral pretreatment with DIDS (4,4'-didsothio- cyanostilbene-2, 2'-disulfonic acid) (250 micromol/l), an inhibitor of NBC or AE, could also inhibit the dopamine-induced I(SC) response. However, apical pretreatment with epithelial Na(+) channel blocker, amiloride (10 micromol/l), Ca(2+)-dependent Cl(-) channel blocker/<el> anion <le> exchanger, DIDS (100 micromol/l), or putative K(+) blockers such as Ba(2+) (5 mmol/l), TEA (tetraethylammonium) (5 mmol/l) or 293B (trans-6-cyano-4- (N-ethylsulfonyl-N-methylamino)-3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-chromane) (10 micromol/l) did not significantly affect the dopamine-induced I(SC) response. RT-PCR results showed the expression of <el> anion <le> exchanger, SLC26A3, but not SLC26A6, in rat late distal colon. 
The effect of <el> leptin <le> on <re> insulin secretion <er> is controversial due to conflicting results in the literature. In the present study, we incubated insulin-producing rat insulinoma INS-1 cells for 60 min and examined the effects of recombinant murine <el> leptin <le> (20 nmol/l). We found that <el> leptin <le> (0.1-100 nmol/l) did not affect the insulin response to glucose (1-20 mmol/l). However, when cells were incubated with agents that increase the intracellular content of cAMP, i.e., glucagon-like peptide-1 (100 nmol/l), pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (100 nmol/l), forskolin (2.5 micromol/l), dibutyryl-cAMP (1 mmol/l), or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (100 micromol/l), <el> leptin <le> significantly reduced <re> insulin secretion <er> (by 34-58%, P < 0.05-0.001). In contrast, when <re> insulin secretion <er> was stimulated by the cholinergic agonist carbachol (100 micromol/l) or the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (1 micromol/l), both of which activate protein kinase C, <el> leptin <le> was without effect. 
The global use of organophosphorus compounds (OP) for pest control and nerve agents being used in military conflicts and for assassinations renders intoxications by these agents a public health concern. OP-poisoned patients often suffer from dysrhythmias which may ultimately result in death. In this study, human-induced pluripotent stem cells derived cardiomyocytes were exposed to OP compounds in a microelectrode array system (MEA). The MEA system is widely accepted to assess the proarrhythmic properties of (candidate) drugs. The directly acting cholinergic compounds acetylcholine and <el> carbachol <le> and the irreversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor cyclosarin - a highly toxic nerve agent - were assessed. All three compounds induced a dose-dependent (up to 600 nmol/L) corrected field potential duration (<re> FPDc <er>) prolongation of 9.7 ± 0.6% for <el> carbachol <le>, for 9.7 ± 1.2% acetylcholine and 9.4 ± 0.5% for cyclosarin. Additionally, the electrophysiological alterations of the clinically approved oxime reactivators obidoxime, pralidoxime and the oximes in development HI-6 and MMB-4 were investigated in the absence of OP. Neither of these oximes (up to a concentration of 300 μmol/L) caused dysrhythmia nor beat arrest. The competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine as a cornerstone in the treatment of OP poisoning was also analyzed. Interestingly, atropine caused a drop in the beat rate which might result from a non-receptor action of this substance in the absence of OP. Atropine in combination with the OP nerve agent cyclosarin and the direct cholinergics acetylcholine or carabachol completely reversed the induced <re> FPDc <er> prolongation. However, the oxime HI-6 as potent reactivator of cyclosarin-inhibited AChE was not able to prevent the <re> FPDc <er> prolongation in this model. 
Immunological responses in human intestinal allografts are poorly understood and accurate diagnosis of acute cellular rejection remains difficult. Here, human intestinal allografts were analyzed by multi-color quantitative fluorescent immunohistochemical morphometry in order to monitor the clinical course of rejection. Morphometry gave two-dimensional plots based on size and circularity, and identified phenotypes of individual cells infiltrating the allograft by fluorescent staining. Using this method, invariant TCRVα24(+) NKT (iNKT) cells were observed in the intestinal allograft during rejection. Because these were not identified in the normal donor intestine before surgery, this finding was considered to be a signature of acute cellular rejection of the intestinal allograft. Infiltrating iNKT cells released IL-4 and <el> IL-5 <le>, Th2-related cytokines that antagonize the Th1 responses that induce acute cellular rejection. Histological observation suggested eosinophilic <re> enteritis <er> in the mucosa with elevation of IL-4 and <el> IL-5 <le>. 
Everolimus (<el> EVL <le>), one of the mammalian targets of rapamycin, is a next generation immunosuppressant that may have accessory anti-proliferative effects in heart transplant (HTx) recipients. However, little is known about the clinical relationship between <el> EVL <le> and regression of cardiac <re> hypertrophy <er>. A total of 42 HTx recipients received <el> EVL <le> therapy at post-HTx 150 days on median and had been followed at our institute for > 1 year between 2008 and 2014 [<el> EVL <le> (+) group]. We also observed 18 patients without <el> EVL <le> from post-HTx 150 days for 1 year [<el> EVL <le> (-) group]. There were no significant differences in baseline variables between the two groups. Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and the ratio of early transmitral filling velocity to the peak early diastolic mitral annular motion velocity (E/e') decreased significantly during 1-year <el> EVL <le> treatment compared with the <el> EVL <le> (-) group. There were no differences in blood pressure and medications between the 2 groups. Improvement of LVMI and the E/e' ratio was not associated with trough levels of calcineurin inhibitors or <el> EVL <le>, but correlated with each baseline value. 
In late gestation, morphological maturation of fetal lung includes septal thinning of potential airspaces, a process accelerated by exogenous glucocorticoids. Apoptosis occurs in normal fetal lung. Glucocorticoids increase <re> apoptosis <er> in several tissues. The authors hypothesized that exogenous glucocorticoids would increase <re> apoptosis <er> in fetal lung, primarily in the interstitium. They administered <el> dexamethasone <le> (DEX), 1 mg/kg, or vehicle (Control) to pregnant rats at 19 days of gestation. Fetuses were delivered at 3, 7, 12, or 24 hours post injection. DEX decreased fetal body weight and lung weight, DNA, and protein 12 hours post injection. Using the terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) reaction to label apoptotic cells in lung, they calculated an apoptotic index (AI, apoptotic cells/1000 total cells) for each fetus. Average DEX AI (3.6+/-2.6, mean+/-SD) was greater than Control (1.7+/-0.5) (P<.02). All DEX AIs were greater than Control AIs at 3, 7, and 12 hours, but were similar to Controls at 24 hours post injection. Apoptotic cells appeared to be interstitial, based on colocalization with vimentin staining. Presence of apoptotic cells was confirmed by electron microscopy and detection of the nucleosomal ladder pattern on DNA electrophoresis. 
Estradiol is considered to be a critical factor in the growth induction of some breast cancer cells, like MCF-7 cell line. Among other compounds involved in the control of neoplastic mammary cell growth, <el> cAMP <le> has been suggested, on the other hand, to exert an antiproliferative effect. Sex steroid binding protein (<re> SBP <er>) sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), the plasma carrier for both androgens and estradiol, recognizes a specific receptor located on membranes of estrogen- and androgen-sensitive tissue and cultured cells (e.g. MCF-7 cell). The interaction of estradiol with the receptor-bound <re> SBP <er> has been reported to induce a significant accumulation of <el> cAMP <le> in MCF-7 cells; in addition, a negative modulation of estradiol induced proliferation of these cells has been described after treatment with <re> SBP <er>. We report here a more detailed observation about the effect of <re> SBP <er> on MCF-7 cell estradiol-induced growth as well as the possible linkage between <re> SBP <er> and its membrane receptor and protein kinase A activity. MCF-7 cell growth was induced by estradiol, but the effect of estradiol was completely abolished by cell treatment with both <re> SBP <er> and estradiol. The inhibitory effect of <re> SBP <er> was highly specific. Because it was suggested that <re> SBP <er> might act through <el> cAMP <le>, we investigated the effect of <re> SBP <er> and estradiol in cells treated with protein kinase A inhibitor peptide (6-22) amide, a specific inhibitor of the <el> cAMP <le> target protein kinase A. The blockade of PKA had no effect on estradiol action on cell growth but masked completely the effect of <re> SBP <er> because MCF-7 increased growth sustained by estradiol was fully detectable also in the presence of <re> SBP <er>. We also observed that MCF-7 cells treated with increasing doses of 8Br-<el> cAMP <le>, <el> cAMP <le> analog and PKA activator, showed a progressive reduction of their growth. 8Br-<el> cAMP <le> was also able to inhibit estradiol promotion of MCF-7 cell growth. The inhibitory effect of 8Br-<el> cAMP <le> on estradiol-induced proliferation was already detectable at analog concentration of 100 nM, which has been reported to be the level reached by <el> cAMP <le> in MCF-7 cells treated with <re> SBP <er> and estradiol. 
Luminal <re> histamine <er> concentrations can be very high in the intestine without eliciting clinical histaminosis. The intestinal mechanisms that possibly prevent systemic intoxication by luminal <re> histamine <er> were investigated in the present study. Porcine colonic epithelia were mounted in Ussing chambers. After unilateral application of partially (3)H-labelled <re> histamine <er>, mucosal-to-serosal (MS) and serosal-to-mucosal (SM) flux rates were calculated from the contralateral appearance of <re> histamine <er> and the radioactive <re> histamine <er> label (hist-rad; representing <re> histamine <er> plus catabolites). A discrepancy between <re> histamine <er> and hist-rad fluxes was observed in both flux directions, indicating efficient <re> histamine <er> catabolism at all <re> histamine <er> concentrations tested (5, 50 and 100 microM). Catabolism exceeded 65% at 100 microM <re> histamine <er> and reached approximately 100% at 5 microM <re> histamine <er>. Blockade of <el> <re> histamine <er> N-methyltransferase <le> by amodiaquin (100 microM) abolished catabolism completely, whereas blockade of diamine oxidase by aminoguanidine (100 microM) was less effective. MS fluxes of <re> histamine <er> and hist-rad correlated with mannitol fluxes. Mast cell stimulation with the calcium ionophore A23187 (1 microM) induced a twofold larger <re> histamine <er> appearance on the serosal side than the mucosal application of 100 microM <re> histamine <er>. 
The <el> ATP <le>-gated <re> P2X7 <er> cell surface receptor belongs to the P2X purinoreceptor family, and is expressed abundantly by immune cells. This receptor is involved in several inflammatory and immunological processes, including the secretion of IL-1 by activated macrophages. Here, we demonstrate that CD27, a cell surface molecule, which is involved in the interaction between immune cells and implicated in the immunological memory of the T and B cells, is released rapidly upon treatment with low <el> ATP <le> concentrations, via the activation of the <re> P2X7 <er> receptor. The surface expression of CD27 on the T and B cells has been shown to be down-regulated as the result of <el> ATP <le> treatment, and the soluble form of CD27 was detected readily in the supernatants of splenocytes, which were cultured along with <el> ATP <le> treatment. The shedding of CD27 was blocked by KN-62, a chemical <re> P2X7 <er> inhibitor, and was also efficiently triggered by treatment with 2,3-O-(4-benzoyl-benzoyl)-<el> ATP <le>. The shedding of CD27 from mouse splenic T cells was observed to occur within 5 min of treatment with 300 microM <el> ATP <le>, whereas treatment with PMA or ionomycin was not determined to trigger the shedding of CD27 until treatment had been applied for a period of at least 2 h. The <el> ATP <le>-induced shedding of CD27 was inhibited by treatment with the matrix metalloprotease inhibitor, GM6001, but not by treatments with BAPTA-AM, wortmannin, SB202190, or PD 98059. 
In normal <re> men <er>, chronic testosterone (T) administration results in negative feedback suppression of gonadotropin and sperm production. However, azoospermia is achieved in only 50-70% of <re> men <er> treated with high dosages of T. Furthermore, the relative sensitivity of LH and FSH secretion to chronic administration of more physiological dosages of T is unclear. We determined whether a T dosage higher than those previously given would be more or less effective in suppressing spermatogenesis and whether, within the physiological range, T would exert a more selective effect on LH than on FSH secretion. After a 4- to 6-month control period, 51 normal <re> men <er> were randomly assigned to treatment groups (n = 9-12/group) receiving either sesame oil (1 mL) or T <el> enanthate <le> (25, 50, 100, or 300 mg, im) weekly for 6 months. Monthly LH and FSH levels by RIA and twice monthly sperm counts were determined. During treatment, T levels were measured daily between two weekly injections. Chronic T administration in physiological to moderately supraphysiological dosages resulted in parallel dose-dependent suppression of LH, FSH, and sperm production. T <el> enanthate <le> (50 mg/week) suppressed LH and FSH levels and sperm counts to 50% of those in placebo-treated <re> men <er> (ED50). T <el> enanthate <le> (300 mg/week), was no more effective than 100 mg/week in suppressing LH, FSH, and sperm production. Serum T levels in <re> men <er> who received 100 and 300 mg/week T <el> enanthate <le> were 1.5- and 3-fold higher than those in placebo-treated <re> men <er>, respectively. Except for mild truncal acne, weight gain, and increases in hematocrit, we detected no significant adverse health effects of chronic high dosage T administration. 
Recently, the oncoprotein MDM-2 was implicated in the transforming growth factor-beta (<el> TGF-beta <le>) growth inhibitory pathway by the finding that prolonged, constitutive expression of MDM-2 in mink lung epithelial cells could overcome the antiproliferative effect of <el> TGF-beta <le> (Sun, P., Dong, P., Dai, K., Hannon, G. J., and Beach, D. (1998) Science 282, 2270-2272). However, using Mv1Lu cells conditionally expressing MDM-2, we found that MDM-2 does not overcome <el> TGF-beta <le>-mediated growth arrest. No detectable changes were observed in various <el> TGF-beta <le> responses, including cell cycle arrest, activation of transcriptional reporters, and <el> TGF-beta <le>-dependent Smad2/3 nuclear accumulation. This finding was in direct contrast to the effect of forcing <re> c-Myc <er> expression, a bona fide member of the <el> TGF-beta <le> growth inhibitory pathway, which renders cells refractory to <el> TGF-beta <le>-induced cell cycle arrest. Our results suggest that an MDM-2-dependent increase in cell cycle progression may allow the acquisition of additional mutations over time and that these alterations then allow cells to evade a <el> TGF-beta <le>-mediated growth arrest. 
Both prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) and LHRH inhibit LH-stimulated cAMP accumulation and progesterone secretion in the intact luteal cell, but have no effect on LH-sensitive <el> adenylate cyclase <le> activity in isolated membranes. The present studies were conducted to assess the possibility that calcium (<re> Ca2 <er>+) may mediate the inhibitory activity of PGF2 alpha and LHRH in the rat luteal cell. Removal of extracellular <re> Ca2 <er>+ significantly enhanced cAMP accumulation in response to LH by about 2-fold, but blunted LH-stimulated progesterone secretion. Incubation of luteal cells with A23187 caused a highly significant and dose-related decrease in LH-stimulated cAMP accumulation with a concentration for half-maximal inhibition (IC50) of about 1 microM. No effect of A23187 was seen on LH-sensitive <el> adenylate cyclase <le> activity, but the ionophore elicited significant inhibition of LH-stimulated intracellular cAMP accumulation in the presence of isobutyl-methylxanthine (MIX), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Inhibition by A23187 was <re> Ca2 <er>+ dependent, since a decrease in extracellular <re> Ca2 <er>+ to less than 100 microM completely blocked the effect of the ionophore. A23187 also significantly inhibited LH-stimulated progesterone secretion in response to LH or cholera toxin and inhibited cholera toxin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in the absence or presence of MIX. In incubations of isolated luteal membranes, <re> Ca2 <er>+ produced a dose-dependent inhibition of LH-stimulated <el> adenylate cyclase <le> activity in the absence or presence of MIX at free <re> Ca2 <er>+ levels between 5-20 microM (IC50, approximately 10 microM). Depletion of extracellular <re> Ca2 <er>+ had no effect on inhibition of LH-stimulated cAMP accumulation by PGF2 alpha in the intact cell, and the inhibitory activity of LHRH was slightly reduced, but not abolished, by depletion of extracellular <re> Ca2 <er>+. Verapamil, a <re> Ca2 <er>+ channel blocker, had no effect on inhibition of LH-stimulated cAMP accumulation by PGF2 alpha or LHRH. It is concluded that an acute increase in intracellular <re> Ca2 <er>+ inhibits activation of <el> adenylate cyclase <le> by LH in the rat luteal cell. 
We have previously demonstrated that prostaglandin F(2alpha) (<el> PGF <le>(2alpha)) induces a rapid and transient expression of Nur77 in luteal cells. We have shown that Nur77 plays an important role in ovarian physiology by mediating the <el> PGF <le>(2alpha) induction of 20alpha-HSD, a steroidogenic enzyme involved in the catabolism of progesterone. In this report we established, using luteinized granulosa cells, that <el> PGF <le>(2alpha) stimulates in vitro <re> nur77 <er> expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Serial 5'-deletion of the <re> nur77 <er> promoter revealed that the necessary and sufficient elements for <el> PGF <le>(2alpha) induction of Nur77 promoter activity are located between the nucleotides -86 and -33 upstream of the transcription start site, this region containing two AP1 elements. JunD binds to these AP1 sites, but its binding is not stimulated by <el> PGF <le>(2alpha). However, mutation of the AP1 sites as well as a dominant-negative JunD abolished <re> nur77 <er> induction by <el> PGF <le>(2alpha). <el> PGF <le>(2alpha) induces phosphorylation of JunD bound to the <re> nur77 <er> promoter. Stimulation of <re> nur77 <er> expression and JunD phosphorylation were prevented by inhibitors of calcium, calmodulin, or ERK1/2 kinase. <el> PGF <le>(2alpha)-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was prevented by calcium/calmodulin inhibitors. 
Substance P (<el> SP <le>) and somatostatin (<re> SOM <er>) are made at mucosal surfaces and sites of inflammation. There is a <el> SP <le>/<re> SOM <er> immunoregulatory circuit that modulates the IFN-gamma response in murine schistosomiasis. <el> SP <le> enhances, while <re> SOM <er> decreases, IFN-gamma secretion. Various inflammatory mediators induce macrophages to make <re> SOM <er>, but no known factor limits this expression. It was discovered that <el> SP <le> regulates <re> SOM <er> synthesis. Splenocytes from normal, uninfected mice cultured with LPS, IFN-gamma, or IL-10 for 4 h strongly expressed <re> SOM <er> mRNA, but failed to do so in the presence of <el> SP <le>. The inhibition with 10(-9) M <el> SP <le> was > 85% shown by quantitative PCR. Also, splenocyte <re> SOM <er> content decreased from 1048 +/- 275 to < 10 pg/4 x 10(8) cells following <el> SP <le> exposure. Immunohistochemistry identified <re> SOM <er> solely within splenic macrophages following cytokine stimulation. Mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni form granulomas in the liver and intestines resulting from deposition of parasite eggs in these organs. The granulomas contain macrophages that make <re> SOM <er> constitutively. <el> SP <le> at 10(-8) M decreased <re> SOM <er> mRNA expression > 90% in dispersed granuloma cells cultured for 4 h or longer. Specific <el> SP <le> receptor antagonists blocked <el> SP <le> suppression of <re> SOM <er> expression in splenocytes and dispersed granuloma cells, showing that an authentic <el> SP <le> receptor mediated the regulation. Additional studies revealed that IL-4 antagonized the <el> SP <le> effect in the spleen. 
In this randomized, double-blind, controlled study, we tested the hypothesis that the short-acting beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists <el> esmolol <le> and landiolol suppress hemodynamic changes and bispectral index (BIS) increases, both of which are induced by tracheal intubation under general anesthesia with sevoflurane alone. Forty-five patients were randomly assigned to the control, <el> esmolol <le>, and landiolol groups (n = 15 each). Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane in oxygen, with an end-tidal concentration maintained at 1 minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration (<re> MAC <er>). Infusion of saline (control group), <el> esmolol <le> (bolus of 1 mg/kg and then 0.25 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1); <el> esmolol <le> group), or landiolol (bolus of 0.125 mg/kg and then 0.04 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1); landiolol group) was started 5 min after the induction of anesthesia and was continued throughout the study. Tracheal intubation was performed 12 min after anesthesia induction. There were no differences in overall changes of mean arterial blood pressure among the three groups, whereas, at 1-5 min after tracheal intubation, heart rate increased in all groups but was significantly slower in the <el> esmolol <le> and landiolol groups than in the control group (P < 0.05). BIS was between 96 and 98 for all patients at baseline and decreased during the induction of anesthesia. There were no differences in BIS among the three groups before laryngoscopy (39 +/- 5, 39 +/- 5, and 38 +/- 4 in the control, <el> esmolol <le>, and landiolol groups, respectively). BIS increased significantly in the control group (54 +/- 10; P < 0.05) 1 min after intubation, whereas it remained unchanged in the <el> esmolol <le> and landiolol groups (45 +/- 10 and 41 +/- 6, respectively). 
Collagen-induced polyarthritis in rats is a new experimental model that shares clinical and histologic features with adjuvant <re> arthritis <er>. To determine whether <el> collagen <le>-induced <re> arthritis <er> is a form of adjuvant disease and to further exclude contamination of <el> collagen <le> with an adjuvant substance, native type II <el> collagen <le> was studied for adjuvant properties. IgM and IgG PFC activity and PBMC [3H]TdR incorporation were studied in rats after injection with TNP-OA combined with IFA, IFA and CII, or CFA. In general, humoral and CMI responses to TNP-OA were lower in rats injected with IFA/CII compared with those with IFA; the presence of CII during primary immunization failed to significantly enhance PFC activity to TNP after a boost. CFA-injected rats gave maximal values in both studies. Mice pretreated with BII in the absence of oil gave PFC responses below control after sensitization with SRC. Furthermore, CII was unable to replace mycobacteria in the induction of EAE in rats and was devoid of mitogenic or polyclonal stimulatory properties. 
Actin cytoskeleton remodeling is well known to be positively involved in <el> glucose <le>-stimulated pancreatic β cell insulin secretion. We have observed <el> glucose <le>-stimulated focal adhesion remodeling at the β cell surface and have shown this to be crucial for <el> glucose <le>-stimulated insulin secretion. However, the mechanistic link between such remodeling and the insulin secretory machinery remained unknown and was the major aim of this study. MIN6B1 cells, a previously validated model of primary β cell function, were used for all experiments. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy revealed the <el> glucose <le>-responsive co-localization of focal adhesion kinase (<re> FAK <er>) and paxillin with integrin β1 at the basal cell surface after short term stimulation. In addition, blockade of the interaction between β1 integrins and the extracellular matrix with an anti-β1 integrin antibody (Ha2/5) inhibited short term <el> glucose <le>-induced phosphorylation of <re> FAK <er> (Tyr-397), paxillin (Tyr-118), and ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204). Pharmacological inhibition of <re> FAK <er> activity blocked <el> glucose <le>-induced actin cytoskeleton remodeling and <el> glucose <le>-induced disruption of the F-actin/SNAP-25 association at the plasma membrane as well as the distribution of insulin granules to regions in close proximity to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, <re> FAK <er> inhibition also completely blocked short term <el> glucose <le>-induced activation of the Akt/AS160 signaling pathway. 
Sublytic doses of complement desensitize cells and make them resistant to lytic complement doses. This process, named complement-induced protection, requires calcium ion influx, protein kinase C activation and protein synthesis. The involvement of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase, <re> ERK <er>, in cell desensitization by sublytic complement was examined in erythroleukaemia K562 cells and in COS-7 cells. As shown here, <re> ERK <er> is activated in K562 and COS-7 cells within 10 min of sublytic immune attack and then shows a decline and a second peak of activation at 20 min. C7- and C8-deficient human sera have a small effect on <re> ERK <er> activity. However, a significant increase in <re> ERK <er> activation is observed when C7 or C8, respectively, is added back to these sera. Complement-induced <re> ERK <er> activation was blocked in cells treated with GF109203X or Go6976, two selective <el> PKC <le> inhibitors, as well as by treatment with PD098059, an inhibitor of MEK1, the <re> ERK <er> kinase. PD098059 treatment also sensitized K562 cells to complement-mediated lysis and prevented complement-induced protection. COS-7 cells transfected with a dominant-negative MEK plasmid were incapable of undergoing the process of complement-induced protection. 
Hepatocyte growth factor (<el> HG <le>F) is a potential therapeutic agent for diabetic nephropathy. The mechanisms for the renoprotective effect of <el> HG <le>F have been studied extensively, but antioxidant signalling of <el> HG <le>F in diabetic nephropathy is minimally understood. Our observations indicated that a nitrated guanine nucleotide, 8-nitroguanosine 3'5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-nitro-cGMP) diminished in high glucose (<el> HG <le>)-treated rat mesangial cells (RMC). However, <el> HG <le>F obviously lifted intracellular 8-nitro-cGMP level, which was accompanied by remarkably suppressed oxidative stress as evidenced by decreased reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde levels and elevated glutathione level. Inhibitor of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) NS-2028 and inhibitor of <re> nitric oxide <er> synthase (NOS) l-NMMA could block increased 8-nitro-cGMP level and repress oxidative stress by <el> HG <le>F. Accordingly, these two inhibitors abrogated <el> HG <le>F-induced nuclear accumulation of NF-E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) and up-regulation of Nrf2 downstream glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) expression. 
Macrophages from mouse strains with the naturally occurring mutation P451L in the purinergic receptor P2X7 have impaired responses to agonists (1). Because P2X7 receptors are expressed in bone cells and are implicated in bone physiology, we asked whether strains with the P451L mutation have a different bone phenotype. By sequencing the most common strains of inbred mice, we found that only a few strains (BALB, NOD, NZW, and 129) were harboring the wild allelic version of the mutation (P451) in the gene for the purinergic receptor P2X7. The strains were compared by means of dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), bone markers, and three-point bending. Cultured osteoclasts were used in the <el> ATP <le>-induced <re> pore formation <er> assay. We found that strains with the P451 allele (BALB/cJ and 129X1/SvJ) had stronger femurs and higher levels of the bone resorption marker C-telopeptide collagen (CTX) compared to C57Bl/6 (B6) and DBA/2J mice. In strains with the 451L allele, pore-formation activity in osteoclasts in vitro was lower after application of <el> ATP <le>. 
Peptide toxins have been valuable probes in efforts to identify amino acid residues that line the permeation pathway of cation-selective channels. However, no peptide toxins have been identified that interact with known anion-selective channels such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (<re> CFTR <er>). <re> CFTR <er> channels are expressed in epithelial cells and are associated with several genetic disorders, including cystic fibrosis and polycystic kidney disease. Several organic inhibitors have been used to investigate the structure of the Cl- permeation pathway in <re> CFTR <er>. However, investigations of the wider cytoplasmic vestibule have been hindered by the lack of a high-affinity blocker that interacts with residues in this area. In this study we show that <el> venom <le> of the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus reversibly inhibits <re> CFTR <er>, in a voltage-independent manner, by decreasing single-channel mean burst duration and open probability only when applied to the cytoplasmic surface of phosphorylated channels. Venom was able to decrease burst duration and open probability even when <re> CFTR <er> channels were locked open by treatment with either vanadate or adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate, and block was strengthened on reduction of extracellular Cl- concentration, suggesting inhibition by a pore-block mechanism. Venom had no effect on ATP-dependent macroscopic opening rate in channels studied by inside-out macropatches. Interestingly, the inhibitory activity was abolished by proteinase treatment. 
The <re> prion <er> agent is the infectious particle causing spongiform encephalopathies in animals and humans and is thought to consist of an altered conformation (PrP(<el> Sc <le>)) of the normal and ubiquitous <re> prion <er> protein PrP(C). The interaction of the <re> prion <er> agent with the immune system, particularly the humoral immune response, has remained unresolved. Here we investigated the immunogenicity of full-length native and infectious <re> prion <er>s, as well as the specific biological effects of the resulting monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) on the binding and clearance of <re> prion <er>s in cell culture and in in vivo therapy. Immunization of <re> prion <er> knockout (Prnp(0/0)) mice with phosphotungstic acid-purified mouse <re> prion <er>s resulted in PrP-specific monoclonal antibodies with binding specificities selective for PrP(<el> Sc <le>) or for both PrP(C) and PrP(<el> Sc <le>). PrP(<el> Sc <le>)-specific MAb W261, of the IgG1 isotype, reacted with <re> prion <er>s from mice, sheep with scrapie, deer with chronic wasting disease (CWD), and humans with sporadic and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in assays including a capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system. This PrP(<el> Sc <le>)-specific antibody was unable to clear <re> prion <er>s from mouse neuroblastoma cells (<el> Sc <le>N2a) permanently infected with scrapie, whereas the high-affinity MAb W226, recognizing both isoforms, PrP(<el> Sc <le>) and PrP(C), did clear <re> prion <er>s from <el> Sc <le>N2a cells, as determined by a bioassay. However, an attempt to treat intraperitoneally <re> prion <er> infected mice with full-length W226 or with a recombinant variable-chain fragment (scFv) from W226 could only slightly delay the incubation time. 
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been proposed to participate in the induction of cardiac preconditioning. However, their source and mechanism of induction are unclear. We tested whether brief <el> hypoxia <le> induces preconditioning by augmenting mitochondrial generation of ROS in chick cardiomyocytes. Cells were preconditioned with 10 min of <el> hypoxia <le>, followed by 1 h of simulated ischemia and 3 h of reperfusion. Preconditioning decreased cell death from 47 +/- 3% to 14 +/- 2%. Return of contraction was observed in 3/3 preconditioned versus 0/6 non-preconditioned experiments. During induction, ROS oxidation of the probe dichlorofluorescin (sensitive to H2O2) increased approximately 2.5-fold. As a substitute for <el> hypoxia <le>, the addition of H2O2 (15 micromol/liter) during normoxia also induced preconditioning-like protection. Conversely, the ROS signal during <el> hypoxia <le> was attenuated with the thiol reductant 2-mercaptopropionyl glycine, the cytosolic Cu,Zn-<re> superoxide <er> dismutase inhibitor diethyldithiocarbamic acid, and the anion channel inhibitor 4,4'-diisothiocyanato-stilbene-2,2'-disulfonate, all of which also abrogated protection. ROS generation during <el> hypoxia <le> was attenuated by myxothiazol, but not by diphenyleneiodonium or the nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor L-nitroarginine. 
Over the past few decades, it has been demonstrated that hyperglycemia can promote lung carcinoma growth, potentially through significantly increased <el> glucose <le> metabolism; however, the underlying mechanism remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, treatment with a high concentration of <el> glucose <le> (HG) significantly promoted the proliferation and migration of A549 cells. Receptor for advanced glycation end‑products (RAGE) has previously been demonstrated to be associated with diabetes mellitus and oxidative stress, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases (NOXs) are considered to be initiating factors of oxidative stress. Therefore, an MTT assay, wound‑healing assay, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting assays were used to analyze the RAGE‑NOX‑4 pathway and to determine its potential involvement in glycometabolism‑associated <re> tumor <er>igenesis. The present study demonstrated that HG could increase the protein expression of RAGE and NOX‑4, whereas the inhibitor of RAGE (anti‑RAGE antibody) could suppress this effect. Futhermore, the inhibitor of NOX [diphenyl iodonium chloride (DPI)] could reduce the protein expression of RAGE and NOX‑4. Furthermore, inhibition of RAGE led to the downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia‑inducible factor‑1α (HIF‑1α), thus suggesting that HG may influence angiogenesis and <re> tumor <er> metabolism via the RAGE‑NOXs pathway. The present study also demonstrated that the RAGE‑blocking antibody downregulated NOX‑4 and subsequently reduced the production of downstream inflammatory factors, whereas DPI did not affect the mRNA expression of RAGE but it did reduce the protein level of RAGE and then attenuate the inflammatory response. These results indicated that inhibition of RAGE or NOXs may promote the reduced expression of VEGF and HIF‑1α, and NOXs may be downstream targets of RAGE, thus indicating a HG‑RAGE‑NOXs‑VEGF/HIF‑1α association. Furthermore, the results indicated that HG may serve a role in the development of lung adenocarcinoma, mediated by the RAGE‑oxidative stress pathway; therefore, the regulation of this <el> glucose <le>‑associated pathway may be a promising novel direction for oncotherapy. However, while certain antidiabetic agents have been verified to exert inhibitory effects on <re> tumor <er> growth, they can also have long‑term adverse effects on the body, which may limit the value of these drugs as anticancer treatments. 
This study was designed to study potentiation of <re> fluoxetine <er>'s antidepressant effect by <el> curcumin <le> or pindolol. Twenty eight groups of mice (n=8) were used in three sets of experiments. In the first set, 9 groups were subjected to the forced swimming test after being treated intraperitoneally with three vehicles, <re> fluoxetine <er> (5 and 20 mg/kg), <el> curcumin <le> (20 mg/kg), pindolol (32 mg/kg), <el> curcumin <le>+<re> fluoxetine <er> (5 mg/kg) and pindolol+<re> fluoxetine <er> (5 mg/kg). One hour after the test, serum and brain <re> fluoxetine <er> and norfluoxetine levels were measured in mice receiving <re> fluoxetine <er> (5 and 20 mg/kg), <el> curcumin <le>+<re> fluoxetine <er> (5 mg/kg) and pindolol+<re> fluoxetine <er> (5 mg/kg). In the second set, the test was done after pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalanine. In the third set, the locomotor activity was measured. The immobility duration was significantly decreased in <re> fluoxetine <er> (20 mg/kg), <el> curcumin <le> (20 mg/kg), <el> curcumin <le>+<re> fluoxetine <er> (5 mg/kg) and pindolol+<re> fluoxetine <er> (5 mg/kg) groups. These decreases were reversed with p-chlorophenylalanine. Fluoxetine and norfluoxetine levels were significantly higher in <re> fluoxetine <er> (20 mg/kg) group with no differences in <re> fluoxetine <er> (5 mg/kg), <el> curcumin <le>+<re> fluoxetine <er> (5 mg/kg) and pindolol+<re> fluoxetine <er> (5 mg/kg) groups. Moreover, drugs failed to alter the locomotor activity indicating absence of central stimulation. 
To examine the role of the macula densa in <re> renin release <er>, afferent arterioles alone or afferent arterioles with the macula densa attached were microdissected from rabbit kidney and incubated in Medium 199 for two consecutive 30-minute periods. Renin concentration in the medium was measured using partially purified rabbit angiotensinogen. Renin release rate over 1 hour from a single arteriole (or an arteriole with macula densa) was calculated and expressed as nanograms of angiotensin I generated per hour per arteriole (or arteriole with macula densa) per hour incubation (ng of ANG I X hr-1 X Af-1/hour). Basal <re> renin release <er> rate from afferent arterioles was 0.69 +/- 0.13 ng of ANG I X hr-1 X Af-1/hour (mean +/- SEM, n = 9) and remained stable for 60 minutes. Basal <re> renin release <er> rate from arterioles with macula densa was 0.25 +/- 0.03 ng of ANG I X hr-1 X Af + MD-1/hour (n = 9), which was significantly lower (p less than 0.025) than that from afferent arterioles alone. When <el> furosemide <le> (1.5 X 10(-3) M) was added to afferent arterioles alone, no significant change in <re> renin release <er> was observed (percent change from control; 24.8 +/- 29.9%; p greater than 0.05, n = 6). When <el> furosemide <le> was added to arterioles with macula densa attached, however, <re> renin release <er> increased by 387 +/- 46% (n = 7; p less than 0.001). After pretreatment with indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, <el> furosemide <le> still increased <re> renin release <er> from 0.17 +/- 0.03 to 0.60 +/- 0.10 ng of ANG I X hr-1 X Af + MD-1/hour (n = 4; p less than 0.05); however, indomethacin pretreatment reduced both the basal <re> renin release <er> rate and the absolute change in <re> renin release <er> induced by <el> furosemide <le>. 
The effects of doxazosin or <el> atenolol <le> on exercise capacity in 15 male distance runners (mean age +/- SD 43 +/- 10 years) were compared in a double-blind, crossover study. Subjects performed a maximal treadmill test and a timed 2-mile run before and after each drug treatment. Cardiac output was determined by acetylene rebreathing at <re> rest <er> and at 30%, 50%, and 75% of maximal oxygen consumption. Oxygen consumption was determined at the above-mentioned workloads and at maximal effort. Both drugs were titrated to produce similar reductions in blood pressure and the final doses of <el> atenolol <le> and doxazosin were 43 +/- 22 and 6 +/- 6 mg, respectively. Atenolol reduced cardiac output (p < 0.05) and heart rate (p < 0.001) at <re> rest <er> and at all exercise intensities compared with the prior placebo phase, whereas doxazosin increased cardiac output at <re> rest <er> and at 50% effort (p < 0.05). Consequently, cardiac output was higher (p < 0.01) with doxazosin than with <el> atenolol <le> at <re> rest <er> and at 30% and 50% effort. Heart rate was higher with doxazosin (p < 0.01) during all exercise workloads. Despite these changes in cardiovascular function, there were no significant differences between the effect of the 2 study drugs on maximal oxygen consumption or 2-mile run times. 
Nitric oxide-mediated activation of large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels is considered an important underlying mechanism of <el> sepsis <le>-induced <re> hypotension <er>. Indeed, the nonselective K-channel inhibitor, tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA), has been proposed as a potential treatment to raise blood pressure in septic shock by virtue of its ability to inhibit BK channels. As experimental evidence has so far relied on pharmacological inhibition, we examined the effects of channel deletion using BKα subunit knockout (α, Slo) mice in two mouse models of polymicrobial <el> sepsis <le>, namely, intraperitoneal fecal slurry and cecal ligation and puncture. Comparison was made against TEA treatment in wild-type (WT) mice. Following slurry, BKα and WT mice developed similar degrees of <re> hypotension <er> over 10 h with no difference in cardiac output as assessed by echocardiography between groups. Tetraethylammonium chloride raised blood pressure significantly in septic WT mice, but had no effect on survival. However, following cecal ligation and puncture, a significantly reduced survival was seen in both BKα mice and (high-dose) TEA-treated WT mice compared with untreated WT animals. 
Increased amounts of monohydroxylated bile salts (<re> BS <er>) have been found in neonatal <el> cholestasis <le>, parenteral nutrition-induced <el> cholestasis <le> and Byler's disease, among others. We analyzed whether the hepatoprotector silymarin (SIL), administered i.p. at the dose of 100mg/kg/day for 5 days, prevents the cholestatic effect induced by a single injection of the model monohydroxylated <re> BS <er> taurolithocholate (TLC, 30 micromol/kg, i.v.) in male Wistar rats. TLC, administered alone, reduced bile flow, total <re> BS <er> output, and biliary output of glutathione and HCO(3)(-) during the peak of <el> cholestasis <le> (-75, -67, -81, and -80%, respectively, P<0.05). SIL prevented partially these alterations, so that the drops of these parameters induced by TLC were of only -41, -25, -60, and -64%, respectively (P<0.05 vs. TLC alone); these differences between control and SIL-treated animals were maintained throughout the whole (120 min) experimental period. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that TLC decreased the intrinsic fractional constant rate for the canalicular transport of both sulfobromophthalein and the radioactive <re> BS <er> [14C]taurocholate by 60 and 68%, respectively (P<0.05), and these decreases were fully and partially prevented by SIL, respectively. SIL increased the hepatic capability to clear out exogenously administered TLC by improving its own biliary excretion (+104%, P<0.01), and by accelerating the formation of its non-cholestatic metabolite, tauromurideoxycholate (+70%, P<0.05). 
Although there is abundant evidence that <el> gastrin-releasing peptide <le> acts as a mitogen in various carcinoma cell lines, the effect of administration of <el> gastrin-releasing peptide <le> on the colorectal mucosa in vivo has not been reported. The aims of this study were to determine whether continuous infusion of <el> gastrin-releasing peptide <le> stimulated <re> proliferation <er> or accelerated carcinogenesis in the rat gastrointestinal tract and other organs. The possible requirement for C-terminal amidation for mitogenic activity in vivo was also investigated. Proliferation was measured in the colon by metaphase index and by immunostaining for the <re> proliferation <er> marker Ki-67, and in other tissues by immunostaining alone. Acceleration of colorectal carcinogenesis was assessed by counting aberrant crypt foci after treatment with the carcinogen azoxymethane. Defunctioning of the rectum reduced both the proliferative index and the crypt height of the rectal mucosa of untreated rats. Treatment with amidated or glycine-extended <el> gastrin-releasing peptide <le> for 4 weeks using implanted mini-osmotic pumps resulted in a two- to three-fold increase in <re> proliferation <er>, and an increase in crypt height, in the defunctioned rectal mucosa (p<0.001), with smaller but significant increases in the caecum and distal colon. No changes in <re> proliferation <er> were detected in lung, pancreas or gastric mucosa. The numbers of aberrant crypt foci in the mid-colon, distal colon and rectum following treatment with azoxymethane were also significantly increased by infusion with amidated or glycine-extended <el> gastrin-releasing peptide <le>. 
Treatment with inhaled beta(2)-agonists immediately before allergen inhalation inhibits allergen-induced early, but not late asthmatic responses (<re> LAR <er>). By contrast, 2 wk treatment with inhaled <el> albuterol <le> increases airway responses to inhaled allergen. We examined the effects of regular <el> albuterol <le> treatment on allergen-induced increases in inflammatory cells in blood and induced sputum. Ten mild, stable allergic asthmatics inhaled <el> albuterol <le> (800 micrograms/day) or placebo for 7 d in a controlled, randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Allergen inhalation was performed 12 h after the final dose. Methacholine airway responsiveness and blood samples were analyzed before and 24 h after, and induced sputum was obtained before, 7 h and 24 h after allergen. Allergen significantly reduced methacholine PC20, increased blood eosinophil numbers, and numbers of sputum neutrophils, EG2 positive and metachromatic cells (p < 0.05), without significant differences between treatments. Albuterol treatment significantly increased the <re> LAR <er> compared to placebo treatment (p = 0.003) and significantly enhanced the number of sputum eosinophils (p = 0.009) and sputum ECP (p = 0.04) at 7 h but not 24 h post-allergen (p > 0.05). 
Acute intoxication and chronic therapy with the alcohol consumption deterrent dithiocarbamate <el> disulfiram <le> have been associated with several neurological complications perhaps involving the impairment of neurotransmitter pathways. In this study we have tested the hypothesis that <re> dopamine <er>rgic malfunction is a critical component in <el> disulfiram <le>-evoked neurotoxicity. Disulfiram antagonized the in vitro striatal binding of [3H]tyramine, a putative marker of the vesicular transporter for <re> dopamine <er>, and the uptake of [3H]<re> dopamine <er> into striatal synaptic vesicles, with inhibitory constants (Ki) in the range of reported blood dithiocarbamate levels in treated alcoholics. Furthermore, <el> disulfiram <le> provoked a loss of radioactivity from [3H]<re> dopamine <er>-preloaded striatal vesicles, when added directly to the incubation mixture. Several metal-containing fungicide analogs were also potent displacers of specifically bound [3H]tyramine. Diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC), the major metabolite of <el> disulfiram <le>, had none of these effects. The intraperitoneal injection of a high dose of <el> disulfiram <le> and DDC into rats, mimicking acute intoxication, induced in vivo overflow of striatal <re> dopamine <er> from both a reserpine-sensitive (vesicular) and an alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine-sensitive (cytoplasmic) pool. The vesicular component of in vivo <re> dopamine <er> release resulted mainly from a direct activity of <el> disulfiram <le>, on the organelles (interaction with the carrier for <re> dopamine <er> plus membrane permeabilization) and indirectly through the mediation of serotonergic 5-HT3 receptors. DDC acted poorly at the vesicle membrane, and the in vivo releasing effect of <re> dopamine <er> was only partially prevented by the inhibition of 5-HT3 receptors, thus suggesting the role of additional mechanisms. 
Flunitrazepam, a hypnotic benzodiazepine, is widely prescribed around the world for the treatment of insomnia and as a preanesthetic. In vitro studies have shown that the <re> metabolism <er> of flunitrazepam to desmethylflunitrazepam and 3-hydroxyflunitrazepam is mediated in part by the polymorphic enzyme <el> CYP2C19 <le>. The objective was to examine the role of <el> CYP2C19 <le> activity in determining flunitrazepam kinetics in vivo. Sixteen healthy volunteers (14 genotypic extensive metabolizers and 2 poor metabolizers) were recruited who had a wide range of <el> CYP2C19 <le> activity (0.50-28.8), as determined by the omeprazole/ 5-hydroxyomeprazole ratio (OMR) at 3 hours following administration of omeprazole, 20 mg orally. Each subject received flunitrazepam, 1 mg orally. Blood samples were collected immediately before and up to 48 hours after drug administration and were assayed by HPLC for flunitrazepam and its metabolites, 7-aminoflunitrazepam, desmethylflunitrazepam, and 3-hydroxyflunitrazepam. Spearman correlations were determined for OMR and pharmacokinetic parameters. With increasing OMR (decreasing <el> CYP2C19 <le> activity), the ratio of flunitrazepam to both desmethylflunitrazepam and 3-hydroxyflunitrazepam AUCs increased ( r = 0.55, p = 0.03 and r = 0.65, p = 0.01, respectively). However, variation in <el> CYP2C19 <le> activity did not significantly affect the AUCs of flunitrazepam or its metabolites. 
The exact mechanism by which anesthetics induce cell membrane-mediated modifications is still an open question. Although the fluidization effect of the anesthetic molecules on the cellular membrane is widely recognized, it is not known if anesthetics show any preference for specific membrane domains, namely the lipid rafts. The importance of these membrane micro-domains derives from the fact that they have been associated with cell signaling pathways, as well as with specific drug interactions. The objective of this work is to contribute for the elucidation of this question through the comparison of the anesthetic interactions with membranes of various lipid compositions. Liposomes prepared with an equimolar mixture of POPC, sphingomyelin and cholesterol, were chosen as models for lipid rafts. The interactions of these liposomes with two local anesthetics, tetracaine and <el> lidocaine <le>, and one general anesthetic, propofol, were studied. The effect of cholesterol was investigated by comparing anesthetic interactions with <re> POPC/SM liposomes <er> and POPC/SM/CHOL liposomes. The following experimental techniques were used: quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, differential scanning calorimetry and phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance. Although the liposomes investigated by the different techniques are not in the same conditions, it is possible to assemble the information obtained from all experimental techniques employed to reach a general conclusion. 
It has been reported that <re> glioma <er> has a higher morbidity and mortality than other types of malignant brain tumor. While <re> glioma <er> has been extensively researched, the exact molecular mechanisms of its genesis and progression have remained to be fully elucidated. In order to explore a novel <re> glioma <er>-associated pathway which may represent a therapeutic target, 61 pairs of tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues of <re> glioma <er> patients were collected and subjected to reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, indicating that the relative expression of microRNA (miR)-128-3p was significantly decreased in the tumor tissues. However, the expression of neuronal pentraxin 1 (NPTX1) was obviously elevated. Through a bioinformatics analysis using Targetscan and transfection experiments, it was confirmed that NPTX1 was targeted by <el> miR-128-3p <le>. In the U251 human <re> glioma <er> cell line, transfection with <el> miR-128-3p <le> mimics increased the levels of phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate 1 (p-IRS-1), phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) and p-AKT, as demonstrated by western blot analysis. In addition, the proliferation rate of the cells was notably decreased following transfection with <el> miR-128-3p <le> mimics. Conversely, transfection with <el> miR-128-3p <le> inhibitor significantly increased the levels of p-IRS-1, PI3K and p-AKT, accompanied by an elevated proliferation rate of the cells. Therefore, it was indicated that <el> miR-128-3p <le> could reversely regulate NPTX1 expression. After the expression of NPTX1 was inhibited with specific small interfering RNA, the levels of p-IRS-1, PI3K and p-AKT were obviously decreased, while the expression of <el> miR-128-3p <le> was not significantly changed. 
Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent endogenous vasoactive peptide whose role in regulation of vascular tone is unclear. <el> BQ123 <le> is a recently described ETA receptor antagonist which may be useful in further investigation of the physiologic and pathophysiologic significance of ET-1. To test its efficacy in the pulmonary circulation, the vascular response to exogenous ET-1 with and without <el> BQ123 <le> was assessed in rat pulmonary artery (PA) rings and salt-perfused lungs. In both main and distal (250-350 microns ID) PA rings, <el> BQ123 <le> significantly attenuated ET-1-induced contractility, but was more effective in the larger vessels. Likewise, <el> BQ123 <le> significantly blunted ET-1-induced <re> vasoconstriction <er> in perfused lungs by > 80%. In addition, it had no effect on ET-3-mediated or U46619-mediated <re> vasoconstriction <er>, nor did it influence ET-1-induced vasodilation. Development of ET-1-associated hydrostatic edema was also unaffected by <el> BQ123 <le>. 
Isometric force development has been measured simultaneously with liberated heat in papillary muscles from the right ventricle of the guinea pig, using rapid antimony-bismuth thermopiles. The following components of the contractile cycle and their relation to energy consumption were evaluated: (1) basal metabolism; (2) crossbridge cycling; (3) <re> calcium <er> cycling; and (4) recovery processes. The influences of <el> isoproterenol <le>, high <re> calcium <er> and UDCG-115, a <re> calcium <er>-sensitizing substance, on these four energy compartments of the muscle were studied relative to their positive inotropic effects. Isoproterenol increased initial heat per peak developed tension or per tension-time integral from 7.4 +/- 1.55 to 11.65 +/- 1.15 mucal/g cm (p less than 0.02) or from 4.52 +/- 0.79 to 8.14 +/- 0.77 mucal/g cm sec (p less than 0.01), respectively. In contrast, these ratios were unchanged from control values by positive inotropic interventions with 11 mM <re> calcium <er> or UDCG-115. The increase of initial heat for a unit of mechanical activity due to <el> isoproterenol <le> is attributable to activation and contractile protein processes, i.e. the activation heat increased from 0.24 +/- 0.05 to 0.68 +/- 0.13 mcal/g (p less than 0.01) and tension-dependent heat per tension-time integral increased from 2.24 +/- 0.60 to 5.18 +/- 0.89 mucal/g cm sec (p less than 0.01). 
Deep vein thrombosis associated with advanced cancer is known as Trousseau's syndrome. We hypothesized that thrombin, an activator of protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1 and PAR-4 contributes to tumor metastasis. In this study, we demonstrated that thrombin and the PAR-1 activating peptide (AP) SFLLRN, but not the PAR-4 AP GYPGKF, induced <el> HIF-1 <le>α activities, protein expression, and <re> cell motility <er> in colorectal cancer cells, and these actions were significantly inhibited by the PAR-1 antagonist SCH79797. Moreover, thrombin-induced <el> HIF-1 <le>α activity and <re> cell motility <er> were blocked by inhibiting important mediators of signaling transduction, including the ERK, PI3K, and mTOR pathways. These results showed that thrombin induced <el> HIF-1 <le>α protein expression through PAR-1 and <el> HIF-1 <le>α translational de novo protein synthesis. Twist can regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increase tumor metastasis. However, we observed that thrombin-induced <el> HIF-1 <le>α increased Twist mRNA and its protein level was mediated by the modulation of PAR-1 activation and the <el> HIF-1 <le>α translational pathway. In addition, Twist could increase N-cadherin but not E-cadherin to promote tumor metastasis. Overexpression of dominant-negative <el> HIF-1 <le>α reversed thrombin-mediated Twist and Twist-induced N-cadherin expression. Moreover, siTwist inhibited Twist-induced N-cadherin and Thrombin-induced <re> cell motility <er>. 
We measured nasal resistance (<re> Rn <er>) while awake, during <el> midazolam <le>-induced sedation and after antagonism with flumazenil (n = 9). Nasal and oral airflow were measured. <re> Rn <er> was calculated by dividing the difference between maximal nasal mask and oropharyngeal pressures by inspiratory airflow at minimum pharyngeal pressure. During sedation, two subjects developed obstructive apnoeic events and four subjects had snoring events. Each apnoea was ended by mechanisms other than a change in breathing route. After antagonism with flumazenil, apnoeic and snoring events were abolished. <re> Rn <er> during <el> midazolam <le> sedation (median 1.46 (25th percentile 1.00, 75th 2.61) kPa litre-1 s) was significantly greater than before <el> midazolam <le> (0.29 (0.25, 0.48) kPa litre-1 s) and after flumazenil (0.41 (0.25, 0.58) kPa litre-1 s) (P < 0.01 in each subject). 
We examined the mechanisms by which nitric oxide (.<el> NO <le>) decreased vectorial <re> Na <er>+ transport across confluent monolayers of rat alveolar type II (ATII) cells grown on permeable supports. Amiloride (10 microM) applied to the apical side of monolayers inhibited approximately 90% of the equivalent (Ieq) and the short-circuit (Isc) current, with an half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.85 microM, indicating that <re> Na <er>+ entry into ATII cells occurred through amiloride-sensitive <re> Na <er>+ channels. .<el> NO <le> generated by spermine <el> NO <le>NOate and papa <el> NO <le>NOate added to both sides of the monolayers decreased Ieq and increased transepithelial resistance in a concentration-dependent fashion (IC50 = 0.4 microM .<el> NO <le>). These changes were prevented or reversed by addition of oxyhemoglobin (50 microM). Incubation of ATII monolayers with 8-bromoguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (400 microM) had no effect on transepithelial <re> Na <er>+ transport. When the basolateral membranes of ATII cells were permeabilized with amphotericin B (10 microM) in the presence of a mucosal-to-serosal <re> Na <er>+ gradient (145:25 mM), .<el> NO <le> (generated by 100 microM papa <el> NO <le>NOate) inhibited approximately 60% of the amiloride-sensitive Isc. In addition, after permeabilization of the apical membranes, .<el> NO <le> inhibited the Isc [a measure of <re> Na <er>(+)-K(+)-adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) activity] by approximately 60%. 
Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is a devastating disease associated with poor survival rate. microRNAs (miRNAs) have recently been reported to assume a great role in CC development. This research aims to explore the functions of <el> miR-874 <le> in regulating epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CC. In obtained CC tissues and cells, miR-784 expression was assessed by RT-qPCR, and <re> CCNE1 <er> expression by RT-qPCR or immunohistochemistry. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was implemented for relationship between miR-784 and <re> CCNE1 <er>. The roles of miR-784, <re> CCNE1 <er> and the NF-κB pathway in CC were investigated on human CC cell lines. <re> CCNE1 <er> was found to be highly expressed in CC while <el> miR-874 <le> expression was lowered in CC tissues and cells, thereby suggesting a negative regulatory effect of <re> CCNE1 <er>. In QBC939 and RBE cells, overexpressing <el> miR-874 <le> or silencing <re> CCNE1 <er> led to augmented IκBα and E-cadherin expression, but diminished <re> CCNE1 <er>, NF-κB, N-cadherin, and Vimentin expression. Moreover, overexpression of <el> miR-874 <le> or <re> CCNE1 <er> silencing led to reduced cell proliferation, invasion, and migration capabilities. 
Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors suppress the metabolism of the potent antihyperglycemic hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). DPP4 was recently shown to provide cardioprotection through a reduction of infarct size, but the mechanism for this remains elusive. Known interactions between DPP4 and adenosine deaminase (ADA) suggest an involvement of adenosine signaling in <el> DPP4 inhibitor <le>-mediated cardioprotection. We tested whether the protective mechanism of the <el> DPP4 inhibitor <le> alogliptin against myocardial <re> ischemia-reperfusion injury <er> involves GLP-1- and/or adenosine-dependent signaling in canine hearts. In anesthetized dogs, the coronary artery was occluded for 90 min followed by reperfusion for 6 h. A 4-day pretreatment with alogliptin reduced the infarct size from 43.1 ± 2.5% to 17.1 ± 5.0% without affecting collateral flow and hemodynamic parameters, indicating a potent antinecrotic effect. Alogliptin also suppressed apoptosis as demonstrated by the following analysis: 1) reduction in the Bax-to-Bcl2 ratio; 2) cytochrome c release, 3) an increase in Bad phosphorylation in the cytosolic fraction; and 4) terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay. This <el> DPP4 inhibitor <le> did not affect blood ADA activity or adenosine concentrations. In contrast, the nonselective adenosine receptor blocker 8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline (8SPT) completely blunted the effect of alogliptin. Alogliptin did not affect Erk1/2 phosphorylation, but it did stimulate phosphorylation of Akt, glycogen synthase kinase-3β, and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Only 8SPT prevented alogliptin-induced CREB phosphorylation. 
Continuous positive airway pressure (<re> CPAP <er>) is widely advocated for the treatment of respiratory complications. However the effects of <re> CPAP <er> on the respiratory function of tetraplegic patients have not yet been investigated. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of breathing with different levels of <re> CPAP <er> on the relationship between closing volume (CV) and functional residual capacity (<el> FRC <le>) in ten recently injured, but otherwise healthy tetraplegic patients with lesions between the fourth and eighth cervical segments. Lung volumes were measured before, during and after 32 min of zero end-expiratory pressure and 5 and 10 cm H2O of <re> CPAP <er>. <el> FRC <le> was measured by the open-circuit nitrogen washout method and CV was measured by the single breath nitrogen washout method. <el> FRC <le> was unaffected by zero end-expiratory pressure, but both 5 cm H2O and 10 cm H2O of <re> CPAP <er> caused significant increases in <el> FRC <le>. <el> FRC <le> returned to pre-<re> CPAP <er> values by the first minute after removal of 5 and 10 cm H2O of <re> CPAP <er>. We were unable to measure CVs in any subjects. 
<el> TMEPAI <le> (transmembrane prostate androgen-induced protein, also called prostate transmembrane protein, androgen-induced 1 (PMEPA1)) is a type I transmembrane (TM) protein, but its cellular function is largely unknown. Here, studying factors influencing the stability of <re> c-Maf <er>, a critical transcription factor in multiple myeloma (MM), we found that <el> TMEPAI <le> induced <re> c-Maf <er> degradation. We observed that <el> TMEPAI <le> recruited NEDD4 (neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 4), a WW domain-containing ubiquitin ligase, to <re> c-Maf <er>, leading to its degradation through the proteasomal pathway. Further investigation revealed that <el> TMEPAI <le> interacts with NEDD4 via its conserved PY motifs. Alanine substitution or deletion of these motifs abrogated the <el> TMEPAI <le> complex formation with NEDD4, resulting in failed <re> c-Maf <er> degradation. Functionally, <el> TMEPAI <le> suppressed the transcriptional activity of <re> c-Maf <er>. Of note, increased <el> TMEPAI <le> expression was positively associated with the overall survival of MM patients. Moreover, <el> TMEPAI <le> was down-regulated in MM cells, and re-expression of <el> TMEPAI <le> induced MM cell apoptosis. 
The effects of two doses of angiotensin II (0.025 micrograms/kg per min and 0.25 micrograms/kg per min) on plasma renin activity (PRA), <re> aldosterone <er> concentration, creatinine clearance, and sodium and potassium excretion were studied in two groups of 2- to 3-week-old <el> lamb <le>s. The 0.025 micrograms/kg per min dose of angiotensin II also was studied in six adult ewes. In response to the angiotensin II infusions, PRA decreased in the newborns from baselines of 24.5 +/- 2.3 ng/ml per hr (mean +/- SE) and 22.9 +/- 3.5 to 13.6 +/- 0.8 and 13.0 +/- 2.2 at 30 minutes (P < 0.01), respectively, and returned to baseline at 60 minutes; PRA decreased from 1.7 +/- 0.1 to 0.95 +/- 0.3 ng/ml per hr at 30 minutes (P < 0.01) in the ewe and returned to baseline at 60 minutes. Plasma <re> aldosterone <er> increased in the newborns from baselines of 17.4 +/- 5.0 ng/dl and 14.7 +/0 3.9 to 33.1 +/- 6.9 and 32.5 +/- 6.3, respectively, at 15 minutes (P < 0.01) and returned to baseline at 60 minutes. Plasma <re> aldosterone <er> increased from 4.3 +/- 0.7 to 9.2 +/- 2.0 ng/dl in the ewe, and returned to baseline at 60 minutes. The change in the PRA and <re> aldosterone <er> responses from baseline to peak for the low and high angiotensin dose was similar in the newborn <el> lamb <le>s and greater than in the ewe (P < 0.01). There was no change in the creatinine clearance, plasma sodium, or hematocrit. Urine sodium excretion increased from 0.16 +/- 0.04 total mEq/30 min to 0.87 +/- 0.27 (P < 0.05) in the newborns during the 0.25 micrograms/kg per min angiotensin II infusion. 
Previous investigations have suggested that protein kinase C (<el> PKC <le>) may regulate guinea pig eosinophil responses through a suppressive "negative feedback" mechanism. Using the selective <el> PKC <le> inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide I (Bis I, GF 109203X) and calphostin C, we examined the role of <el> PKC <le> in platelet-activating factor (<re> PAF <er>)-induced respiratory burst and generation of arachidonic acid metabolites in human peripheral blood eosinophils. Bis I inhibited <re> PAF <er>-induced generation of superoxide anion with substantially lower potency (geometric mean IC50 = 1.41 microM, 95% CI 0.94-2.11 microM) than it exhibited against responses to the phorbol esters 4-beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; IC50 = 0.25 microM, 0.09-0.72 microM; P < 0.01) and 4-beta-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (IC50 = 0.48 microM, 0.20-1.14 microM; P < 0.05). The production of thromboxane (measured as TxB2) induced by 1 microM <re> PAF <er> was increased significantly by Bis I at concentrations of 1 microM (162 +/- 7.5% of control <re> PAF <er> response; P < 0.01) and 10 microM (194 +/- 17%; P < 0.001); TxB2 release induced by PMA was unaffected by concentrations of Bis I up to 1 microM and inhibited by 10 microM Bis I (48 +/- 11%; P < 0.05). Bis I (1 microM) significantly increased both thromboxane and leukotriene C4 (LTC4) production induced by 2 microM (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively) or 20 microM <re> PAF <er> (both P < 0.001). The actions of Bis I on <re> PAF <er>-stimulated thromboxane and leukotriene production were mimicked by a second <el> PKC <le> inhibitor, calphostin C, whereas the non-<el> PKC <le>-inhibitory analog, bisindolylmaleimide V, caused no enhancement of TxB2 or LTC4 production. The increase in intracellular free calcium induced by 1 microM <re> PAF <er> was heightened and prolonged in cells pre-treated with 1 microM Bis I or 1 microM calphostin C (peak increase, P < 0.05 for both drugs; level 60 s after addition of <re> PAF <er>, P < 0.001 and P < 0.05 for Bis I and calphostin C, respectively; time to return to 50% of peak, P < 0.05 for Bis I). 
Resistin and high glucose (HG) are concomitantly present at elevated concentration in diabetic's plasma; both are pro-inflammatory agents acting on vascular cells by mechanisms that are not fully understood. We questioned whether <el> resistin <le> and HG affect the expression of major adhesion molecules, P-selectin and <re> fractalkine <er> in human endothelial cells (HEC). The results showed that in HEC (i) <el> resistin <le> increased P-selectin expression; (ii) HG up-regulated Fk expression; (iii) P-selectin and <re> fractalkine <er> were functional increasing monocyte adhesion to activated cells. Co-stimulation with <el> resistin <le> and HG increased P-selectin and <re> fractalkine <er> mRNA and protein and induced monocyte adhesion, generated an increase in NADPH oxidase activity and of the intracellular reactive oxygen species and activated the NF-kB and AP-1 transcription factors at similar values as those of each activator. 
Neurons of the globus pallidus express <el> dopamine <le> D4 receptors that can modulate transmitter release by their axon terminals. Indeed, <re> GABA release <er> from pallidal terminals in the subthalamic nucleus and in the reticular nucleus of the thalamus is inhibited by activation of D4 receptors. Here we investigated whether <re> GABA release <er> by pallidal projections to the substantia nigra reticulate (SNr) is also modulated by D4 receptors. Dopamine-stimulated depolarization-induced <re> GABA release <er> in slices of the SNr; however, after selective blockade of D1 receptors, <el> dopamine <le> inhibited release. The selective D4 agonist PD 168,077 (IC(50) = 5.30 nM) mimicked the inhibition of release while the selective D4 antagonist L-745,870 blocked the inhibition. To identify the source of D1 and D4 modulated terminals, we unilaterally injected kainic acid in either the GP or the striatum. After lesions of the pallidum, the D4 induced inhibition of release was blocked while the D1 induced stimulation was still significant. Lesions of the striatum had the converse effects. 
Ceramide (Cer) has been implicated in the regulation of <re> apoptosis <er>. In this study, we elevated cellular Cer levels in human colon-carcinoma (HT29(rev)) cells by incubating the cells in the presence of bacterial sphingomyelinase (<el> bSMase <le>) or, alternatively, in the presence of C2-Cer, a short-chain analogue of the sphingolipid. <el> bSMase <le> treatment did not induce <re> apoptosis <er> in these cells, as revealed by a lack of both DNA fragmentation and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase. In contrast, <re> apoptosis <er> did occur upon addition of C2-Cer. These findings led us to study whether differences in the metabolic fate of the excess of Cer, as generated by both treatments, contributed to the observed difference in <re> apoptosis <er>-inducing capacity. C2-Cer was rapidly taken up by HT29(rev) cells and accumulated due to the absence of substantial metabolic conversion. Upon addition of <el> bSMase <le>, hydrolysis of sphingomyelin resulted in a reduction of that pool to 20% compared with control values, accompanied by a multi-fold increase in Cer level. In spite of the continuous presence of active <el> bSMase <le>, the Cer increase turned out to be transient. Cer levels reached their maximum 1-2 h after addition of <el> bSMase <le>, followed by a significant decrease. Excessive Cer was mainly turned over via cerebrosides into complex glycolipids, including gangliosides. In the presence of glucosylceramide synthase- and/or ceramidase inhibitors, this conversion was significantly blocked and <el> bSMase <le>-generated Cer accumulated in the cells. However, even under these conditions <re> apoptosis <er> did not occur. 
To investigate the effects of cytokines on adipocyte <re> lipolysis <er>, a macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) was treated with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (1 microgram/ml) for 18 h to induce cytokine release. Conditioned medium (5%, vol/vol) from these cells was added to rat epididymal adipocytes isolated and incubated under sterile conditions. After incubation, the adipocytes were washed, and the rate of <re> lipolysis <er> (glycerol release) was determined after a further 1-h incubation. The conditioned medium caused an approximately 2.7-fold increase in <re> lipolysis <er>, detectable after 6-12 h, maximal by 24 h, and reversible by 48 h after washing the cells. The effect of conditioned medium was reversed by a neutralizing antibody to mouse tumor necrosis factor-alpha (<el> TNF <le> alpha), and the direct addition of recombinant human <el> TNF <le> alpha (0.1-50 ng/ml) reproduced the effect, with a half-maximally effective concentration of approximately 3 ng/ml. The effect of <el> TNF <le> on the expression of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL; the rate-limiting enzyme for <re> lipolysis <er>) was investigated by Western immunoblots using an antibody raised to a bacterially expressed 96-amino acid portion of the HSL enzyme. <el> TNF <le> treatment did not alter the concentration of immunoreactive HSL. 
Phorbol esters such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (<el> TPA <le>) activate protein kinase C and have been previously shown to down-regulate surfactant proteins SP-A and <re> SP-B <er> in H441 adenocarcinoma cells. We used H441 cells and human fetal lung to further study the mechanism of <el> TPA <le> action and to examine physiologic relevance. In H441 cells, <el> TPA <le> (10 nM) treatment for 24 h decreased SP-A mRNA content to approximately 5% of control cells, with half-maximal effect at approximately 0.5 nM, and reduced SP-A gene transcription rate to 28% of control after 8 h exposure. In cells cultured in the presence of dexamethasone, which increases the low basal level of <re> SP-B <er> expression, <el> TPA <le> decreased both <re> SP-B <er> mRNA content (approximately 8% of control) and rate of transcription (7% of control). In cultured human fetal lung explants, <el> TPA <le> decreased SP-A and <re> SP-B <er> protein and mRNA in a time- and dose-dependent fashion, with half-maximal effect on mRNAs at approximately 3 nM and approximately 50% inhibition after 24 h of exposure, and similarly reduced SP-A and <re> SP-B <er> gene transcription (approximately 55% of control at 8-24 h). 
Previous in vivo studies have shown that in male rabbits <el> prolactin <le> inhibits the testosterone production stimulated by luteinizing hormone (<re> LH <er>) or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This inhibition has now been studied in vitro using both mouse and rat testicular interstitial cells. First, the dose response of human <re> LH <er> (hLH) stimulation of testosterone was studied in detail using testicular interstitial cells from both species. Next, a small but stimulatory dose of hLH was selected and extensive <el> prolactin <le> doses were studied in vitro. NIH B-6 (bovine) <el> prolactin <le> in varying doses was added to the interstitial cells 30 min prior to the addition of a constant dose of hLH. Under these circumstances <el> prolactin <le> inhibited <re> LH <er> action over a wide range of doses. In both species a biphasic dose-response curve existed: large doses of 100 to 1000 ng/ml produced less inhibition or augmented <re> LH <er> action, compared to smaller doses. Next, entire hLH dose-response curves were produced in the presence of three doses of <el> prolactin <le> (0.33, 33, and 1000 ng/ml) as well as in the absence of <el> prolactin <le>. The addition of <el> prolactin <le> shifted the hLH dose-response curve to the right and depressed the maximal response in comparison to the curve without <el> prolactin <le>. Finally, inhibitory doses of <el> prolactin <le> resulted in no detectable change in <re> LH <er> receptor number as estimated from Scatchard plots. 
In addition to its vasodilator properties, nitric oxide (NO) promotes angiogenesis in the systemic circulation and tumors. However, the role of NO in promoting normal lung vascular growth and its impact on <re> alveolarization <er> during development or in response to perinatal stress is unknown. We hypothesized that NO modulates lung vascular and alveolar growth and that decreased NO production impairs distal lung growth in response to mild <el> hypoxia <le>. Litters of 1-day-old mouse pups from parents that were heterozygous for endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) deficiency were placed in a hypobaric chamber at a simulated altitude of 12,300 ft (Fi(O(2)) = 0.16). After 10 days, the mice were killed, and lungs were fixed for morphometric and molecular analysis. Compared with wild-type controls, mean linear intercept (MLI), which is inversely proportional to alveolar surface area, was increased in the eNOS-deficient (eNOS -/-) mice [51 +/- 2 micro m (eNOS -/-) vs. 41 +/- 1 micro m (wild type); P < 0.01]. MLI was also increased in the eNOS heterozygote (+/-) mice (44 +/- 1 micro m; P < 0.03 vs. wild type). Vascular volume density was decreased in the eNOS -/- mice compared with wild-type controls (P < 0.03). Lung vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein and VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) protein content were not different between the study groups. In contrast, lung VEGFR-2 protein content was decreased from control values by 63 and 34% in the eNOS -/- and eNOS +/- mice, respectively (P < 0.03). 
We evaluated in patients suffering from COPD-related pulmonary hypertension whether <el> nifedipine <le> therapy lowers acutely and chronically pulmonary vascular pressure and resistance and whether pulmonary transmural pressure may be further lowered by the combined use of <el> nifedipine <le> and <re> oxygen <er>. Changes of the pulmonary vascular tone were determined on the pulmonary driving pressure/flow curve, which was generated by upright exercise. Fifteen patients with COPD and mean pulmonary pressure greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg were studied at control (Week 0) and after 1 wk of <el> nifedipine <le> treatment (180 mg daily, Week 1). It was possible to pursue the same <el> nifedipine <le> daily dosage for 2 months in 10 patients, who were re-evaluated after 8 wk of treatment and after <el> nifedipine <le> withdrawal the following week. At Week 1, mean pulmonary transmural pressure was reduced (32.8 +/- 4.1 versus 27.3 +/- 2.8 mm Hg, mean +/- SE, p less than 0.05) via active pulmonary vasodilation because the pulmonary driving pressure/flow curve was shifted right and downward. Both mean transmural pulmonary pressure lowering effect and active pulmonary vasodilatation regressed during long-term <el> nifedipine <le> treatment. Oxygen reduced pulmonary transmural pressure (32.8 +/- 4.1 versus 28.6 +/- 2.9 mm Hg, p less than 0.05, Week 0); however, this effect always disappeared during <el> nifedipine <le> treatment. 
We previously described the isolation of Tax 18 and Tax 11-6, two <el> paclitaxel <le>-dependent cell lines that assemble low amounts of microtubule polymer and require the drug for <re> cell division <er>. In the present studies, fluorescence time-lapse microscopy was used to measure microtubule dynamic instability behavior in these cells. The mutations were found to cause small decreases in microtubule growth and shortening, but the changes seemed unable to explain the defects in microtubule polymer levels or <re> cell division <er>. Moreover, <el> paclitaxel <le> further suppressed microtubule dynamics at low drug concentrations that were insufficient to rescue the mutant phenotype. Wild-type (WT) cells treated with similar low drug concentrations also had highly suppressed microtubules, yet experienced no problems with <re> cell division <er>. Thus, the effects of <el> paclitaxel <le> on microtubule dynamics seemed to be unrelated to <re> cell division <er> in both WT and mutant cell lines. The higher drug concentrations needed to rescue the mutant phenotype instead inhibited the formation of unstable microtubule fragments that appeared at high frequency in the drug-dependent, but not WT, cell lines. Live cell imaging revealed that the fragments were generated by microtubule detachment from centrosomes, a process that was reversed by <el> paclitaxel <le>. 
<el> KCNQ1 <le> is responsible for the pore-forming subunit of channels that mediate the cardiac 'IKs' potassium channel current. The S140G <el> KCNQ1 <le> gain-of-function mutation is responsible for a form of heritable atrial fibrillation. Here the action potential (<re> AP <er>) voltage clamp technique was used to elucidate the effect of S140G <el> KCNQ1 <le> on the profile of recombinant I(Ks) during atrial and ventricular <re> AP <er>s applied to <el> KCNQ1 <le>+KCNE1 expressing CHO cells, at 37°C. Under conventional voltage clamp the S140G <el> KCNQ1 <le> mutation shifted voltage-dependent activation by ≈-62 mV, with a marked instantaneous current component evident on membrane depolarisation. Under atrial <re> AP <er> clamp, cells expressing wild-type (WT) <el> KCNQ1 <le> exhibited modest outward currents during atrial repolarisation, whilst those expressing S140G <el> KCNQ1 <le> exhibited a marked instantaneous outward current and peak repolarising current >4-fold that for WT <el> KCNQ1 <le>. Under ventricular <re> AP <er> clamp, both WT and mutant <el> KCNQ1 <le> conditions showed greater peak repolarising current than when an atrial <re> AP <er> command was used and the S140G mutation resulted in peak repolarising current that was >3-fold that for WT <el> KCNQ1 <le>. 
The pituitary lactotroph, a well established target for <el> estrogen <le>s, expresses <el> estrogen <le> receptor-alpha (ER alpha) and -beta (ER beta). A truncated isoform of ER alpha, named TERP, is expressed in the pituitary, but not in the uterus. In this study we used the somatolactotroph cell line, GH3 cells, to examine 1) the expression of ER alpha, TERP, or ER beta and their regulation by estradiol; 2) the presence of receptor proteins; and 3) the effects of overexpressing ER beta or TERP on <el> estrogen <le> induction of the PRL gene and activation of the <el> estrogen <le> response element (ERE). Incubation of GH3 cells with estradiol (0.1-10 nM) produced dose-dependent increases in messenger RNA levels of ER beta and TERP, but not ER alpha, as determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Cell incubation with 1 nM estradiol resulted in a time-dependent biphasic increase in TERP and a delayed rise in ER beta, suggesting activation by both direct and indirect mechanisms. A polyclonal ER beta antibody directed against an N-terminal synthetic peptide was generated. This antibody detected ER beta-positive cells in ovarian granulosa cells and in many cells throughout the pituitary; its specificity was demonstrated by preabsorption with the synthetic peptide. The antibody detected a 58- to 60-kDa protein by Western blotting of ovarian, pituitary, and GH3 cell extracts. Cotransfection of ER beta and reporter genes (PRL promoter/luciferase or ERE/luciferase) into GH3 cells resulted in a dose-dependent increase in <el> estrogen <le>-induced <re> PRL gene expression <er>, with a lesser activation of the ERE. A 20-kDa TERP protein was undetectable in untreated GH3 cells and was weakly induced by estradiol. Overexpression of TERP had no effect on <el> estrogen <le> induction of either PRL or ERE. 
We sought to define the effects of maturation and hyperoxic stress on nitric oxide (<el> NO <le>)-induced modulation of bronchopulmonary responses to stimulation of vagal preganglionic nerve fibers. Experiments were performed on decerebrate, paralyzed, and ventilated rat pups at 6-7 days (n = 21) and 13-15 days of age (n = 23) breathing room air and on rat pups 13-15 days of age (n = 19) after exposure to hyperoxia (>/=95% inspired O(2) fraction for 4-6 days). Total lung resistance (RL) and lung elastance (EL) were measured by body plethysmograph. Vagal stimulation and release of <re> acetylcholine <er> caused a frequency-dependent increase in RL and EL in all animals. The RL response was significantly potentiated in normoxic animals by prior blockade of nitric oxide synthase (<el> NO <le>S) (P < 0.05). Hyperoxic exposure increased responses of RL to vagal stimulation (P < 0.05); however, after hyperoxic exposure, the potentiation of contractile responses by <el> NO <le>S blockade was abolished. The response of EL was potentiated by <el> NO <le>S blockade in the 13- to 15-day-old animals after both normoxic and hyperoxic exposure (P < 0.01). Morphometry revealed no effect of hyperoxic exposure on airway smooth muscle thickness. 
The pro-apoptotic signalling cascades induced by tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) have been intensively studied in multiple cellular systems. So far, it is known that TNF-α can simultaneously activate survival and apoptotic cell <re> death <er> responses. The balance between these signals determines the ultimate response of the cell to TNF-α. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that melatonin may be involved in the protection of different cell types against apoptosis. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of melatonin on TNF-α-induced apoptosis in human leucocytes. Cells were treated with TNF-α alone or in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX), which promotes caspase-8 activation by eliminating the endogenous caspase-8 inhibitor, c-FLIP. Treatment with TNF-α/CHX led to apoptotic cell <re> death <er>, as ascertained by annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining. Likewise, in the presence of CHX, TNF-α stimulation produced <el> cFLIP <le> down-regulation and subsequent caspase-8 activation, thus directly triggering caspase-3 activation and causing Bid truncation and subsequent caspase-9 activation. Conversely, pre-incubation of cells with melatonin inhibited TNF-α-/CHX-evoked leucocyte apoptosis. Similarly, pretreatment of leucocytes with melatonin increased <el> cFLIP <le> protein levels, thereby preventing TNF-α-/CHX-mediated caspase processing. Blockade of melatonin membrane receptor MT1/MT2 or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway with luzindole or PD98059, respectively, abolished the inhibitory effects of melatonin on leucocyte apoptosis evoked by TNF-α/CHX. 
The aim of the present study was to investigate the putative role of endothelin (ET) in mediating <el> ischemia <le>/hypoxia-induced <re> ANP release <er> utilizing exogenous ET-1 or ET receptor antagonists (BQ-123 or Bosentan). Isolated rat hearts with non-distended atria were perfused using a Langendorff apparatus and heart rate maintained constant via atrial pacing. Global <el> ischemia <le> was induced either by direct reduction in perfusion or by infusion of exogenous ET-1 (5 x 10(-10) M) for 30 minutes. Perfusion with the ET receptor antagonists, BQ-123 (10(-6) M) or Bosentan (10(-5) M) was initiated 10 minutes before onset of <el> ischemia <le>. Moderate or severe <el> ischemia <le> was induced by reduction (52-61% and 70-82%, respectively) in perfusate flow. Thirty minutes of <el> ischemia <le>/hypoxia (5% O2) was followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion/re-oxygenation. Both moderate and severe <el> ischemia <le> increased <re> ANP release <er>. BQ-123 and Bosentan did not affect basal or <el> ischemia <le>-induced <re> ANP release <er>. Exogenous ET-1 perfusion induced a late increase in <re> ANP release <er> (P < 0.01) that did not exceed the increase in <re> ANP release <er> associated with equivalent direct flow reduction. Hypoxia induced an 8-fold increase in <re> ANP release <er> rate. The <re> ANP release <er> rate returned toward basal levels after re-oxygenation. Bosentan, but not BQ-123, significantly attenuated (P < 0.01) hypoxia-induced <re> ANP release <er>. 
Periprosthetic osteolysis belongs to osteolytic diseases, which often occur due to an imbalance between osteoclast and osteoblast number or activity. <el> Fraxetin <le>, a natural plant extract, inhibits osteoblast apoptosis and has therapeutic potential for treating osteolytic diseases. However, data pertaining to the effects of fraxetin on osteoclasts are limited. In the present study, it was demonstrated that the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis by fraxetin had an important role on the therapy of titanium particle‑induced osteolysis in vivo. In addition, fraxetin was demonstrated to suppress receptor activator of nuclear factor‑κB ligand (RANKL)‑mediated <re> osteoclast differentiation <er> and bone resorption in vitro in a dose‑dependent manner. 
Excessive nutrition promotes the <re> pathogenesis <er> of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), characterized by the accumulation of pro-inflammation mediators in the liver. In the present study we investigated the regulation of pro-inflammatory transcription in hepatocytes by protein inhibitor of activated STAT 4 (PIAS4) in this process and the underlying mechanisms. We report that expression of the class III deacetylase <el> SIRT1 <le> was down-regulated in the livers of NASH mice accompanied by a simultaneous increase in the expression and binding activity of PIAS4. Exposure to high glucose stimulated the expression PIAS4 in cultured hepatocytes paralleling <el> SIRT1 <le> repression. Estrogen, a known NASH-protective hormone, ameliorated <el> SIRT1 <le> trans-repression by targeting PIAS4. Over-expression of PIAS4 enhanced, while PIAS4 knockdown alleviated, repression of <el> SIRT1 <le> transcription by high glucose. Lentiviral delivery of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting PIAS4 attenuated hepatic inflammation in NASH mice by restoring <el> SIRT1 <le> expression. Mechanistically, PIAS4 promoted NF-κB-mediated pro-inflammatory transcription in a <el> SIRT1 <le> dependent manner. 
The results of the Guardian/Expedition trials demonstrate the need for more precisely controlled studies to inhibit Na/H exchange (<el> NHE1 <le>) during <re> ischemia <er>/reperfusion. This is because overwhelming evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that myocardial ischemic injury results in part from increases in intracellular Na (Nai) mediated by <el> NHE1 <le> that in turn promote Na/Ca exchanger-mediated increases in intracellular Ca ([Ca]i) and Ca-dependent cell damage. We used a more potent and specific <el> NHE1 <le> inhibitor HOE 694 (HOE) to test whether inhibition of <el> NHE1 <le> during <re> ischemia <er> limits increases in Nai and [Ca]i in newborns. NMR was used to measure pHi, Nai, [Ca]i, and ATP in isolated newborn rabbit hearts. Perfusion pressure, left ventricular developed pressure, and creatine kinase were measured. HOE was added before global <re> ischemia <er>. Results are reported as mean +/- SE. Nai (mEq/kg dry weight) rose from 11.6 +/- 0.9 before <re> ischemia <er> to 114.0 +/- 16.1 at the end of <re> ischemia <er> and recovered to 55.2 +/- 11.8 in the control group. During <re> ischemia <er> and reperfusion, the corresponding values for Nai in the HOE group (63.1 +/- 8.4 and 15.9 +/- 2.5, respectively, P < 0.05) were lower than control. In the control group [Ca]i (nM/L) rose from 331 +/- 41 to 1069 +/- 71 and recovered to 814 +/- 51, whereas in the HOE group [Ca]i rose less (P < 0.05): 359 +/- 50, 607 +/- 85, and 413 +/- 40, respectively. Total creatine kinase release was significantly reduced in the HOE group. Perfusion pressure and left ventricular developed pressure also recovered significantly better in the HOE group than in the control. 
The aim of our study was to evaluate whether <el> captopril <le> administered at night, can shift the circadian blood pressure (<re> BP <er>) from a nondipper to a dipper pattern in adequately controlled hypertensive patients, who continued their antihypertensive therapy. In a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled designed study, we enrolled 121 treated, adequately controlled nondipping hypertensive patients. All patients were randomly assigned to 12.5 mg <el> captopril <le> or placebo treatment administered at night. In case of nondippers, the dosage of <el> captopril <le> or placebo was doubled after two weeks of treatment, while for dippers antihypertensive regimens were not changed. After another two weeks, all patients underwent ambulatory <re> BP <er> monitoring. Our results show that at the end of the active treatment period, the prevalence of a dipping diurnal <re> BP <er> pattern in the <el> captopril <le> group (70%) was significantly higher than that in the placebo group (9.8%, P < 0.001). Nighttime <re> BP <er>, night/day <re> BP <er> ratio, nighttime <re> BP <er> load and 24-h systolic <re> BP <er> were significantly lower after 4 weeks nighttime <el> captopril <le> treatment compared to baseline. 
Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (<el> G-CSF <le>) is commonly used in clinical practice to accelerate neutropenia recovery after chemotherapy. <el> G-CSF <le> is a myeloid growth factor produced by monocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Generally, aortitis and <re> arteritis <er> are not a known side effect of <el> G-CSF <le> and is thought to be extremely rare. Here, we present a case of a 77-year-old woman who underwent adjuvant chemotherapy (combined paclitaxel and carboplatin) for ovarian cancer, and then developed acute <re> arteritis <er> after receiving <el> G-CSF <le>. She developed grade 4 neutropenia on day 7 of the third chemotherapy cycle and received six <el> G-CSF <le> administrations. Two days after <el> G-CSF <le> administration, she came down with a high-grade fever that persisted for 2 weeks. Laboratory tests revealed a white blood cell count of 8700 UI, neutrophilic sequestration of 61.5%, and C-reactive protein of 8.43 mg/dl at the highest point of her fever. Considering that we were initially treating neutropenia, we diagnosed a bacterial infection, and she was treated with a course of antibiotics. However, her blood and urinalysis cultures were negative, and antibiotics were ineffective; thus, we performed a computed tomography scan to search for the cause of her persistent fever. The computed tomography scan showed remarkable thickness of the bilateral common carotid artery and the left subclavian artery consistent with <re> arteritis <er>. With cessation of the antibiotics course, she was followed closely without therapy, and her condition resolved in a few days. 
<el> cCMP <le> is a cyclic pyrimidine nucleotide which binds to and activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). In S49 lymphoma cells, cAMP induces <re> apoptosis <er> via PKA. In our present study, we examined the effect of <el> cCMP <le> on <re> apoptosis <er> in S49 mouse lymphoma cells and in PKA-deficient S49kin(-)cells. These two cell lines also lack PKG, hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels 2 and 4 (HCN2 and HCN4) as assessed by real-time PCR. The cell-permeable analog <el> cCMP <le>-AM induced PKA- and PKG-independent <re> apoptosis <er> in S49 cells. In contrast, exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac) activation did not induce <re> apoptosis <er>. <el> cCMP <le> induced caspase-dependent <re> apoptosis <er> via the intrinsic pathway, led to cytochrome c release from mitochondria and also activated the ER stress pathway. On the contrary, the extrinsic apoptotic pathway was not involved. Autophagy was not detectable after treatment with <el> cCMP <le>-AM in both cell lines. cAMP-AM, cGMP-AM, cUMP-AM as well as the cyclic nucleotides lacking the acetoxymethylester (AM)-group had no effect. <el> cCMP <le>-AM altered gene expression of the apoptotic-relevant gene Gadd45α and the immediate early response genes cFos and Nr4A1 in S49 wild-type (wt) cells. 
Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is the master regulator of metabolic adaptation to hypoxia. It is appreciated that HIF-1alpha accumulation is achieved under normoxic conditions by e.g., nitric oxide. We determined molecular mechanisms of HIF-1alpha accumulation under the impact of S-nitrosoglutathione (<el> GSNO <le>). In human embryonic kidney cells <el> GSNO <le> provoked nuclear accumulation of HIF-1alpha. This appeared unrelated to gene transcription and protein translation, thus pointing to inhibition of HIF-1alpha degradation. Indeed, <el> GSNO <le> as well as the hypoxia mimic CoCl2 decreased ubiquitination of HIF-1alpha and <el> GSNO <le>-induced HIF-1alpha failed to coimmunoprecipitate with pVHL (von Hippel Lindau protein). Considering that HIF-1alpha-pVHL interactions require prolyl hydroxylation of HIF-1alpha, we went on to demonstrate inhibition of HIF-1alpha <re> prolyl hydroxylase <er>s (PHDs) by <el> GSNO <le>. In vitro HIF-1alpha-pVHL interactions revealed that <el> GSNO <le> dose-dependently inhibits PHD activity but not the interaction of a synthetic peptide resembling the hydroxylated oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIF-1alpha with pVHL. 
L-Arginine (L-Arg) affects various parameters that modulate the progression of renal disease. These same factors [e.g., glomerular filtration rate, changes in mesangial cell (<re> MC <er>) tension, and production of NO] are all controlled at least in part by changes in <re> MC <er> intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). We therefore evaluated the effect of L-Arg on <re> MC <er> [Ca2+]i. We found that L-Arg inhibits the <el> vasopressin <le>-stimulated rise in <re> MC <er> [Ca2+]i both in rat and murine cell cultures. This effect does not appear to be due to metabolism of L-Arg to either NO or L-ornithine (L-Orn). Blocking the metabolism of L-Arg with Nomega-monomethyl-L-arginine, an NO synthase inhibitor, or with 20 mM L-valine (L-Val), an inhibitor of Orn formation, does not reverse the inhibition. However, other cationic amino acids, as well guanidine, the functional group of L-Arg, all inhibit the <el> vasopressin <le>-stimulated rise in [Ca2+]i, consistent with a structural basis for this effect. 
We considered the role of thyroid hormones in the growth of the coronary microvasculature during various levels of afterload. Arterial pressure was increased for 3 mo in hypothyroid and euthyroid rabbits via the Page (1-kidney, 1-wrap) method. Systolic pressures (mmHg +/- SE) indicated that the groups could be characterized as follows: euthyroid sham normotensive (103 +/- 5), euthyroid Page hypertensive (158 +/- 24), hypothyroid Page normotensive (110 +/- 5), and hypothyroid sham hypotensive (87 +/- 5). The hypothyroid groups were characterized by bradycardia. Left ventricular weight-to-body weight ratios were higher in the Page groups than in the controls. Minimal coronary vascular resistance (<el> MCVR <le>) was elevated in the euthyroid Page group but was not affected by <re> hypothyroidism <er>. Lumen diameters of the major resistance vessels tended to be larger in the hypertensive rabbits. Capillary length density was greater in the hypothyroid than in the euthyroid groups. 
Spores of Bacillus subtilis lacking all <re> germinant receptors <er> germinate >500-fold slower than wild-type spores in nutrients and were not induced to germinate by a pressure of 100 <el> MPa <le>. However, a pressure of 550 <el> MPa <le> induced germination of spores lacking all <re> germinant receptors <er> as well as of receptorless spores lacking either of the two lytic enzymes essential for cortex hydrolysis during germination. Complete germination of spores either lacking both cortex-lytic enzymes or with a cortex not attacked by these enzymes was not induced by a pressure of 550 <el> MPa <le>, but treatment of these mutant spores with this pressure caused the release of dipicolinic acid. 
We studied the in vivo total <re> bilirubin <er> production, as indexed by the carboxyhemoglobin level (HbCO), of infants whose mothers had ritodrine (RIT) tocolysis or underwent tocolysis with the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine (<el> NIF <le>). No difference in HbCO between the infant groups was detected: <el> NIF <le> 0.67 +/- 0.31% saturation and RIT 0.88 +/- 0.47% saturation. 
Hesperidin (HDN) is a flavanone glycoside abundantly found in citrus fruits. HDN has been reported to possess significant activities against allergy, haemorrhoids, hormonal disorders and ulcers. Other reported activities include anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant and free radical scavenger activity. A potentially important effect of endotoxin is the increased production of reactive <re> oxygen <er> intermediates as O(2)(-), peroxides and nitric oxide. The study reported here show a beneficial effect of HDN in amelioration of endotoxin-induced hepatic dysfunction and oxidative stress in the liver of rats. Hepatotoxicity was induced by administering lipopolysaccharide (<el> LPS <le>), in a single dose of 1mg/kg intraperitoneally to the rats. A marked hepatic dysfunction evident by rise in serum levels of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP) and total bilirubin (p<0.05) was observed. Serum and tissue nitrite levels were also increased. <el> LPS <le> challenge further increased thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels, whereas glutathione (GSH) content and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were decreased in the liver homogenates of the rats showing a marked oxidative stress. HDN administration successfully and dose dependently attenuated these effects of <el> LPS <le>. 
A randomized, double-masked, crossover clinical trial was carried out to evaluate whether lovastatin therapy (60 mg daily) affects the initiation of oxidation of low density lipoprotein (<re> LDL <er>) in cardiac patients on <el> alpha-tocopherol <le> supplementation therapy (450 IU daily). Twenty-eight men with verified coronary heart disease and hypercholesterolemia received <el> alpha-tocopherol <le> with lovastatin or with dummy tablets in random order. The two 6-week, active-treatment periods were preceded by a washout period of at least 8 weeks. The oxidizability of <re> LDL <er> was determined by 2 methods ex vivo. The depletion times for <re> LDL <er> ubiquinol and <re> LDL <er> <el> alpha-tocopherol <le> were determined in timed samples taken during oxidation induced by 2, 2-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile). Copper-mediated oxidation of <re> LDL <er> isolated by rapid density-gradient ultracentrifugation was used to measure the lag time to the propagation phase of conjugated-diene formation. alpha-Tocopherol supplementation led to a 1.9-fold concentration of reduced <el> alpha-tocopherol <le> in <re> LDL <er> (P<0.0001) and to a 2.0-fold longer depletion time (P<0.0001) of <el> alpha-tocopherol <le> compared with determinations after the washout period. A 43% prolongation (P<0.0001) was seen in the lag time of conjugated-diene formation. Lovastatin decreased the depletion time of reduced <el> alpha-tocopherol <le> in metal ion-independent oxidation by 44% and shortened the lag time of conjugated-diene formation in metal ion-dependent oxidation by 7%. 
In 1997, an IARC Working Group classified <el> quartz <le> (crystalline silica) as a Group 1 lung carcinogen, but only in some industries, i.e., the <el> quartz <le> hazard is a variable entity. The reactivity of the <el> quartz <le> surface may underlie its ability to cause <re> inflammation <er>, and treatments that ameliorate this reactivity will reduce the <el> quartz <le> hazard. In this study we treated <el> quartz <le> (Q) with aluminium lactate (AL), a procedure that is reported to decrease the <el> quartz <le> hazard, and explored the effect this had on the highly reactive <el> quartz <le> surface and on proinflammatory events in rat lungs. Aluminium lactate-treated <el> quartz <le> showed a reduced surface reactivity as measured by electron spin resonance and the hemolysis assay. Eighteen hours after instillation of Q into the rat lung, there was massive <re> inflammation <er> as indicated by the number of neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). In addition, Q induced an increase in BAL macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) while ALQ had no significant effect compared to control. Epithelial damage, as indicated by BAL protein and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, also increased with Q but not with ALQ. Furthermore, Q induced an increase in MIP-2 mRNA by BAL cells while ALQ had no effect compared to controls. There was an increase in nuclear binding of the transcription nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) in the Q-exposed BAL cells and again no effect on nuclear NF-kappaB binding in BAL cells from ALQ-exposed rats. 
Insulin resistance is frequently associated with increased lipid content in muscle and liver. Insulin excess stimulates tissue lipid accumulation. To examine the effects of <el> insulin <le> and improved glycemia on <el> insulin <le> sensitivity and intracellular lipids, we performed stepped (1, 2, and 4 mU x min(-1) x kg(-1)) hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps in eight type 2 diabetic and six nondiabetic control subjects at baseline and after 12 and 67 h of <el> insulin <le>-mediated near-normoglycemia (118 +/- 7 mg/dl). Intrahepatocellular lipids (IHCLs) and intramyocellular lipids (IMCLs) of soleus (IMCL-S) and tibialis anterior muscle (IMCL-TA) were measured with (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. At baseline, nondiabetic subjects had an approximate twofold higher <el> insulin <le> sensitivity (P < 0.02) and lower IHCLs than diabetic patients (5.8 +/- 1.2 vs. 18.3 +/- 4.2%, P < 0.03), in whom IMCL-TA negatively correlated with <el> insulin <le> sensitivity (r = -0.969, P < 0.001). After a 67-h <el> insulin <le> infusion in diabetic patients, IMCL-S and IHCLs were increased (P < 0.05) by approximately 36 and approximately 18%, respectively, and correlated positively with <el> insulin <le> sensitivity (IMCL-S: r = 0.982, P < 0.0005; IHCL: r = 0.865, P < 0.03), whereas fasting <re> glucose <er> production, measured with D-[6,6-(2)H(2)]<re> glucose <er>, decreased by approximately 10% (P < 0.04). 
The aim of the study was to perform the Monte Carlo (<el> MC <le>) evaluation of RapidArc (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) dose calculations for four oropharynx midline sparing planning strategies. Six patients with squamous cell cancer of the oropharynx were each planned with four RapidArc head and neck treatment strategies consisting of single and double photon arcs. In each case, RTOG0522 protocol objectives were used during planning optimization. Dose calculations performed with the analytical anisotropic algorithm (<re> AAA <er>) are compared against BEAMnrc/DOSXYZnrc dose calculations for the 24-plan dataset. Mean dose and dose-to-98%-of-structure-volume (D(98%)) were used as metrics in the evaluation of dose to planning target volumes (PTVs). Mean dose and dose-to-2%-of-structure-volume (D(2%)) were used to evaluate dose differences within organs at risk (OAR). Differences in the conformity index (CI) and the homogeneity index (HI) as well as 3D dose distributions were also observed. <re> AAA <er> calculated PTV mean dose, D(98%), and HIs showed very good agreement with <el> MC <le> dose calculations within the 0.8% <el> MC <le> (statistical) calculation uncertainty. Regional node volume (PTV-80%) mean dose and D(98%) were found to be overestimated (1.3%, sigma = 0.8% and 2.3%, sigma = 0.8%, respectively) by the <re> AAA <er> with respect to <el> MC <le> calculations. Mean dose and D(2%) to OAR were also observed to be consistently overestimated by the <re> AAA <er>. Increasing dose calculation differences were found in planning strategies exhibiting a higher overall fluence modulation. From the plan dataset, the largest local dose differences were observed in heavily shielded regions and within the esophageal and sinus cavities. <re> AAA <er> dose calculations as implemented in RapidArc demonstrate excellent agreement with <el> MC <le> calculations in unshielded regions containing moderate inhomogeneities. Acceptable agreement is achieved in regions of increased MLC shielding. Differences in dose are attributed to inaccuracies in the <re> AAA <er>-modulated fluence modeling, modeling of material inhomogeneities and dose deposition within low-density materials. 
Disulfide forms of <re> homocysteine <er> account for >98% of total <re> homocysteine <er> in plasma from healthy individuals. We recently reported that <re> homocysteine <er> reacts with albumin-Cys(34)-S-S-cysteine to form <re> homocysteine <er>-cysteine mixed disulfide and albumin-Cys(34) <el> thiol <le>ate anion. The latter then reacts with homocystine or <re> homocysteine <er>-cysteine mixed disulfide to form albumin-bound <re> homocysteine <er> (Sengupta, S., Chen, H., Togawa, T., DiBello, P. M., Majors, A. K., Büdy, B., Ketterer, M. E., and Jacobsen, D. W. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 30111-30117). We now extend these studies to show that human albumin, but not ceruloplasmin, mediates the conversion of <re> homocysteine <er> to its low molecular weight disulfide forms (homocystine and <re> homocysteine <er>-cysteine mixed disulfide) by <el> thiol <le>/disulfide exchange reactions. Only a small fraction of homocystine is formed by an oxidative process in which copper bound to albumin, but not ceruloplasmin, mediates the reaction. When copper is removed from albumin by chelation, the overall conversion of <re> homocysteine <er> to its disulfide forms is reduced by only 20%. Ceruloplasmin was an ineffective catalyst of <re> homocysteine <er> oxidation, and immunoprecipitation of ceruloplasmin from human plasma did not inhibit the capacity of plasma to mediate the conversion of <re> homocysteine <er> to its disulfide forms. In contrast, ceruloplasmin was a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidation of cysteine and cysteinylglycine to cystine and bis(-S-cysteinylglycine), respectively. However, when <el> thiol <le>s (cysteine and <re> homocysteine <er>) that are disulfide-bonded to albumin-Cys(34) are removed by treatment with dithiothreitol to form albumin-Cys(34)-SH (mercaptalbumin), the conversion of <re> homocysteine <er> to its disulfide forms is completely blocked. 
To examine the gonadotropic milieu presiding over recruitment and selection of a dominant follicle during <el> gonadotropin <le> induction of ovulation, four patients were studied over nine cycles of human pituitary <el> gonadotropin <le> (hPG) therapy. These hypogonadotropic subjects received a routine schedule of hPG injections monitored by daily urinary estrogen and pregnanediol determinations. Serum <re> FSH <er>, LH, and PRL profiles were measured in daily morning blood samples throughout each menstrual cycle. hPG therapy produced markedly abnormal <el> gonadotropin <le> patterns. Mean serum <re> FSH <er> levels were above the upper limit of the normal serum <re> FSH <er> range and no early or midfollicular <re> FSH <er> peaks occurred. The <re> FSH <er>-LH ratio was abnormally high for 8 days before ovulation. Progressive and marked elevations of serum PRL developed during hPG treatment. A bimodal luteal phase serum PRL profile appeared with peak values of 40.7 +/- 5.6 ng/ml (mean +/- SE) 1 day and 42.0 +/- 3.0 ng/ml 9 days after the LH peak. 
Thromboxane A(2) is a positive feedback lipid mediator produced following platelet activation. The G(q)-coupled <el> thromboxane <le> A(2) receptor subtype, TPalpha, and G(i)-coupled TPbeta subtype have been shown in human platelets. ADP-induced <re> platelet aggregation <er> requires concomitant signaling from two P2 receptor subtypes, P2Y1 and P2T(AC), coupled to G(q) and G(i), respectively. We investigated whether the stable <el> thromboxane <le> A(2) mimetic, (15S)-hydroxy-9, 11-epoxymethanoprosta-5Z,13E-dienoic acid (U46619), also causes <re> platelet aggregation <er> by concomitant signaling through G(q) and G(i), through co-activation of TPalpha and TPbeta receptor subtypes. Here we report that secretion blockade with Ro 31-8220, a protein kinase C inhibitor, completely inhibited U46619-induced, but not ADP- or thrombin-induced, <re> platelet aggregation <er>. Ro 31-8220 had no effect on U46619-induced intracellular calcium mobilization or platelet shape change. Furthermore, U46619-induced intracellular calcium mobilization and shape change were unaffected by A3P5P, a P2Y1 receptor-selective antagonist, and/or cyproheptadine, a 5-hydroxytryptamine subtype 2A receptor antagonist. Either Ro 31-8220 or AR-C66096, a P2T(AC) receptor selective antagonist, abolished U46619-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. In addition, AR-C66096 drastically inhibited U46619-mediated <re> platelet aggregation <er>, which was further inhibited by yohimbine, an alpha(2A)-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Furthermore, inhibition of U46619-induced <re> platelet aggregation <er> by Ro 31-8220 was relieved by activation of the G(i) pathway by selective activation of either the P2T(AC) receptor or the alpha(2A)-adrenergic receptor. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the <re> HER2 <er> expression in breast cancer is retained in <el> metastases <le>. The <re> HER2 <er> expression in primary tumours and the corresponding lymph node <el> metastases <le> were evaluated in parallel samples from 47 patients. The HercepTest was used for immunohistochemical analyses of <re> HER2 <er> overexpression in all cases. CISH/FISH was used for analysis of gene amplification in some cases. <re> HER2 <er> overexpression (<re> HER2 <er>-scores 2+ or 3+) was found in 55% of both the primary tumours and of the lymph node <el> metastases <le>. There were only small changes in the <re> HER2 <er>-scores; six from 1+ to 0 and one from 3+ to 2+ when the <el> metastases <le> were compared to the corresponding primary tumours. However, there were no cases with drastic changes in <re> HER2 <er> expression between the primary tumours and the corresponding lymph node <el> metastases <le>. 
The effects of nicotine and <el> cotinine <le>, the major metabolite of nicotine, on <re> testosterone <er> production in rat testis were investigated. Rat Leydig cells were isolated and incubated with nicotine and <el> cotinine <le>. Nicotine produced a dose dependent increase in progesterone levels and a dose-dependent decrease in androstenedione and <re> testosterone <er> concentrations. Cotinine produced a dose-dependent increase in progesterone and androstenedione and a dose-dependent decrease in <re> testosterone <er> levels. The effects of nicotine and <el> cotinine <le> on rat testis mitochondrial cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme and microsomal 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-isomerase, 17 alpha-hydroxylase, 17,20-lyase and 17-ketosteroid reductase were examined. Nicotine competitively inhibited 17 alpha-hydroxylase (apparent Ki = 30 microM) and 17,20-lyase (apparent Ki = 18 microM). Cotinine competitively inhibited 17-ketosteroid reductase (apparent Ki = 46 microM). The addition of nicotine to preparations of rat testis microsomes yielded a Type II cytochrome P-450 binding spectrum. 
In this study we assessed the effect of <el> acteoside <le> that significantly improved cell viability and inhibited lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Furthermore <el> acteoside <le> prevented a neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+)-induced <re> apoptosis <er> in CGNs. Accordingly, our flow cytometric analysis of CGNs after <el> acteoside <le> treatment revealed a decrease in the number of the MPP+-induced apoptotic cells (P < 0.001). Western blot analysis demonstrated that <el> acteoside <le> inhibits the active caspase-3 fragment (17 kDa) (P < 0.001) and the proteolytic poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) fragment (85 kDa) expression (P < 0.001) following MPP + treatment in CGNs. 
Previous research has demonstrated that a transient increase in interstitial <re> adenosine <er> and subsequent activation of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels are involved in triggering ischemic preconditioning (PC), however, the role of <re> adenosine <er> in mediating the cardioprotection of hypoxic PC and that produced by KATP channel openers is less clear. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the role of <re> adenosine <er> in mediating the cardioprotective effects of PC produced by 5 min of ischemia, <el> hypoxia <le>, or by a 5-min intracoronary (i.c.) infusion of the KATP channel opener bimakalim (1 microgram/min). A single microdialysis probe was implanted into the midwall of the ischemic area for sampling of interstitial fluid <re> adenosine <er> and its breakdown products during the PC stimulus, prolonged occlusion (60 min) and during the first 30 min of the reperfusion (3 h) period. Ischemic, hypoxic and bimakalim pretreatment significantly reduced infarct size, 5.3 +/- 1.5; 8.9 +/- 2.5; 11.4 +/- 3.2, respectively, as compared to control: 27.3 +/- 6.5. Both ischemic and hypoxic PC produced similar and significant increases (0.56 +/- 0.13 mumol/l to 1.12 +/- 0.12 mumol/l and 1.32 mumol, control, ischemic and hypoxic PC, respectively) in dialysate <re> adenosine <er> concentration which persisted during the brief 10-min reperfusion period following PC. However, i.c. bimakalim resulted in a significant decrease in dialysate <re> adenosine <er> (0.56 +/- 0.13 mumol/l to 0.22 +/- 0.04 mumol/l) which persisted during the 10-min drug-free period. All three PC protocols resulted in similar decreases in dialysate <re> adenosine <er>, inosine and uric acid concentrations throughout the prolonged ischemic period as compared to control animals. 
Negative myoclonus (NM) is a motor disorder characterized by a sudden and abrupt interruption of muscular activity. The EMG correlate of NM is a brief (<500 ms) silent period (SP) not preceded by any enhancement of EMG activity (i.e. myoclonus). This study investigated the role of premotor cortex (<el> PMC <le>), primary motor cortex (MI), primary somatosensory area (SI) and supplementary motor area (SMA) in the pathophysiology of cortical NM by means of intracerebral low frequency (1 Hz) electrical stimulation. In three drug-resistant epileptic patients undergoing presurgical evaluation, we delivered single electric pulses (stimulus duration: 3 ms; stimulus intensity ranging from 0.4 to 3 mA) to <el> PMC <le> (2 patients), MI (1 patient), SI and SMA through stereo-EEG electrodes; surface EMG was collected from both deltoids. The results showed that (i) the stimulation of <el> PMC <le> or MI could evoke a motor evoked potential (MEP) either at rest or during contraction, in this latter case followed by an SP; however, in two patients, at the lowest stimulus intensities (0.4 mA), 50% of stimuli could induce a pure SP, i.e. not preceded by an MEP; raising the intensity of stimulation (0.6 mA), the <re> SPs <er> showed an antecedent MEP in >80% of stimuli; (ii) the stimulation of SI at low stimulus intensities (from 0.4 to 0.8 mA) induced in two patients only <re> SPs <er>, never associated with an antecedent MEP, whereas in the third subject the <re> SPs <er> could be inconstantly preceded by an MEP; by incrementing the stimulus intensity (up to 3 mA), in all three patients the <re> SPs <er> tended to be preceded, although not constantly, by an MEP; stimulus intensity affected SP duration (i.e. the higher the intensity, the longer the SP), without influencing the latency of onset of the <re> SPs <er>; (iii) the stimulation of SMA induced only pure <re> SPs <er>, at all stimulus intensities up to 3 mA; as for SI, increment of stimulus intensity was paralleled by an increase in SP duration, without influencing the onset latency of <re> SPs <er>. 
Quantitative vestibulo-oculomotor tests and auditory brain stem responses were studied in 22 patients with <el> vestibular neuronitis <le> in a search for evidence of <re> CNS <er> affection. Such evidence was found in 16 of the 22; only in the other six could the examination findings be regarded as the result of damage limited to vestibular neuroepithelium or nerve. 
Release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the extracellular compartment and subsequent activation of purinergic receptors is a conserved mechanism mediating inflammatory responses and cell fate decisions in various organs including the liver. Previous findings suggest that extracellular ATP may promote liver tumorigenesis; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Therefore, our aim was to dissect the functions of extracellular ATP and P2Y2 receptors (<el> P2Y2R <le>) during hepatocarcinogenesis. Liver tumors were induced in wild-type and P2y2r-/- knock-out mice by intraperitoneal diethylnitrosamine (DEN) injection. Tumorigenesis was analyzed after 8-10 months and molecular analyses were performed at different stages of tumorigenesis in vivo, as well as in primary mouse hepatocytes in vitro. Liver tumor incidence and tumor numbers were strongly reduced in P2y2r-/- mice, whereas tumor size and morphology were comparable to wild-type controls, suggesting that <el> P2Y2R <le> contributes to tumor initiation. Mechanistically, hepatocyte proliferation in DEN-treated P2y2r-/- mice was reduced, which correlated with reduced c-JUN and CCND1 but increased p21 expression. Moreover, <re> DNA damage <er> as determined by hepatocellular expression of γH2A.X and of genes related to genotoxic stress, as well as STAT3 phosphorylation, was reduced in the absence of P2y2r. Administration of genotoxic agents to primary hepatocytes in vitro confirmed that <re> DNA damage <er> was indeed exacerbated by extracellular ATP, subsequent <el> P2Y2R <le> activation and downstream intracellular calcium-dependent signal transduction. 
Progesterone production by the corpus luteum is a process vital for reproduction. In humans its secretion is stimulated by the placental hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and this stimulatory action can also be observed in cultured human luteinized granulosa cells (GCs). We now provide evidence that opening of a Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel, the <el> BK <le>(Ca), is crucially involved in this process. Immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR revealed the presence of the pore-forming alpha-subunit in human luteinized GCs and in luteal cells of human, macaque, and rat, implying that <el> BK <le>(Ca) channels are important throughout species. Blocking of <el> BK <le>(Ca) channels by iberiotoxin attenuated hCG-induced progesterone secretion. The inhibitory action of iberiotoxin suggests that <el> BK <le>(Ca) channels are activated in the course of hCG-induced <re> steroidogenesis <er>. In search of physiological activators we used an electrophysiological approach and could preclude a direct regulation of channel activity by hCG or GC-derived steroids (progesterone and 17beta-estradiol). Instead, the peptide hormone oxytocin and an acetylcholine (ACh) agonist, carbachol, evoked transient <el> BK <le>(Ca) currents and membrane hyperpolarization. These two molecules are both secreted by GCs and act via raised intracellular Ca(2+) levels. The release of oxytocin is stimulated by hCG, and a similar mechanism is likely in the case of ACh. 
The mechanisms of the progesterone (<el> P4 <le>)-activated Ca2+ influx and the relationship between the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and the acrosome reaction (<re> AR <er>) were investigated in this study. We compared the [Ca2+]i of uncapacitated and capacitated human sperm populations in response to <el> P4 <le> stimulation; characterized the effects of the pharmacological agents pimozide and mibefradil, inhibitors of T-type voltage-operated calcium channels (VOCCT), on the <el> P4 <le>-activated Ca2+ influx; and determined the effects of these drugs on the <el> P4 <le>-initiated <re> AR <er>. Since pimozide can also inhibit calmodulin-dependent enzymes, we examined the effects of the calmodulin antagonist, calmidazolium, on the above-mentioned events. The basal [Ca2+]i and the amplitude of the <el> P4 <le>-activated Ca2+ influx were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in capacitated sperm populations. Also, in capacitated sperm populations, all three pharmacological agents significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited the <el> P4 <le>-activated Ca2+ influx (IC50): calmidazolium (0.7 microM) > pimozide (8 microM) > mibefradil (11 microM). By contrast, the effects of these drugs on the <el> P4 <le>-initiated <re> AR <er> were varied: pimozide (10 and 20 microM) significantly (p < 0.05) increased the percentage of <re> AR <er> spermatozoa, calmidazolium was without effect, and mibefradil (20 microM) significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited the <re> AR <er>. 
Cholesterol absorption and metabolism and LDL and HDL kinetics were investigated in 11 hypercholesterolaemic non-insulin-dependent diabetic men off and on a hypolipidaemic treatment with sitostanol <el> ester <le>, (3 g sitostanol daily) dissolved in rapeseed oil margarine, by a double-blind crossover study design. Serum total, VLDL and LDL cholesterol and apoprotein B fell significantly by 6 +/- 2, 12 +/- 6, 9 +/- 3 and 6 +/- 2%, mean +/- SEM, and HDL cholesterol was increased by 11 +/- 4% (p < 0.05) by sitostanol <el> ester <le>. LDL cholesterol and apoprotein B were significantly decreased in the dense (1.037-1.055 g/ml), but not light, LDL subfraction due to a significantly diminished <re> transport <er> rate for LDL apoprotein B, while the fractional catabolic rate was unchanged. HDL kinetics, measured with autologous apoprotein A I, was unaffected by sitostanol <el> ester <le>. Cholesterol absorption efficiency was markedly reduced from 25 +/- 2 to 9 +/- 2% (p < 0.001) during sitostanol <el> ester <le> followed by proportionately decreased serum plant sterol proportions. Cholesterol precursor sterol proportions in serum, fecal neutral sterol excretion, and cholesterol synthesis, cholesterol <re> transport <er>, and biliary secretion were all significantly increased by sitostanol <el> ester <le>. 
The active form of vitamin D, 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(<el> OH <le>)(2)D) inhibits the growth of prostate epithelial cells, however the underlying mechanisms have not been clearly delineated. In the current study, the impact of 1,25(<el> OH <le>)(2)D on the rapid activation of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and protein kinase C alpha (PKC alpha), and the role of these pathways in growth inhibition was examined in immortalized mouse prostate epithelial cells, <re> MPEC3 <er>, that exhibit stem/progenitor cell characteristics. 1,25(<el> OH <le>)(2)D treatment suppressed the growth of <re> MPEC3 <er> in a dose and time dependent manner (e.g., 21% reduction at three days with 100 nM 1,25(<el> OH <le>)(2)D treatment). However, ERK1/2 activity was not altered by 100 nM 1,25(<el> OH <le>)(2)D treatment for time points from 1 min to 1 h in either serum-containing or serum-free medium. 
The cardioactive diterpene <el> forskolin <le> is a known activator of adenylate cyclase, but recently a specific interaction of this compound with the glucose transporter has been identified that results in the inhibition of glucose transport in several human and rat cell types. We have compared the sensitivity of basal and insulin-stimulated <re> hexose transport <er> to inhibition by <el> forskolin <le> in skeletal muscle cells of the L6 line. Forskolin completely inhibited both basal and insulin-stimulated <re> hexose transport <er> when present during the transport assay. The inhibition of basal transport was completely reversible upon removal of the diterpene. In contrast, insulin-stimulated <re> hexose transport <er> did not recover, and basal transport levels were attained instead. This effect of inhibiting (or reversing) the insulin-stimulated fraction of transport is a novel effect of the diterpene. Forskolin treatment also inhibited the stimulated fraction of transport when the stimulus was by 4 beta-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, reversing back to basal levels. Half-maximal inhibition of the above-basal insulin-stimulated transport was achieved with 35-50 microM-<el> forskolin <le>, and maximal inhibition with 100 microM. Forskolin did not inhibit 125I-insulin binding under conditions where it caused significant inhibition of insulin-stimulated <re> hexose transport <er>. Forskolin significantly elevated the cyclic AMP levels in the cells; however its inhibitory effect on the above basal, insulin-stimulated fraction of <re> hexose transport <er> was not mediated by cyclic AMP since: (i) 8-bromo cyclic AMP and cholera toxin did not mimic this effect of the diterpene, (ii) significant decreases in cyclic AMP levels caused by 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine in the presence of <el> forskolin <le> did not prevent inhibition of insulin-stimulated <re> hexose transport <er>, (iii) isobutylmethylxanthine did not potentiate <el> forskolin <le> effects on glucose transport but did potentiate the elevation in cyclic AMP, and (iv) 1,9-dideoxyforskolin, which does not activate adenylate cyclase, inhibited <re> hexose transport <er> analogously to <el> forskolin <le>. 
Controversy exists whether early aggressive fluid therapy in the setting of uncontrolled hemorrhage worsens outcome by increasing blood loss from injured vessels. Since diaspirin crosslinked hemoglobin (<el> DCLHb <le>) is a vasoactive, oxygen-carrying solution, we compared the effects of <el> DCLHb <le> with other resuscitative fluids on blood loss, hemodynamics, and tissue oxygen delivery in a model of uncontrolled hemorrhage. Anesthetized rats (250-350 g) were subjected to a 50% tail transection and resuscitated 15 minutes later with 1:1 <el> DCLHb <le>, 3:1 lactated Ringer's solution (LR), 1:1 hypertonic saline (7.5% HTS), or 1:1 human serum albumin (8.3% HSA) based on initial volume of blood loss (average 4.7 +/- 0.3 mL/kg). An unresuscitated group served as a control. Cumulative blood loss was measured at 5 hours postresuscitation. By 15 minutes after tail transection, mean arterial pressure (<re> MAP <er>) decreased 19.2 +/- 3.8 mm Hg from the baseline value (102 +/- 5 mm Hg). The <el> DCLHb <le> solution restored and maintained <re> MAP <er> and subcutaneous tissue oxygen tension at baseline values better than all other resuscitative fluids. Although blood loss in <el> DCLHb <le>-treated animals was greater than in unresuscitated animals, it was no different from other resuscitative fluids and less than with HSA. There was no difference in 24-hour survival between all treatment groups. 
Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, thus understanding the molecular basis for EAC <re> invasion <er> and metastasis is critical. Here we report that SPP1/OPN was highly overexpressed in primary EACs and intracellularly localized to tumor cells. We further demonstrate that all known OPN isoforms (OPNa, b, c, 4 and 5) were frequently co-overexpressed in primary EACs. Distinct pro-<re> invasion <er> and dissemination phenotypes of isoform-specific OPNb and <el> OPNc <le> stable transfectants were observed. Expression of OPNb significantly enhanced cell migration and adhesion to laminin. In contrast, <el> OPNc <le> cells showed significantly decreased cell migration yet increased cell detachment. Enhanced <re> invasion <er>, both in vitro and in vivo, was observed for OPNb- but not <el> OPNc <le>-expressing cells. Inhibition of RGD integrins, one family of OPN receptors, attenuated OPNb cell migration, abrogated OPNb cell adhesion and significantly reduced OPNb cell clonogenic survival but did not affect <el> OPNc <le> phenotypes, indicating that OPNb but not <el> OPNc <le> acts through integrin-dependent signaling. Differential expression of vimentin, E-cadherin and β-catenin in OPN stable cells may account for the variation in cell adhesion and detachment between these isoforms. 
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of plaque biofilm removal on the mitochondrial activity of human SaOs-2 osteoblasts grown on titanium surfaces. Volunteers wore acrylic splints with structured titanium discs for 72 h to build up plaque biofilms (n = 30). Specimens were randomly instrumented using either (1) an ultrasonic system at two power settings (EMS1, EMS2) + chlorhexidine (CHX), or (2) plastic curettes + CHX. Untreated (NC, n = 10) and sterile (C, n = 10) titanium discs served as controls. Specimens were incubated with SaOs-2 cells for 6 days. Treatment time (T), residual plaque biofilm (<el> RPB <le>)/clean implant surface areas (%), mitochondrial cell activity (<re> MA <er>) (counts/second), and cell morphology (SEM) were assessed. Statistical analysis revealed the following mean scores (+/-SD): <el> RPB <le> areas: P (58.5 +/- 4.9) > EMS1 (38.4 +/- 4.1) > EMS2 (28.3 +/- 2.0); T: PC (292 +/- 30) = EMS1 (244 +/- 24) > EMS2 (199 +/- 25); <re> MA <er>: C (1.544.661 +/- 203.442) > PC (597.559 +/- 566.984) = EMS2 (389.875 +/- 409.300) = EMS1 (356.653 +/- 293.863; n.s.) > NC (138.676 +/- 86.666). In NC and PC groups, cells were predominantly rounded in shape. However, in the EMS groups, some cells had started to spread, showing complete cytoplasmatic extensions of the cell body on the titanium surface. A monolayer of flattened cells was generally observed in the C group. 
Lethal circulatory shock during microbial sepsis is thought to be initiated by early molecular events, including production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and cytokine-mediated upregulation of neutrophil (PMN) function, irrespective of the causative organism. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor pentoxifylline (<el> PTX <le>) inhibits TNF gene transcription and modulates PMN function, and has been shown to improve outcome in experimental sepsis. We hypothesized that <el> PTX <le> would attenuate <re> gram <er>-negative and fungal septic shock by different mechanisms: reduced TNF production in Escherichia coli (EC) sepsis vs. enhanced PMN-mediated defense during Candida albicans (CA) fungemia. Conscious chronically catheterized rats received <el> PTX <le> (25 mg/kg, i.v.) before i.v. challenge with 10(10) viable EC (serotype 055:B5), 10(9) viable serotype A yeast-phase CA (each the LD100 in < 24 hr in naive rats), or normal sterile saline (NSS), and then <el> PTX <le> posttreatment (6.5 mg/hr x 4.5 hr). Treatment controls received NSS before and after challenge. Serum TNF peaked 1.5 hr after EC infection in NSS-treated animals (1654 +/- 390 U/ml, mean +/- SE), and was significantly reduced by <el> PTX <le> (120 +/- 32 U/ml, P < 0.01), but <el> PTX <le> did not improve 24 hr survival. <el> PTX <le> also aggravated systemic hypotension after EC, and did not modify neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or microvascular permeability assessed by organ wet/dry weight (W/D) ratios. Peak serum TNF in CA + NSS animals (130 +/- 45 U/ml) was delayed 8 hr compared to EC animals, and were not reduced by <el> PTX <le> (67 +/- 25 U/ml, P = NS). Moreover, <el> PTX <le> did not alter CA-induced mortality, hypothermia, hypotension, neutropenia, increased lung W/D, or interstitial and alveolar hemorrhage. 
We examined whether insulin and catecholamines share common pathways for their stimulating effects on <re> glucose uptake <er>. We perfused isolated working rat hearts with Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing [2-3H]glucose (5 mmol/L, 0.05 microCi/mL) and sodium oleate (0.4 mmol/L). In the absence or presence of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitor wortmannin (3 micromol/L), we added insulin (1 mU/mL), epinephrine (1 micromol/L), phenylephrine (100 micromol/L) plus propranolol (10 micromol/L, selective <el> alpha-adrenergic <le> stimulation), or isoproterenol (1 micromol/L) plus phentolamine (10 micromol/L, selective beta-adrenergic stimulation) to the perfusate. Cardiac power was found to be stable in all groups (between 8.07+/-0.68 and 10.7+/-0. 88 mW) and increased (25% to 47%) with addition of epinephrine, but not with selective alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation. Insulin and epinephrine, as well as selective alpha- and beta-receptor stimulation, increased <re> glucose uptake <er> (the following values are in micromol/[min. g dry weight]: basal, 1.19+/-0.13; insulin, 3.89+/-0.36; epinephrine, 3.46+/-0.27; alpha-stimulation, 4.08+/-0.40; and beta-stimulation, 3.72+/-0.34). Wortmannin completely inhibited insulin-stimulated and selective alpha-stimulated <re> glucose uptake <er>, but it did not affect the epinephrine-stimulated or selective beta-stimulated <re> glucose uptake <er>. Sequential addition of insulin and epinephrine or insulin and alpha-selective stimulation showed additive effects on <re> glucose uptake <er> in both cases. Wortmannin further blocked the effects of insulin on glycogen synthesis. 
This study was undertaken to examine changes in Zn and <re> Cu <er> homeostasis in the liver and kidney of rats caused by cadmium (<el> Cd <le>) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. Twenty-five male, 7- to 8-week-old Wistar rats were divided into five groups: saline only treatment, saline treatment and food deprivation, exposure to a single dose of <el> Cd <le>, exposure to LPS alone, and exposure to <el> Cd <le> + LPS. Changes in plasma nitrate concentrations and hepatic and renal Zn and <re> Cu <er> contents were measured together with urinary excretion rates for the metals and nitrate on 3 consecutive days: 24 h before treatment and 24 and 48 h after treatments. <el> Cd <le> exposure alone for 48 h caused a nearly 2-fold increase in plasma nitrate levels with no changes in urinary nitrate excretion whereas LPS treatment caused plasma nitrate levels to increase by 10-fold and urinary nitrate excretion to increase by 4-fold. Administration of LPS 24 h after <el> Cd <le> exposure caused a 10-fold increase in plasma nitrate concentrations and a 100-fold increase in urinary nitrate excretion compared to the rates prior to LPS administration. These results indicate a synergistic interaction between <el> Cd <le> and LPS toxicity. <el> Cd <le> exposure also caused a marked increase in hepatic Zn levels, but LPS did not cause any changes in hepatic Zn or <re> Cu <er> content. In sharp contrast, both Zn and <re> Cu <er> contents were decreased in the kidneys by 16 and 36% in animals exposed to <el> Cd <le> or LPS. A correlation analysis of measured variables reveals that renal <re> Cu <er> contents were inversely associated with plasma nitrate concentrations while urinary <re> Cu <er> excretion on day 3 showed a strong positive correlation with both urinary nitrate and <el> Cd <le> excretions on the same day. A linear regression analysis shows 20% of the variation in urinary <re> Cu <er> excretion was associated with urinary <el> Cd <le> excretion on the same day. 
Flavonoids have been proposed to act as chemopreventive agents in numerous epidemiological studies and have been shown to inhibit angiogenesis and proliferation of tumor cells and endothelial cells in vitro. Angiogenesis requires tightly controlled extracellular matrix degradation mediated by extracellular proteolytic enzymes including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and serine proteases, in particular, the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)-plasmin system. In this study, we have investigated the antiangiogenic mechanism of the flavonoids, genistein, apigenin, and <el> 3-hydroxyflavone <le> in a human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) model. The stimulation of serum-starved HUVECs with vascular endothelial growth factor/basic fibroblast growth factor (VEGF/bFGF) caused marked increase in MMP-1 production and induced the pro-MMP-2 activation accompanied by the increase in MT1-MMP expression. However, pretreatment with flavonoids before VEGF/bFGF stimulation completely abolished the VEGF/bFGF-stimulated increase in MMP-1 and MT1-MMP expression and pro-MMP-2 activation. Genistein blocked VEGF/bFGF-stimulated increase in TIMP-1 expression and decrease in TIMP-2 expression. Apigenin and <el> 3-hydroxyflavone <le> further decreased TIMP-1 expression below basal level and completely abolished TIMP-2 expression. VEGF and bFGF stimulation also significantly induced <re> uPA expression <er>, most strikingly the level of 33 kDa uPA, and increased the expression of PA inhibitor (PAI)-1. Genistein, apigenin, and <el> 3-hydroxyflavone <le> effectively blocked the generation of 33 kDa uPA, and further decreased the activity of the 55 kDa uPA and the expression of PAI-1 below the basal level. 
Delayed joining of DNA strand breaks and a high spontaneous level of sister-chromatid exchanges (SCEs) are characteristics of the mutant cell strain EM9 of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The introduction of the human gene <el> XRCC1 <le> into EM9 cells reverts the phenotypic properties of EM9 to those of the wild type. We have investigated both DNA ligase activities and a protein which stimulates DNA ligase activity in mutant EM9 cells, <el> XRCC1 <le>-transfectant H9T3-7-1 cells and wild-type AA8 cells. Our results, which demonstrate both a decreased DNA ligase activity in EM9 cells using poly(rA).oligo(dT) as substrate and a decreased ability of <re> DNA ligase III <er> to form a covalent <re> DNA ligase III <er>-adenylate intermediate with AMP, clearly indicate an altered <re> DNA ligase III <er> activity in the mutant. Furthermore, the AMP-binding capacity of <re> DNA ligase III <er> and its enzymatic activity with the synthetic polymer were restored after transfection of EM9 with the human <el> XRCC1 <le> gene. Immunoblotting data suggest that the <el> XRCC1 <le> gene does not code for <re> DNA ligase III <er>. 
Intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (<el> I/R <le>) induces mucosal barrier dysfunction and bacterial translocation (<re> BT <er>). Neutrophil-derived oxidative free radicals have been incriminated in the pathogenesis of ischemic injury in various organs, but their role in the bacteria-containing intestinal tract is debatable. Primed neutrophils are characterized by a faster and higher respiratory burst activity associated with more robust bactericidal effects on exposure to a second stimulus. Hypoxic preconditioning (HPC) attenuates ischemic injury in brain, heart, lung and kidney; no reports were found in the gut. Our aim is to investigate whether neutrophil priming by HPC protects against intestinal <el> I/R <le>-induced barrier damage and bacterial influx. Rats were raised in normoxia (NM) or kept in a hypobaric hypoxic chamber (380 Torr) 17 h/day for 3 weeks for HPC, followed by sham operation or intestinal <el> I/R <le>. Gut permeability was determined by using an ex vivo macromolecular flux assay and an in vivo magnetic resonance imaging-based method. Liver and spleen homogenates were plated for bacterial culturing. Rats raised in HPC showed diminished levels of <re> BT <er>, and partially improved mucosal histopathology and epithelial barrier function compared with the NM groups after intestinal <el> I/R <le>. Augmented cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC)-1 and -3 levels and myeloperoxidase activity correlated with enhanced infiltration of neutrophils in intestines of HPC-<el> I/R <le> compared with NM-<el> I/R <le> rats. HPC alone caused blood neutrophil priming, as shown by elevated production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide on stimulation, increased membrane translocation of cytosolic p47(phox) and p67(phox), as well as augmented bacterial-killing and phagocytotic activities. Neutrophil depletion reversed the mucosal protection by HPC, and aggravated intestinal leakiness and <re> BT <er> following <el> I/R <le>. 
Pharmacological preconditioning (PC) with tadalafil, a PDE5A inhibitor, enhances protein kinase G-1 (<re> PKG-I <er>) activity, resulting in stem cell survival. Protection by PC had two different phases, early (2 h) and late (24 h). However, the mechanism of protection during these phases remained grossly unknown. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from adult male Fischer-344 rats were cultured and pretreated with tadalafil (100 μM) for an hour and subjected to 2 h of hypoxia (1% O2), followed by reoxygenation (HR: in vitro model mimicking ischemia/reperfusion). We observed (i) increased MSC survival with reduced cell cytotoxicity as revealed by low lactate dehydrogenase release and trypan blue staining, respectively, in tadalafil-treated cells upon HR; (ii) decrease in TUNEL positivity as well as caspase activity; (iii) an increase in pAkt/Akt, iNOS, eNOS, and pGSK3β/GSK3β during the early protection phase of PC, and this protection seemed to be a spontaneous adaptive response of MSCs against HR and was independent of tadalafil, whereas an increase in Bcl2/Bax was tadalafil dependent; and (iv) during the late phase, we observed phosphorylation of <el> STAT3 <le> at serine727, leading to its entry inside the nucleus and binding onto the promoter of <re> PKG-I <er> by three-fold (P<0.05). 
We previously demonstrated that pinacidil does not affect Na(+)(i) accumulation, cellular energy depletion, or <re> acidosis <er> during myocardial ischemia, but dramatically improves the cationic/energetic status during reperfusion. We investigated the role of this latter effect in K(<el> ATP <le>) channel-induced cardioprotection. Employing (23)Na and (31)P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with perfused rat hearts, reperfusion Na(+)(i) was altered with brief infusions of ouabain and/or RbCl to transiently decrease or increase Na(+)/K(+) <el> ATP <le>ase activity. The increases and decreases in functional recovery (%LVDP-R) with pinacidil or ouabain, respectively, were largely unaltered by each other's presence. Early reperfusion Na(+)(i) and cellular energy were greatly altered by ouabain and indicated linear relationships with %LVDP-R. Pinacidil shifted these relationships to higher %LVDP-R. Increasing early reperfusion Na(+)(i) decreased %LVDP-R but did not diminish pinacidil's capacity to improve %LVDP-R. Approximately 75% and 45% of the pinacidil-induced improvements in %LVDP-R, could be disassociated from early reperfusion Na(+)(i) and cellular energy, respectively. Both pinacidil and RbCl infusion blunted ouabain's elevation of reperfusion Na(+)(i), but RbCl did not improve %LVDP-R. Atomic absorption tissue Ca(2+) measurements indicated that pinacidil reduced late reperfusion Ca(2+) uptake, but did not reduce early reperfusion Ca(2+), and its beneficial effects were resistant to ouabain-induced early reperfusion Ca(2+) increases. 
CYP17 gene transcription is activated by SF-1 binding to a cyclic AMP-responsive sequence within the promoter region of the gene, and its transcription is inhibited by COUP-TF binding to the sequence. Another orphan receptor, DAX-1, is shown to act as a suppressor of SF-1-mediated transcription. We examined the expression level of these orphan receptors in adrenocortical <el> tumors <le> and compared the results with CYP17 expression. CYP17 was highly expressed in cortisol-producing adenomas, whereas COUP-TF and DAX-1 expression levels were very low. In <re> deoxycorticosterone <er>-producing adenomas, on the other hand, CYP17 expression was extremely low, whereas DAX-1 was highly expressed and SF-1 expression was slightly decreased. 
An abnormal growth hormone (GH) increase after non-specific stimuli (such as TRH, LHRH and, in a few cases, metoclopramide), has been described in insulin-dependent diabetes. Sixty-nine non-hypogonadic male insulin-dependent diabetic patients (mean age 38.6 years, range 18-54; mean duration of diabetes 11.1 years, range 1.3-28, in different degree of metabolic control, some of them with retinopathy, nephropathy and peripheral and/or autonomic neuropathy) were tested twice with 10 mg i.v. metoclopramide (<el> MCP <le>), an antidopaminergic agent with weak serotoninergic activity. Anomalous GH response (i.e. GH increment equal to or higher than 5 ng/ml from basal level) occurred in 33 patients (47.8%). Mean (+/- SE) <el> MCP <le>-induced <re> GH release <er> in these 'responder' patients peaked up to 17.2 +/- 1.7 ng/ml in comparison with no variation found in 'non-responders' and in 25 healthy control men. Abnormal GH secretion appeared to be unrelated to age, metabolic control, basal GH values and duration of diabetes. Moreover, it remained unmodified by pretreatments with placebo, cimetidine, meclastine, propranolol, acetylsalicylic acid and naloxone, while it was enhanced by metergoline, significantly reduced by bromocriptine and almost completely blunted by pirenzepine, a cholinergic muscarinic receptor antagonist. Neuropathy and nephropathy were equally distributed in the two groups, while retinopathy was more frequent in 'responders'. 
Accumulation of matrix proteins is a prominent feature of diabetic nephropathy. Glomerular visceral epithelial cells (GVECs) are important contributors to extracellular matrix (ECM) production in the glomerulus. Factors involved with increased accumulation of ECM proteins are high <el> glucose <le>, angiotensin II (ANG II), and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. Therefore, we investigated the effects of high <el> glucose <le> and ANG II on <re> fibronectin <er> and TGF-beta production by human GVECs in vitro. We found that ANG II had no effect on the production of <re> fibronectin <er> and TGF-beta by GVECs. Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, no ANG II receptor could be detected on these cells. However, high <el> glucose <le> induced a twofold increase in <re> fibronectin <er> (P < 0.01) and a three- to sixfold increase in TGF-beta (P < 0.001) production. Similar results were obtained by analyzing the mRNA levels of <re> fibronectin <er> (increased 2.7-fold) and TGF-beta (increased 3.5-fold). Addition of increasing concentrations of rTGF-beta to control cells resulted in increased <re> fibronectin <er> production. Neutralizing antibodies against TGF-beta significantly reversed the increase in <re> fibronectin <er> protein and mRNA caused by high <el> glucose <le> back to control levels. 
Glucocorticoid excess predisposes to the development of diabetes, at least in part through impairment of insulin secretion. The underlying mechanism has remained elusive. We show here that dexamethasone upregulates transcription and expression of the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (<el> SGK1 <le>) in insulin-secreting cells, an effect reversed by mifepristone (RU486), an antagonist of the nuclear glucocorticoid receptor. When coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes, <el> SGK1 <le> increases the activity of <re> voltage-gated <er> K(+) channel K(v)1.5. In INS-1 cells, dexamethasone stimulates the transcription of K(v)1.5, increases the repolarizing outward current, reduces peak values of [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations, and decreases glucose-induced insulin release. The latter effect is reversed by K(+) channel blockers 4-aminopyridine and tetraethylammonium and by a more selective K(v)1.5 channel inhibitor MSD-D. Dexamethasone also increases expression of K(v)1.5 in mouse islets and reduces glucose-induced insulin secretion, an effect reversed by MSD-D. In islets isolated from wild-type but not <el> SGK1 <le> knockout mice, dexamethasone significantly blunted glucose-, forskolin-, and phorbol myristic acid-induced insulin release. 
Normobaric <el> hyperoxia <le> decreases heart rate (HR) in humans and animals. This study explored the mechanisms of hyperoxic <re> bradycardia <er> by examining its response time, autonomic neural mediation, and reversibility in conscious dogs. Five trained mongrel dogs breathed from a mask as the inspired gas was alternated between air and O2 for multiple cycles, and continuous time series records of HR and oxyhemoglobin saturation were recorded on a digital computer and analyzed by the technique of ensemble averaging. Hyperoxia decreased HR by 9% (P < 0.001), but only gradually, requiring 5 min to reach steady state. This delay was much longer than the time required for hyperoxic respiratory depression (10-20 s), a response known to be mediated by chemoreceptor reflexes. The <re> bradycardia <er> was sustained for > or = 30 min. On return to normoxia, HR gradually returned toward, but failed to reach, the baseline HR, suggesting incomplete reversibility of the response. However, in control experiments without hyperoxic challenge, HR showed a slow continuous downward trend that was sufficient to account for the apparent incomplete reversibility of hyperoxic <re> bradycardia <er>. Hyperoxic <re> bradycardia <er> was unaffected by beta-adrenergic blockade but was completely prevented by muscarinic cholinergic blockade. 
Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4)-immunoglobulin (Ig) has immunosuppressive properties both in vivo and in vitro, but much is still unknown about the mechanisms by which CTLA-4-Ig exerts its immunosuppressive activities in vivo. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of CTLA-4-Ig in a mouse model of contact hypersensitivity (<re> CHS <er>). The inflammatory response in the presence or absence of CTLA-4-Ig was evaluated by measuring the increase in ear thickness in sensitized animals after challenge. We observed a dose-dependent suppression of the ear swelling in both dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB)- and <el> oxazolone <le>-induced <re> CHS <er>. The suppressive effect was still present 3 weeks after administration, even in the absence of circulating levels of CTLA-4-Ig. It was further shown that CTLA-4-Ig inhibits activation of T cells in the draining lymph node after sensitization and affects the maturation level of both dendritic cells and B cells. Furthermore, CTLA-4-Ig reduces infiltration of activated CD8(+)  T cells into the inflamed ear tissue and suppresses both local and systemic inflammation, as illustrated by reduced expression of cytokines and chemokines in the inflamed ear and a reduced level of acute-phase proteins in circulation. Finally, our results suggest that CTLA-4-Ig has a mainly immunosuppressive effect during the sensitization phase. 
Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU), a life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus, have limited treatment options, often resulting in amputations. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as statins are cholesterol-reducing agents that may provide a new therapeutic option. Statins target the cholesterol pathway and block the synthesis of the wound-healing inhibitors farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and cortisol, ligands for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Here we demonstrate that the naturally occurring statin, <el> mevastatin <le>, reverses FPP's effects and promotes healing by using in vitro wound healing assays, human ex vivo and porcine in vivo wound models, and DFU tissue. Moreover, we measured cortisol levels by ELISA and found <el> mevastatin <le> inhibited cortisol synthesis in keratinocytes and biopsies from patients with DFU. Of note, topical <el> mevastatin <le> stimulated epithelialization and angiogenesis in vivo. Mevastatin also reversed FPP-mediated induction of the GR target, the transcription factor c-Myc (a biomarker of nonhealing wounds) in porcine and human wound models. Importantly, <el> mevastatin <le> reversed c-Myc overexpression in DFUs. It induced expression of the long noncoding (lnc)-RNA <re> Gas5 <er> that blocks c-Myc expression, which was confirmed by overexpression studies. 
This study aimed to assess the effect of two sessions of acute physical exercise at 50% VO2peak performed under <el> hypoxia <le> (equivalent to an altitude of 4500 m for 28 h) on <re> sleep <er>, mood and reaction time. Forty healthy men were randomized into 4 groups: Normoxia (NG) (n = 10); Hypoxia (HG) (n = 10); Exercise under Normoxia (ENG) (n = 10); and Exercise under Hypoxia (EHG) (n = 10). All mood and reaction time assessments were performed 40 min after awakening. Sleep was reassessed on the first day at 14 h after the initiation of <el> hypoxia <le>; mood and reaction time were measured 28 h later. Two sessions of acute physical exercise at 50% VO2peak were performed for 60 min on the first and second days after 3 and 27 h, respectively, after starting to <el> hypoxia <le>. Improved <re> sleep <er> efficiency, stage N3 and REM <re> sleep <er> and reduced wake after <re> sleep <er> onset were observed under <el> hypoxia <le> after acute physical exercise. Tension, anger, depressed mood, vigor and reaction time scores improved after exercise under <el> hypoxia <le>. 
The relation between the intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (<el> cAMP <le>) content and the electrogenic <re> chloride secretion <er> induced by cholera toxin was studied in secretory HT-29 cl 19A cell monolayers. Cells were treated by the mucosal addition of cholera toxin (5 micrograms/ml) for 10, 45, or 90 minutes in Ussing chambers. After 10 minutes, the mean (SEM) intracellular <el> cAMP <le> content (3.2 (0.2) pmol/mg protein) and short circuit current (Isc) (1.9 (0.3) microA.cm-2) did not differ significantly from the corresponding basal values. At 45 minutes, a significant increase in the Isc (22.2 (5.7) microA.cm-2) was accompanied by a significant elevation in <el> cAMP <le> (10(1.7) pmol/mgh protein). At 90 minutes, when the stimulated Isc plateaued (35.2 (5.2) microA.cm-2), the <el> cAMP <le> value (99.2 (23.8) pmol/mg protein) increased further. The protein kinase C (PKC) activity of the cells was not affected by cholera toxin. Treatment of cell monolayers by different concentrations of DbcAMP (10(5), 5 x 10(-5), 10(-3) M) showed that the minimal concentration of DbcAMP (serosal) which significantly increased the Isc (delta 4.5 microA.cm-2) was 10(-4) M, and that this was accompanied by an increase in <el> cAMP <le> of delta 6.7 pmol/mg protein: Compared with DbcAMP, cholera toxin stimulated the Isc (at 45 minutes) to a much higher degree with a comparable elevation of <el> cAMP <le>. 
Angiopeptin is an analog of somatostatin-14, which has been found to inhibit cellular proliferation in several models of systemic vascular injury. As proliferation plays a major role in <re> pulmonary hypertension <er>, we examined the hypothesis that <el> angiopeptin <le> would inhibit the development of chronic hypoxic <re> pulmonary hypertension <er> in the rat. Angiopeptin was infused intravenously (90-100 microg/kg/day) by minipumps in 10 rats during a 3-week exposure to hypobaric hypoxia and in six normoxic rats. Normal saline was infused in six hypoxic control rats and in seven normoxic control rats. Angiopeptin produced no significant difference in mean pulmonary arterial pressure and resistance, right ventricular weight, or medial thickness of small pulmonary vessels. Vasoconstrictor responses of isolated lungs to acute hypoxia were not affected by <el> angiopeptin <le>. 
Could pre-operative dietary intervention with <el> fish <le> oil reduce <re> neutrophil activation <er> and myocardial damage associated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)? Patients were randomised to receive either 8 g/day <el> fish <le> oil (n=22) or placebo (n=18) for 6 weeks. Neutrophil activation, apoptosis and cardiac damage were measured. Demographics and operative variables were similar. Fish oil diet decreased plasma VLDL from 0.69+/-0.34 to 0.51+/-0.24 mmol/l and triglycerides from 1.68+/-0.70 to 1.39+/-0.54 mmol/l. HDL cholesterol increased from 0.94+/-0.27 to 1.03+/-0.26 mmol/l demonstrating significant treatment effects (P=0.007, 0.02 and 0.0003, respectively) as well as compliance with treatment. There were no significant differences in ex vivo N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-stimulated neutrophil superoxide anion generation or myeloperoxidase release at recruitment, pre-operatively and at end-CPB. Apoptosis at end-CPB was equally reduced in both groups from 23+/-9% to 13+/-4% in the <el> fish <le> oil group (P<0.001) and 35+/-14% to 15+/-3% in the placebo group (P=0.001). At end-CPB overall troponin I levels averaged 0.91+/-0.60 ng/ml which clearly exceeded diagnostic levels (0.15 ng/ml). At 24h troponin I fell significantly in the <el> fish <le> oil group to 46+/-23% of end-CPB levels (P=0.0002) whereas it peaked in the placebo group to 107+/-72% (P=0.098 vs. end-CPB); this difference was significant: P=0.013. At 48 h the placebo-treated patients had higher troponins but not significantly so (P=0.059). Area-under-the-curve analysis did not conclusively support this (P=0.068). 
Fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing basket cells (<el> BCs <le>) represent a major type of inhibitory interneuron in the hippocampus. These cells inhibit principal cells in a temporally precise manner and are involved in the generation of network oscillations. Although <el> BCs <le> show a unique expression profile of <re> Ca <er>(2+)-permeable receptors, <re> Ca <er>(2+)-binding proteins and <re> Ca <er>(2+)-dependent signalling molecules, physiological <re> Ca <er>(2+) signalling in these interneurons has not been investigated. To study action potential (AP)-induced dendritic <re> Ca <er>(2+) influx and buffering, we combined whole-cell patch-clamp recordings with ratiometric <re> Ca <er>(2+) imaging from the proximal apical dendrites of rigorously identified <el> BCs <le> in acute slices, using the high-affinity <re> Ca <er>(2+) indicator fura-2 or the low-affinity dye fura-FF. Single APs evoked dendritic <re> Ca <er>(2+) transients with small amplitude. Bursts of APs evoked <re> Ca <er>(2+) transients with amplitudes that increased linearly with AP number. Analysis of <re> Ca <er>(2+) transients under steady-state conditions with different fura-2 concentrations and during loading with 200 microm fura-2 indicated that the endogenous <re> Ca <er>(2+)-binding ratio was approximately 200 (kappa(S) = 202 +/- 26 for the loading experiments). The peak amplitude of the <re> Ca <er>(2+) transients measured directly with 100 microm fura-FF was 39 nm AP(-1). At approximately 23 degrees C, the decay time constant of the <re> Ca <er>(2+) transients was 390 ms, corresponding to an extrusion rate of approximately 600 s(-1). At 34 degrees C, the decay time constant was 203 ms and the corresponding extrusion rate was approximately 1100 s(-1). At both temperatures, continuous theta-burst activity with three to five APs per theta cycle, as occurs in vivo during exploration, led to a moderate increase in the global <re> Ca <er>(2+) concentration that was proportional to AP number, whereas more intense stimulation was required to reach micromolar <re> Ca <er>(2+) concentrations and to shift <re> Ca <er>(2+) signalling into a non-linear regime. 
We have recently demonstrated that relaxin (RLX) acts as compensatory mediator in human heart failure. RLX inhibits the stimulation of endothelin-1, the most potent vasoconstrictor in heart failure. Upregulation of the endothelin type-B receptor (ET(B)), which mediates endothelin-1 clearance and endothelial release of NO, represents a pivotal mode of RLX action. However, signal transduction and abundance of this phenomenon are unknown. Therefore, we investigated RLX-induced regulation of ET(B) in human umbilical vein endothelial, epithelial (HeLa), and vascular smooth muscle cells. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells and HeLa cells, but not in human vascular smooth muscle cells, RLX upregulated ET(B) expression and activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK-1/2) and nuclear factor-kappaB (<re> NF-kappaB <er>), a transcription factor. PD-98059, a selective inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1 (MEK-1)-ERK-1/2 pathway, abolished ERK-1/2 and <re> NF-kappaB <er> activation and ET(B) upregulation. <re> NF-kappaB <er> inhibition also prevented RLX-mediated ET(B) stimulation. In <re> NF-kappaB <er>-luciferase reporter assays, we demonstrated complete inhibition of RLX-induced <re> NF-kappaB <er> activation in cells transfected with dominant-negative Raf-1, MEK-1, or ERK-1/2 constructs, whereas dominant-negative <el> Ras <le> had no effect. In rat aorta and mesenteric artery, RLX pretreatment, in an ET(B)-dependent fashion, mitigated the maximum contractile response to endothelin-1, by 38+/-4% and 43+/-6%, and the endothelin-1 sensitivity (-log[EC(50)]: aorta, 8.2+/-0.2 for vehicle versus 7.2+/-0.2 for RLX; mesenteric artery, 8.0+/-0.2 for vehicle versus 7.1+/-0.1 for RLX). RLX pretreatment augmented the dilator effect of the ET(B) agonist endothelin-3 by 100+/-8% and 133+/-13%. 
We examined the hypothesis that estradiol (E2) would affect fetal anterior pituitary corticotroph and lactotroph function in vitro, and that any effects would be influenced by <re> gestation <er>al age. Anterior pituitary cells from fetal sheep at day 129 (n = 4) and at day 139 (n = 5) of <re> gestation <er> were cultured. After 96 h in culture, cells were treated for 18 h with E2 concentrations ranging from 0 to 1000 nM, in the presence or absence of 100 nM of corticotropin-releasing hormone (<el> CRH <le>), cortisol, arginine vasopressin (AVP), or <el> CRH <le> and cortisol, to examine their effects on corticotroph function. Cells were also treated with bromocriptine or increasing concentrations of E2 to study their effects on lactotroph function. Immunoreactive (ir) adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and prolactin in the culture medium were measured by radioimmunoassay. Levels of cellular pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA and prolactin mRNA were determined by in situ hybridization. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the percentage of cells that were immunopositive for ACTH (corticotrophs) or prolactin (lactotrophs). ACTH output was stimulated by <el> CRH <le> treatment at day 139 but not at day 129 of <re> gestation <er>, and cortisol attenuated this response. ACTH output by cells cultured with 10 nM E2 and 100 nM <el> CRH <le>, at 139 days of <re> gestation <er>, was greater than with <el> CRH <le> alone (p < 0.05). E2 did not affect basal ACTH output or ACTH output with any other treatment or levels of POMC mRNA. Prolactin output was not affected by E2 treatment. Bromocriptine significantly decreased prolactin output but not levels of prolactin mRNA. 
The excessive release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can result in the development of chronic inflammation. The mechanisms involved in inflammation are various, with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress known to be among them. We have previously shown that black ginseng (<el> BG <le>) reduced lipid accumulation in and enhanced the antioxidant function of the liver in vitro and in vivo mostly due to ginsenoside Rb1, Rg3 and Rk1 components. Therefore, this study investigated the antioxidant effect of <el> BG <le> on the intestines and its possible mechanistic pathway through ER stress. The results showed that <el> BG <le> extract decreased ROS and nitric oxide (<re> NO <er>) production and reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression levels in vitro, and these results were confirmed by zebrafish embryos in vivo. However, this phenotype was abolished in the absence of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1α) but not in the absence of protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER-resistant kinase (PERK) or X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) in the mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) knockout (KO) cells, suggesting that <el> BG <le> elicits an antioxidant effect in an IRE1α-dependent manner. Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects were assessed in the liver and intestines of the mouse model affected by nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which was induced by a high-fat/high-fructose diet. In the liver, <el> BG <le> treatment rescued NAFLD-induced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-6 expression. In the intestines, <el> BG <le> also rescued NAFLD-induced shortened villi, inflammatory immune cell infiltration, upregulated IL-6, cytosine-cytosine-adenosine-adenosine-thymidine (CCAAT)/enhancer-binding homologous protein (CHOP) and binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) expression. 
Formation of methanethiol from methionine is widely believed to play a significant role in development of cheddar cheese flavor. However, the <re> catabolism <er> of methionine by cheese-related microorganisms has not been well characterized. Two independent methionine catabolic pathways are believed to be present in lactococci, one initiated by a lyase and the other initiated by an <el> aminotransferase <le>. To differentiate between these two pathways and to determine the possible distribution between the pathways, 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) performed with uniformly enriched [13C]methionine was utilized. The <re> catabolism <er> of methionine by whole cells and cell extracts of five strains of Lactococcus lactis was examined. Only the <el> aminotransferase <le>-initiated pathway was observed. The intermediate and major end products were determined to be 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyric acid and 2-hydroxyl-4-methylthiobutyric acid, respectively. Production of methanethiol was not observed in any of the 13C NMR studies. Gas chromatography was utilized to determine if the products of methionine <re> catabolism <er> in the <el> aminotransferase <le> pathway were precursors of methanethiol. The results suggest that the direct precursor of methanethiol is 4-methylthiol-2-oxobutyric acid. 
Migration of vascular smooth cells from the media to the intima essentially contributes to neointima formation after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent implantation. The stable prostacyclin mimetic <el> iloprost <le> has been shown to inhibit neointima formation in experimental restenosis, but it is currently unknown whether this may be caused by an antimigratory effect. Hence, the present study analyses (i) the influence of G(s)-coupled prostacyclin (IP) receptors on <re> cell migration <er> and (ii) verifies whether EP(3) receptors with opposite (i.e., G(i)) coupling may conversely stimulate <re> cell migration <er>. In a modified Boyden chamber model, it was shown that <el> iloprost <le> dose-dependently inhibits the migration of primary human arterial smooth muscle cells, which constitutively express the IP receptor. On the other hand, human arterial smooth muscle <re> cell migration <er> was stimulated by the EP(3) receptor agonist M&B 28.767. To independently study the effects of these receptors, IP or EP(3) receptors were stably overexpressed in chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-IP and CHO-EP(3)). Chemotaxis of CHO cells transfected with G(s)-coupled IP receptors was concentration-dependently inhibited by <el> iloprost <le> (2-100 nM), while there was no effect of <el> iloprost <le> on mock-transfected CHO. By contrast, CHO-cells that overexpressed EP(3) receptors showed a significant, concentration dependent (1-100 nM) increase of <re> cell migration <er> in presence of the selective EP(3) agonist M&B 28.767. 
The mechanism underlying the reduced <re> Cu <er> status in rats fed on a high-<el> Sn <le> diet was investigated. Male rats aged 4 weeks were fed ad lib. on purified diets containing either 1 or 100 mg <el> Sn <le>/kg and demineralized water for a period of 4 weeks. The high-<el> Sn <le> diet had no effect on feed intake, body-weight gain or weight of liver and kidney but significantly reduced <re> Cu <er> concentrations in plasma, liver and kidney. Biliary <re> Cu <er> excretion was decreased significantly in rats fed on the high-<el> Sn <le> diet. Apparent <re> Cu <er> absorption (<re> Cu <er> intake-faecal <re> Cu <er>) was not affected by the high-<el> Sn <le> diet, but the estimate of true <re> Cu <er> absorption (<re> Cu <er> intake-(faecal <re> Cu <er>-biliary <re> Cu <er>)) was significantly reduced. 
Smooth muscle of the gut undergoes rhythmic cycles of contraction and relaxation. Various constituents in the pathways that mediate muscle contraction could act to cross-regulate cAMP or cGMP levels and terminate subsequent relaxation. We have previously shown that cAMP levels are regulated by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase 3A (PDE3A) and PDE4D5; the latter is the only PDE4D isoform expressed in smooth muscle. In the present study we have elucidated a mechanism whereby cholecystokinin (CCK) and, presumably, other contractile agonists capable of activating PKC can cross-regulate cAMP levels. Forskolin stimulated <re> PDE4D5 phosphorylation <er> and PDE4D5 activity. CCK significantly increased forskolin-stimulated <re> PDE4D5 phosphorylation <er> and activity and attenuated forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels. The effect of CCK on forskolin-induced <re> PDE4D5 phosphorylation <er> and activity and on cAMP levels was blocked by the inhibitors of PLC or PKC and in cultured muscle cells by the expression of Galpha(q) minigene. The effects of CCK on <re> PDE4D5 phosphorylation <er>, PDE4D5 activity, and cAMP levels were mimicked by low (1 nM) concentrations of okadaic acid, but not by a low (10 nM) concentration of tautomycin, suggesting involvement of <el> PP2A <le>. Purified catalytic subunit of <el> PP2A <le> but not PP1 dephosphorylated PDE4D5 in vitro. Coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrated association of PDE4D5 with <el> PP2A <le> and the association was decreased by the activation of PKC. 
Islet production of nitric oxide (NO) and CO in relation to islet hormone secretion was investigated in mice given the NO synthase (<el> NOS <le>) inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) in their drinking water. In these mice, the total islet NO production was paradoxically increased, reflecting induction of inducible <el> NOS <le> (iNOS) in background of reduced activity and immunoreactivity of constitutive <el> NOS <le> (cNOS). Unexpectedly, normal mice fasted for 24 h also displayed iNOS activity, which was further increased in L-NAME-drinking mice. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vitro and in vivo was increased in fasted but unaffected in fed mice after L-NAME drinking. Glucagon secretion was increased in vitro. Control islets incubated with different <el> NOS <le> inhibitors at 20 mM glucose displayed increased <re> insulin release <er> and decreased cNOS activity. These <el> NOS <le> inhibitors potentiated glucose-stimulated <re> insulin release <er> also from islets of L-NAME-drinking mice. In contrast, glucagon release was suppressed. In islets from L-NAME-drinking mice, cyclic nucleotides were upregulated, and forskolin-stimulated hormone release, CO production, and heme oxygenase (HO)-2 expression increased. 
To understand the molecular mechanisms by which anti-p185HER2 antibody and the ligand heregulin inhibit tumor growth, we have investigated several signaling proteins and pathways. We report here that anti-p185HER2 monoclonal antibody ID5 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of HER2 in SKBr3 breast cancer cells that overexpress p185HER2. <el> Heregulin <le> beta1 induced phosphorylation of both HER3 and HER2. ID5 produced a greater association of phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma1 with HER2 than did heregulin. Concordantly, ID5, but not heregulin, increased PLC-gamma1 activity. However, the G1 cell cycle arrest and induction of p27Kip1 produced by ID5 were not affected by the inhibition of PLC-gamma. ID5 preferentially induced binding of the Mr 46,000 isoform of SHC to HER2, whereas heregulin preferentially induced binding of the Mr 52,00 isoform of SHC to HER3. <el> Heregulin <le>, but not ID5, induced the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3-K) to interact with HER3. <el> Heregulin <le> induced sustained activation of P13-K signaling, whereas ID5 had only a transient effect. <el> Heregulin <le>, but not ID5, activated the c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase cascade. Pretreatment of SKBr3 cells with ID5 decreased heregulin-induced association of HER2 with HER3 as well as the activation of c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase and PI3-K activities. Inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in SKBr3 cells did not affect heregulin-induced G2-M-phase arrest, apoptosis, and <re> differentiation <er>. 
Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) and zipper-interacting protein kinase (<re> ZIPK <er>) have been implicated in diverse physiological functions. <el> ROCK1 <le> phosphorylates and activates <re> ZIPK <er> suggesting that at least some of these physiological functions may require both enzymes. To test the hypothesis that sequential activation of <el> ROCK1 <le> and <re> ZIPK <er> is commonly involved in regulatory pathways, we utilized siRNA to knock down <el> ROCK1 <le> and <re> ZIPK <er> in cultured human arterial smooth muscle cells (SMC). Microarray analysis using a whole-transcript expression chip identified changes in gene expression induced by <el> ROCK1 <le> and <re> ZIPK <er> knockdown. <el> ROCK1 <le> knockdown affected the expression of 553 genes, while <re> ZIPK <er> knockdown affected the expression of 390 genes. A high incidence of regulation of transcription regulator genes was observed in both knockdowns. Other affected groups included transporters, kinases, peptidases, transmembrane and G protein-coupled receptors, growth factors, phosphatases and ion channels. Only 76 differentially expressed genes were common to <el> ROCK1 <le> and <re> ZIPK <er> knockdown. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified five pathways shared between the two knockdowns. We focused on cytokine signaling pathways since <el> ROCK1 <le> knockdown up-regulated 5 and down-regulated 4 cytokine genes, in contrast to <re> ZIPK <er> knockdown, which affected the expression of only two cytokine genes (both down-regulated). IL-6 gene expression and secretion of IL-6 protein were up-regulated by <el> ROCK1 <le> knockdown, whereas <re> ZIPK <er> knockdown reduced IL-6 mRNA expression and IL-6 protein secretion and increased <el> ROCK1 <le> protein expression, suggesting that <el> ROCK1 <le> may inhibit IL-6 secretion. IL-1β mRNA and protein levels were increased in response to <el> ROCK1 <le> knockdown. Differences in the effects of <el> ROCK1 <le> and <re> ZIPK <er> knockdown on cell cycle regulatory genes suggested that <el> ROCK1 <le> and <re> ZIPK <er> regulate the cell cycle by different mechanisms. <el> ROCK1 <le>, but not <re> ZIPK <er> knockdown reduced the viability and inhibited proliferation of vascular SMC. 
<el> <re> TAp73 <er> <le>, a member of the p53 tumor suppressor family, can substitute for p53 function, especially in p53-null and p53-mutant cells. However, <el> <re> TAp73 <er> <le> enrichment and phosphorylation change its transcriptional activity. Previously, we found that the antitumor function of <el> <re> TAp73 <er> <le> was reactivated by dephosphorylation. Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2) plays an important role in bone development. Using a biological information database and phosphorylation prediction software, we hypothesized that PLK2 phosphorylates <el> <re> TAp73 <er> <le> and inhibits <el> <re> TAp73 <er> <le> function in osteosarcomas. Actually,we determined that PLK2 physically binds to and phosphorylates <el> <re> TAp73 <er> <le> when <el> <re> TAp73 <er> <le> protein abundance is up-regulated by cisplatin. PLK2-phosphorylated <el> <re> TAp73 <er> <le> at residue Ser48 within the TA domain; phosphorylation of <el> <re> TAp73 <er> <le> was abolished by mutating this residue. Moreover, PLK2 inhibition combined with cisplatin treatment in osteosarcoma Saos2 cells up-regulated p21 and puma mRNA expression to a greater extent than cisplatin treatment alone. Inhibiting PLK2 in <el> <re> TAp73 <er> <le>-enriched Saos2 cells resulted in inhibited cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, G1 phase arrest, and decreased cell invasion. However, these changes did not occur in <el> <re> TAp73 <er> <le> knockdown Saos2 cells. 
In the present study, the actions of nitric oxide (<el> NO <le>) on NMDA mediated excitatory neurotransmission in substantia gelatinosa (<re> SG <er>) neurons of the adult rat spinal cord were investigated. Bath application of the <el> NO <le> donor sodium-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) reversibly inhibited NMDA receptor mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents evoked by electrical stimulation of the dorsal root. These effects of SNAP were prevented by pre-incubation with the <el> NO <le> scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (carboxy PTIO) or the guanylate cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-alpha]quinoxalin-1-one, and were mimicked by the membrane permeable cGMP analogue dibutyryl cGMP. Finally, these effects were shown to be mediated at a postsynaptic level using acutely applied exogenous NMDA. 
Neuronal death is a pathophysiological process that is often caused by hypoxia/ischemia. However, the causes of hypoxia/ischemia-induced neuronal death are debated, and additional experimental data are needed to resolve this debate. In the present study, we applied oxygen-glucose deprivation (<el> OGD <le>) to PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons to establish a hypoxia/ischemia model. We evaluated the effects of <el> OGD <le> on cell death/apoptosis and on the levels of two excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters, aspartic acid and glutamic acid, in both hippocampal neurons and the medium used to culture the hippocampal neurons. We also evaluated GluR2 expression in hippocampal neurons as well as the effects of <el> OGD <le> on whole-cell potassium currents in PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons. Our experimental results showed that <el> OGD <le> significantly decreased cell viability and markedly enhanced apoptosis in PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons. <el> OGD <le> treatment for 3 h increased the levels of Asp and Glu in the medium used to culture hippocampal neurons, but decreased both the levels of Asp and Glu and GluR2 expression in hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, <el> OGD <le> altered the electrophysiological properties of <re> voltage <er>-dependent potassium channels in PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons in different ways; <el> OGD <le> decreased the <re> voltage <er>-dependent potassium current in PC12 cells, but increased this current in hippocampal neurons. 
Sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, is a newly developed oral hypoglycemic agent. Sitagliptin increases the level of glucagon-like polypeptide (GLP)-1 that increases insulin secretion. In addition, GLP-1 decreases salt intake and increases urinary salt excretion. Therefore, the <el> sitagliptin <le> treatment might lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes. It also remains to be examined whether the reduction in blood pressure with <el> sitagliptin <le> treatment is related to the blood glucose improvement and the body weight decrease. To identify beneficial effects of <el> sitagliptin <le> treatment, we administered <el> sitagliptin <le> (50 mg) on alternate days to seventeen type 2 diabetes outpatients with insufficient blood glucose control (8 males and 9 females; mean age of 67.1 years). The patients were also treated with oral hypoglycemic agents and antihypertensive drugs for six months before and during the <el> sitagliptin <le> administration. We measured the level of hemoglobin (Hb) A1c, systolic blood pressure (<re> SBP <er>), and body mass index (BMI) for up to six months thereafter. Their BMIs remained unchanged. The levels of HbA1c were dropped from 6.5 ± 0.3% to 5.8 ± 0.3%, while <re> SBP <er> was also dropped from 130.0 ± 37.2 mmHg to 119.7 ± 9.4 mmHg. However, the degree of the decrease in HbA1c levels was not significantly correlated with that of <re> SBP <er> (r = 0.24). 
The study describes a reproducible model of complete brain ischemia in rats. Rats with different plasma glucose concentrations were exposed to 10 min of complete cerebral ischemia achieved by compression of neck vessels by a pneumatic cuff. All 30 rats, except one, in which pre-ischemic plasma glucose level were lower than 22 mM (range 1.6-22) survived 10 min complete ischemia and made a similar recovery. Ten rats with pre-ischemic plasma glucose levels above 22 mM (range 22-47.2) died from <re> seizures <er> in the post-ischemic period. Post-ischemic treatment of <re> seizures <er> and <el> hyperglycemia <le> in the hyperglycemic rats significantly improved recovery. 
The acetyl moiety in aspirin (acetyl salicylic acid: <el> ASA <le>) is considered to play a major part in the pathogenesis of <el> ASA <le>-induced mucosal injury. At equivalent <re> salicylate <er> doses and pH values, the induction of acute gastric mucosal haemorrhagic erosions in rats by <el> ASA <le> and choline magnesium trisalicylate (CMT), a new non-acetylated <re> salicylate <er>, with and without the potentiating damaging effect of taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) were compared. Test solutions were administered by per oral intubation to five groups of fasting Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 24). Gastric mucosa were examined after 4 hours and mucosal injury assessed by a lesion-scoring system. The incidence and severity (median lesion scores with quartiles) of the lesions were 83% and 13 (7:20) respectively for <el> ASA <le> (128 mg kg-1) compared with 17% and 0 (0:0) for CMT (128 mg kg-1) (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.001). TDCA increased mucosal damage to 100% and 29 (20:34) for <el> ASA <le> compared with 30% and 0 (0:4) for CMT (P less than 0.001) and P less than 0.001). Serum <re> salicylate <er> levels (median values of 1.4 for <el> ASA <le> and 1.5 mmol litre-1 for CMT) were not significantly different. 
Temozolomide (TMZ) has been widely used in the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM), although inherent or acquired resistance restricts the application. This study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of sulforaphane (SFN) to <re> TMZ-induced apoptosis <er> in GBM cells and the potential mechanism. Biochemical assays and subcutaneous tumor establishment were used to characterize the function of SFN in <re> TMZ-induced apoptosis <er>. Our results revealed that β-catenin and <el> miR-21 <le> were concordantly expressed in GBM cell lines, and SFN significantly reduced <el> miR-21 <le> expression through inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin/TCF4 pathway. Furthermore, down-regulation of <el> miR-21 <le> enhanced the pro-apoptotic efficacy of TMZ in GBM cells. Finally, we observed that SFN strengthened TMZ-mediated apoptosis in a <el> miR-21 <le>-dependent manner. 
Systemic <el> progesterone <le> affects the timing and duration of uterine endometrial gene and protein expression and has significant effects on conceptus development. The objective of the present study was to examine how changes in <el> progesterone <le> concentrations during the early luteal phase affect retinol-binding protein (<re> RBP4 <er>) mRNA and protein concentrations in the uterus. Endometrial tissue and uterine flushings were recovered on Days 7 and 13 of the oestrous cycle in heifers with high, normal and low <el> progesterone <le> concentrations. <re> RBP4 <er> mRNA and protein concentrations were higher (P<0.05) on Day 13 compared with Day 7 in heifers with high and control <el> progesterone <le> concentrations. However, there was no difference in <re> RBP4 <er> protein concentrations between Days 7 and 13 in heifers with low <el> progesterone <le> (P>0.05). On Day 7, although heifers with low <el> progesterone <le> had lower <re> RBP4 <er> mRNA expression compared with controls (P<0.05) there was no difference in protein concentrations between treatment groups. On Day 13, <re> RBP4 <er> mRNA was 2-fold higher (P<0.001) in heifers with high and control <el> progesterone <le> compared with their low-<el> progesterone <le> counterparts and <re> RBP4 <er> protein concentrations were over 2-fold higher (P<0.001) in heifers with high compared to low <el> progesterone <le>. 
Neural circuits are shaped by activity-dependent elimination of redundant synapses during postnatal development. In many systems, postsynaptic activity is known to be crucial, but the precise mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we report that the immediate early gene <el> Arc <le>/Arg3.1 mediates elimination of surplus climbing fiber (<re> CF <er>) to Purkinje cell (PC) synapses in the developing cerebellum. <re> CF <er> synapse elimination was accelerated when activity of channelrhodopsin-2-expressing PCs was elevated by 2-day photostimulation. This acceleration was suppressed by PC-specific knockdown of either the P/Q-type voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels (VDCCs) or <el> Arc <le>. PC-specific <el> Arc <le> knockdown had no appreciable effect until around postnatal day 11 but significantly impaired <re> CF <er> synapse elimination thereafter, leaving redundant <re> CF <er> terminals on PC somata. The effect of <el> Arc <le> knockdown was occluded by simultaneous knockdown of P/Q-type VDCCs in PCs. 
Previous studies in our laboratory indicated gender differences in salinity-enhanced acute toxicity of <re> aldicarb <er> in Japanese medaka with females being more susceptible. In the current study, the effects of the sex steroids, 17beta estradiol (<el> E2 <le>) and testosterone (T) on <re> aldicarb <er> toxicity was examined. Adult Japanese medaka were separated by sex and exposed to 100 microg/l <el> E2 <le> or T for 6 days followed by exposure to the 96-h LC50 (0.5 mg/l) of <re> aldicarb <er>. The toxicity of <re> aldicarb <er> to adult males was significantly lowered by <el> E2 <le> and T whereby the mortality percentage was reduced to 23.3 +/- 5.8% and 3.3 +/- 5.8%, respectively, compared to the fish not receiving steroids (46.7 +/- 5.8% mortality). In females, T caused significant reduction in <re> aldicarb <er> toxicity to 16.7 +/- 5.8%, while <el> E2 <le> significantly enhanced the toxicity to 96.7 +/- 5.8% mortality. Since the flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) enzyme system had been shown to play a critical role in <re> aldicarb <er> toxicity, the effect of <el> E2 <le> and T on FMO expression was examined. Gill FMO activity showed a direct correlation with the overall toxicity of <re> aldicarb <er> in both male and female medaka. Expression of FMO1-like protein was significantly reduced by T in male livers and gills, and T did not affect the expression of FMOs in female tissues. In contrast, <el> E2 <le> significantly reduced FMO1-like protein expression in male gills and female livers, as well as FMO3 expression in both male and female livers, but significantly increased gill FMO1 expression in females. Since <re> aldicarb <er> acts by inhibiting the enzyme cholinesterase (ChE), the effect of sex hormones on the activity of this enzyme was also examined. In both male and female medaka, T counteracted the inhibitory effect of <re> aldicarb <er> on muscle ChE. In male fish, <el> E2 <le> had similar effects but did not seem to counteract the ChE inhibition in females. 
Autophagy is an innate immune defense against bacterial invasion. Recent studies show that two adaptor proteins, <el> p62 <le> and NDP52, are required for <re> autophagy <er> of the bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium). However, it is not known why two different adaptors are required to target the same bacterial cargo to <re> autophagy <er>. Here we show that both adaptors are recruited to bacteria with similar kinetics, that they are recruited to bacteria independently of each other, and that depletion of either adaptor leads to impairment of antibacterial <re> autophagy <er>. Depletion of both adaptors does not synergistically impair <re> autophagy <er>, indicating they act in the same pathway. Remarkably, we observed that these adaptors do not colocalize, but rather form non-overlapping microdomains surrounding bacteria. 
Paclitaxel and vincristine are chemotherapeutic drugs that often evoke a long-lasting <re> pain <er>ful peripheral neuropathy. Using drugs that reduce intracellular or extracellular calcium ions (Ca2+), we investigated the hypothesis that impaired Ca2+ regulation contributes to the chemotherapy-evoked neuropathic <re> pain <er> syndrome. For comparison, we also tested rats with <re> pain <er>ful peripheral neuropathy caused by nerve trauma and to the anti-human immunodeficiency virus nucleoside analog 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC). Normal naïve (without neuropathy), <el> paclitaxel <le>-treated, and vincristine-treated rats received the following intrathecal injections: TMB-8 (46 nmol), Quin-2 (1.8 nmol), EGTA (0.1 micromol), EGTA-am (0.1 micromol), and their vehicle controls. Chronic constriction injury (CCI) rats were examined after TMB-8 and Quin-2 injections, and ddC-treated rats were examined after receiving TMB-8. Mechano-allodynia and mechano-hyperalgesia were evaluated after each injection. Drug effects on heat hyperalgesia were also tested in CCI rats. All four Ca2+-reducing drugs significantly inhibited mechano-allodynia and mechano-hyperalgesia in the rats treated with <el> paclitaxel <le>, vincristine, or ddC, but no effects were seen in the CCI or naïve rats. 
Breast cancer patients with HER-2 positive or estrogen receptor negative tumors have a poor prognosis because these tumors are aggressive and respond poorly to standard therapies. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been shown to decreased cell survival, which suggests that HDAC inhibitors may be developed for preventing and treating breast cancer. Curcumin has anti-inflammatory and proapoptotic effects in cancer cells. We determined whether the HDAC inhibitor, Tricostatin A (<re> TSA <er>) in combination with curcumin would produce greater antiproliferative and apoptotic effects than either agent alone. Increasing the concentration of curcumin from 10 to 20 µM enhanced the growth inhibitory effects of the combination in SkBr3 and 435eB breast cancer cells, which was accompanied by decreased viability along with decreased phosphorylation of ERK and Akt. The decreased cell viability observed in SkBr3 cells when curcumin was combined with <re> TSA <er> led to a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and increased p21 and p27, and decreased Cyclin D1 protein expression. The combination induced cleavage of caspase 3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, suggesting that cell death occurred by apoptosis. There were no changes in protein expression of Bcl2, Bax, or Bcl-xL and decreased expression of <el> p53 <le>. The combination increased protein expression of phosphorylated JNK and phosphorylated p38. Pharmacological inhibition of JNK, but not p38, attenuated the decreased viability induced by the curcumin and <re> TSA <er> combination. 
The purpose of this study was to determine whether suffusion of <el> L-arginine <le> alone induces <re> vasodilation <er> in the cheek pouch of hamsters with hereditary cardiomyopathy in comparison with controls, and whether these effects are mediated by the <el> L-arginine <le>/nitric oxide biosynthetic pathway. Using intravital microscopy, we found that suffusion of <el> L-arginine <le> for 20 minutes induced a significant, stereospecific concentration-dependent <re> vasodilation <er> in hamsters with hereditary cardiomyopathy but not in controls (p < 0.05). These responses were abrogated by suffusion of the nitric synthase inhibitor NG-<el> L-arginine <le> methyl ester (L-NAME) but not by suffusion of D-NAME. Suffusion of nitroglycerin, a nitric oxide donor, induced significant <re> vasodilation <er> of similar magnitude in both groups (p < 0.05). L-NAME had no significant effects on nitroglycerin-induced responses in both groups. 
Prostacyclin and the prostacyclin receptor (IP) are implicated in mediating many of the atheroprotective effects of <re> estrogen <er> in both humans and in animal models but through unknown mechanisms. Hence, herein the influence of <re> estrogen <er> on IP gene expression in endothelial EA.hy926, human erythroleukemia 92.1.7 and primary human aortic smooth muscle cells was investigated. Estrogen increased <el> hIP <le> mRNA levels, promoter (PrmIP)-directed reporter gene expression and cicaprost-dependent cAMP generation in all cell types, effects that were abrogated by actinomycin D and the general <re> estrogen <er> receptor (ER)-alpha/ERbeta antagonist ICI 182,780. Furthermore, the ERalpha-selective agonist 4,4',4''-(4-propyl-[1H]-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl)trisphenol (PPT), but not the ERbeta-agonist 2,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile, significantly increased <el> hIP <le> mRNA and PrmIP-directed gene expression. Deletional and mutational analysis of PrmIP uncovered an evolutionary conserved <re> estrogen <er>-response element, while electrophoretic mobility shift, antibody-supershift and chromatin immunoprecipitations assays confirmed the direct binding of ERalpha, but not ERbeta, to PrmIP both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, immunofluorescence microscopy corroborated that <re> estrogen <er> and PPT increased <el> hIP <le> expression in primary human aortic smooth muscle cells. 
The synthesis of dopamine and serotonin in rat brain striatal synaptosomes has been studied by direct measurement of dopamine and serotonin by HPLC employing electrochemical detection. In both cases the presence of dibutyryl <el> cyclic AMP <le> stimulated the rate of synthesis and this effect was prolonged in the presence of theophylline. Theophylline alone had no effect. The stimulating effect of 1 mM dibutyryl <el> cyclic AMP <le> on dopamine synthesis was prevented by 1 mM EDTA but not by NaF. EDTA alone did not effect dopamine synthesis but 20 mM NaF alone caused a marked stimulation (increase of 33%) comparable to that produced by 1 mM dibutyryl <el> cyclic AMP <le>. In contrast 1 mM EGTA caused a marked inhibition (30% decrease) of the synthesis of dopamine in this system. The stimulation of <re> serotonin synthesis <er> by 1 mM dibutyryl <el> cyclic AMP <le> was inhibited by 1 mM EDTA and 20 mM NaF. In contrast to dopamine synthesis, <re> serotonin synthesis <er> was markedly inhibited (40%) by 1 mM EDTA on its own, but not affected by 20 mM NaF. However, 1 mM EGTA caused a similar inhibition of <re> serotonin synthesis <er> to that of dopamine synthesis. Exogenously added noradrenaline, adrenaline and serotonin (1-100 ?M) markedly inhibited dopamine synthesis in a non linear fashion as did noradrenaline and adrenaline on <re> serotonin synthesis <er>. The addition of imipramine together with noradrenaline rendered the noradrenaline inhibition of both dopamine and <re> serotonin synthesis <er> less effective. The results are discussed with respect to the mechanisms of feed back inhibition of dopamine and <re> serotonin synthesis <er> by products and the stimulation of their synthesis by <el> cyclic AMP <le> linked systems. 
22Na+ uptake into confluent monolayers of cultured bovine corneal endothelial cells was studied in the presence of ouabain (10(-4)M) to inhibit active <re> sodium <er> extrusion. In bicarbonate saline, uptake was reduced to a similar degree either by amiloride (10(-3)M) or by 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (SITS) (10(-3)M). A further reduction was obtained with SITS-pretreated cells in the presence of amiloride. SITS-sensitive uptake was further characterized in saline containing both ouabain (10(-4)M) and amiloride (10(-3)M). It was absolutely dependent on bicarbonate, which could not be substituted by other plasma membrane permeable buffers (50 mM acetate or 25 mM glycodiazine). It was a saturable function of both bicarbonate and <re> sodium <er> concentration. Half-maximal fluxes occurred between 3 and 7 mM HCO3 (at 151 mM <el> Na <le>) and between 35 and 60 mM <el> Na <le> (at 28 mM HCO3). Uptake into <re> sodium <er>-depleted cells was reduced as opposed to <re> sodium <er>-rich cells, and SITS-sensitive 22Na+ efflux out of 22Na+-loaded cells into <re> sodium <er>-free medium was less than efflux into <re> sodium <er> saline, indicating trans-stimulation by <re> sodium <er>. The amiloride-sensitive pathway was studied in the absence of bicarbonate to inhibit uptake via the SITS-sensitive pathway. 22Na+ uptake into <re> sodium <er>-depleted cells increased steeply with extracellular pH in the range between pH 6 and 8 and could be largely blocked by 10(-3), but not by 10(-5) M amiloride. 
The N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR), a G protein-coupled receptor that binds proinflammatory chemoattractant peptides, serves as a model receptor for leukocyte chemotaxis. Recombinant histidine-tagged FPR (rHis-FPR) was purified in lysophosphatidyl glycerol (LPG) by Ni(2+)-NTA agarose chromatography to >95% purity with high yield. MALDI-TOF mass analysis (>36% sequence coverage) and immunoblotting confirmed the identity as FPR. The rHis-FPR served as an immunogen for the production of 2 mAbs, NFPR1 and NFPR2, that epitope map to the FPR C-terminal tail sequences, 305-GQDFRERLI-313 and 337-NSTLPSAEVE-346, respectively. Both mAbs specifically immunoblotted rHis-FPR and recombinant FPR (<re> rFPR <er>) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. NFPR1 also recognized recombinant FPRL1, specifically expressed in mouse L fibroblasts. In human neutrophil membranes, both Abs labeled a 45-75 kDa species (peak M(r) approximately 60 kDa) localized primarily in the plasma membrane with a minor component in the lactoferrin-enriched intracellular fractions, consistent with FPR size and localization. NFPR1 also recognized a band of M(r) approximately 40 kDa localized, in equal proportions to the plasma membrane and lactoferrin-enriched fractions, consistent with FPRL1 size and localization. Only NFPR2 was capable of immunoprecipitation of <re> rFPR <er> in detergent extracts. The recognition of <re> rFPR <er> by NFPR2 is lost after exposure of cellular <re> rFPR <er> to f-Met-Leu-Phe (<el> fMLF <le>) and regained after alkaline phosphatase treatment of <re> rFPR <er>-bearing membranes. In neutrophils, NFPR2 immunofluorescence was lost upon <el> fMLF <le> stimulation. Immunoblotting approximately 60 kDa species, after phosphatase treatment of <el> fMLF <le>-stimulated neutrophil membranes, was also enhanced. 
The present study evaluated the mechanism by which protein synthesis inhibitors activate bovine oocytes. The aim was to analyze the dynamics of MPF and MAPKs. MII oocytes were activated with ionomycin (Io), ionomycin+anisomycin (ANY) and ionomycin+cycloheximide (CHX) and by in vitro fertilization (IVF). The expression of <re> cyclin B1 <er>, p-<el> CDK1 <le>, p-ERK1/2, p-JNK and p-P38 were evaluated by immunodetection and the kinase activity of ERK1/2 was measured by enzyme assay. Evaluations at 1, 4 and 15 hours, post-activation (hpa) showed that the expression of <re> cyclin B1 <er> was not modified by the treatments. ANY inactivated MPF by p-<el> CDK1 <le>Thr14-Tyr15 at 4 hpa (p < 0.05), CHX increased pre-MPF (p-<el> CDK1 <le>Thr161 and p-<el> CDK1 <le>Thr14-Tyr15) at 1 hpa and IVF increased p-<el> CDK1 <le>Thr14-Tyr15 at 17 hpf (p < 0.05). ANY and CHX reduced the levels of p-ERK1/2 at 4 hpa (p < 0.05) and its activity at 4 and 1 hpa, respectively (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, IVF increased p-ERK1/2 at 6 hpf (p < 0.05); however, its kinase activity decreased at 6 hpf (p < 0.05). p-JNK in ANY, CHX and IVF oocytes decreased at 4 hpa (p < 0.05). p-P38 was only observed at 1 hpa, with no differences between treatments. 
Galectin-3 is a β-galactoside-binding animal lectin with diverse functions, including regulation of T helper (Th) 1 and Th2 responses. Current data indicate that <el> galectin-3 <le> expressed in dendritic cells (<re> DC <er>s) may be contributory. Th17 cells have emerged as critical inducers of tissue inflammation in autoimmune disease and important mediators of host defense against fungal pathogens, although little is known about <el> galectin-3 <le> involvement in Th17 development. We investigated the role of <el> galectin-3 <le> in the induction of Th17 immunity in <el> galectin-3 <le>-deficient (gal3(-/-)) and gal3(+/+) mouse bone marrow-derived <re> DC <er>s. We demonstrate that intracellular <el> galectin-3 <le> negatively regulates Th17 polarization in response to the dectin-1 agonist curdlan (a β-glucan present on the cell wall of fungal species) and lipopolysaccharide, agents that prime <re> DC <er>s for Th17 differentiation. On activation of dectin-1, gal3(-/-) <re> DC <er>s secreted higher levels of the Th17-axis cytokine IL-23 compared with gal3(+/+) <re> DC <er>s and contained higher levels of activated c-Rel, an NF-κB subunit that promotes IL-23 expression. Levels of active Raf-1, a kinase that participates in downstream inhibition of c-Rel binding to the IL23A promoter, were impaired in gal3(-/-) <re> DC <er>s. Modulation of Th17 by <el> galectin-3 <le> in <re> DC <er>s also occurred in vivo because adoptive transfer of gal3(-/-) <re> DC <er>s exposed to Candida albicans conferred higher Th17 responses and protection against fungal infection. 
Galectin 1 (<el> Gal-1 <le>), a lactose-binding lectin, is a component of vascular extracellular matrix and secreted by human vascular smooth muscle cells (<re> SMC <er>s). The purpose of this study was to investigate a possible role of <el> Gal-1 <le> in controlling adhesion and migration of cultured human vascular <re> SMC <er>s. <el> Gal-1 <le> co-localised with laminin and cellular fibronectin in extracellular matrix (ECM) secreted by cultured human vascular <re> SMC <er>s. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-<el> Gal-1 <le> fusion protein bound to laminin and cellular fibronectin in ELISA. GST-<el> Gal-1 <le> inhibited <re> SMC <er> attachment to laminin via interactions with both <re> SMC <er>s and laminin. GST-<el> Gal-1 <le> inhibited <re> SMC <er> spreading on plastic or on laminin, but not on cellular fibronectin. GST-<el> Gal-1 <le> modulated <re> SMC <er> migration on laminin and inhibited migration on cellular fibronectin. GST-<el> Gal-1 <le> bound to several 35S-labelled proteins in <re> SMC <er> extracts including laminin and alpha1beta1 integrin, identified by depletion of <re> SMC <er> protein extracts with respective antibodies. 
Cytokines such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) stimulate inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and nitric oxide overproduction leading to beta-cell damage. Meanwhile, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and its potent analog exendin-4 (<el> EX-4 <le>) were well known for beta-cell proliferation. However, the protective mechanisms of GLP-1 in beta-cells exposed to cytokines were not fully elucidated. Therefore, the effects of <el> EX-4 <le> on the IL-1beta-induced iNOS gene expression were investigated employing RINm5F beta-cells. <el> EX-4 <le> inhibited IL-1beta-induced iNOS protein expression and nitrite production. However, northern blot and promoter analyses showed that <el> EX-4 <le> failed to inhibit IL-1beta-induced iNOS mRNA expression and iNOS promoter activity. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), <el> EX-4 <le> did not alter the binding activity of NF-kappaB to the iNOS promoter. Consistent with the EMSA result, <el> EX-4 <le> did not inhibit nuclear translocation of p65. We also tested the effect of <el> EX-4 <le> on iNOS mRNA stability. Actinomycin D chase experiments showed that <el> EX-4 <le> did not affect the decay rate of iNOS mRNA and the promoter assay using the construct containing 3'-untranslated region of iNOS showed that <el> EX-4 <le> did not alter the stability of iNOS mRNA. Meanwhile, forskolin significantly inhibited IL-1beta-induced iNOS protein, which was reversed by H-89, a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor. Moreover, <el> EX-4 <le> pretreatment restored IL-1beta-induced decrease in <re> cAMP <er> toward control level. Additionally, the cycloheximide chase study demonstrated that <el> EX-4 <le> significantly accelerated iNOS protein degradation. 
This study examined whether the cytokine interferon (IFN) gamma plays a role in the injury of SH-SY5Y cells caused by <el> MPP <le>(+) (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium). First of all, IFN-gamma sensitized cells to the neurotoxin <el> MPP <le>(+), as determined by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-y1)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. <el> MPP <le>(+)-injured cells showed higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, which was reinforced by IFN-gamma. The injury triggered a marked expression of the neuronal NOS (nNOS) enzyme. L-NAME [N(ω)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a non-specific NOS inhibitor] reestablished the cell viability after IFN-gamma challenging, and recovered cells from <el> MPP <le>(+) injury (95.0 vs. 84.7 %; P < 0.05). Seven-NI (7-nitroindazole, a nNOS inhibitor) protected cells against the injury by <el> MPP <le>(+) co-administered with IFN-gamma. Both inhibitors restrained the apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells caused by <el> MPP <le>(+)/IFN-gamma. Regarding oxidative stress, L-NAME and 7-NI attenuated the increase in <re> ROS levels <er> caused by <el> MPP <le>(+) (45.3 or 48.4 vs. 87.9 %, P < 0.05). Indeed, L-NAME was more effective than 7-NI for reducing oxidative stress caused by <el> MPP <le>(+) under IFN-gamma exposition. The nNOS gene silencing by small-interfering RNAs recovered cells challenged by IFN-gamma (24 h), or <el> MPP <le>(+) (8 h). 
Long non-coding (lnc)RNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 12 (<el> SNHG12 <le>) has an oncogenic role in various common human cancer types, including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the detailed regulatory mechanisms of <el> SNHG12 <le> in CRC cells have remained largely elusive, and the investigation thereof was the purpose of the present study. Polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to examine the expression of lncRNA and microRNA (miR). Cell Counting Kit-8 and Transwell assays were used to assess cell proliferation and <re> invasion <er>. A luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm a predicted targeting association between lncRNA and miR. It was observed that <el> SNHG12 <le> was markedly upregulated in CRC tissues when compared with that in adjacent non-tumour tissues, and its high expression was associated with CRC progression, as well as poor prognosis of patients. In addition, the expression of <el> SNHG12 <le> was higher in CRC cell lines when compared with that in a normal intestinal epithelial cell line. Knockdown of <el> SNHG12 <le> significantly inhibited CRC cell proliferation and <re> invasion <er>, while ectopic overexpression of <el> SNHG12 <le> had the opposite effect. A Bioinformatics analysis predicted that <el> SNHG12 <le> and miR-16 have complementary binding sites, which was confirmed by a luciferase reporter gene assay. The expression levels of miR-16 were markedly decreased in CRC tissues and cell lines compared with those in normal tissues or cells, and were inversely correlated with the expression levels of <el> SNHG12 <le> in CRC tissues. Furthermore, silencing of miR-16 eliminated the suppressive effects of <el> SNHG12 <le> knockdown on CRC cell proliferation and <re> invasion <er>. 
7-Hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01) is a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes alpha, beta, and gamma [Seynaeve et al., Mol. Pharmacol, 45: 1207-1214, 1994] that also has antitumor effects in vivo. To determine whether inhibition of PKC can be related to inhibition of <re> cell growth <er> with induction of apoptosis, we compared the effects of UCN-01 to those of the highly selective bisindolylmaleimide PKC antagonist GF 109203X in leukemic T-cell lines. Both compounds potently inhibited PKC activity when added to T-cell membrane preparations and reversed phorbol ester-induced c-fos gene expression in intact cells. However, whereas UCN-01 potently inhibited growth of Jurkat, Molt-3, Molt-4, and Hut-78 cells (IC50 = 20-65 nM, irreversible after 24 h of exposure), GF 109203X had IC50s for <re> cell growth <er> of 3.6-5.0 muM. Less than 3 h after addition, UCN-01 but not GF 109203X-treated cells displayed loss of cells with G2-M DNA content, appearance of a hypodiploid DNA fraction, and evidence of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Six h after treatment, cells appeared to accumulate with S-phase DNA content. These effects correlated with selective UCN-01 but not GF 109203X-induced decrease in total and tyrosine phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinases (<el> cdk <le>s) 1 and 2, and with increases in the histone H1 kinase activities of <el> cdk <le>1 and <el> cdk <le>2. UCN-01 was relatively less potent in inhibition of properly activated <el> cdk <le>1 and <el> cdk <le>2 when added in vitro to H1 kinase assays (IC50 = 1000 and 600 nM, respectively). 
We conducted a preoperative window study of <el> metformin <le> in endometrial cancer (EC) patients and evaluated its antiproliferative, molecular and metabolic effects. Twenty obese women with endometrioid EC were treated with <el> metformin <le> (850 mg) daily for up to 4 weeks prior to surgical staging. Expression of the <re> proliferation <er> marker Ki-67, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and downstream targets of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway were measured by immunohistochemistry. Global, untargeted metabolomics analysis of serum pre- and postmetformin treatment, and matched tumor, was performed. Metformin reduced <re> proliferation <er> by 11.75% (P = 0.008) based on the comparison of pre- and posttreatment endometrial tumors. A total of 65% of patients responded to <el> metformin <le> as defined by a decrease in Ki-67 staining in their endometrial tumors post-treatment. Metformin decreased expression of phosphorylated (p)-AMPK (P = 0.00001), p-Akt (P = 0.0002), p-S6 (51.2%, P = 0.0002), p-4E-BP-1 (P = 0.001), and ER (P = 0.0002) but not PR expression. Metabolomic profiling of serum indicated that responders versus nonresponders to treatment were more sensitive to <el> metformin <le>'s effects on induction of lipolysis, which correlated with increased fatty acid oxidation and glycogen metabolism in matched tumors. 
Because of mounting evidence of precipitation of calcium <re> oxalate <er> in the soft tissues of patients with end-stage renal disease (<el> ESRD <le>) on maintenance hemodialysis, the plasma <re> oxalate <er> concentrations and calculated dialysis removal of <re> oxalate <er> were studied in seven patients without evidence of either primary or absorption hyperoxaluria prior to <el> ESRD <le>. A reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatographic method was developed to quantitate serum <re> oxalate <er>. Mean value +/- SE in four healthy controls was 28 +/- 5 mumol/L, and in the seven patients it was 187 +/- 15 mumol/L predialysis and 89 +/- 11 mumol/L postdialysis. Oxalate deposition in the soft tissues of <el> ESRD <le> patients is the consequence of sustained hyperoxalemia. Oxalate removal by dialysis was calculated from the four-hour <re> oxalate <er> clearance. Since the ionic radii of phosphate and <re> oxalate <er> are similar, total <re> oxalate <er> clearance was calculated midpoint of dialysis. Mean <re> oxalate <er> removal/dialysis was 3.01 +/- 0.283 mmol. On a daily basis this value was 1.645 +/- 0.155 mmol, which is about threefold the normal <re> oxalate <er> excretion rate. It is not significantly different from the excretion rate in absorption oxalurias but is less than that in primary hyperoxaluria. 
Both hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia stimulate whole body and muscle glucose disposal. To define the impact of increased <el> lactate <le> concentration (4-5 mM) on muscle glucose disposal during hyperglycemia, we studied anesthetized normal rats infused with either sodium <el> lactate <le> or sodium bicarbonate as control. Animals were studied under hyperglycemic clamp (13 mM) using [3-3H]glucose (study 1) and 2-deoxy-[1-3H]glucose (study 2) to assess glucose rate of disappearance (Rd), glycolytic flux (GF), <re> glycogen <er> synthesis, and glucose utilization index by different tissues. Moreover, in study 3, the effect of <el> lactate <le> on the pattern of plasma insulin response to hyperglycemia was evaluated. In study 1, <el> lactate <le> infusion resulted in an increased Rd (38.7 +/- 1.7 vs. 32.3 +/- 1.3 mg.min-1.kg-1; P < 0.01), which was explained by an enhanced rate of <re> glycogen <er> synthesis (23.0 +/- 1.7 vs. 14.7 +/- 1.2 mg.min-1.kg-1; P < 0.001), whereas GF was unchanged. In study 2, <el> lactate <le>-infused animals showed an increased 2-deoxy-glucose disposal and a stimulated <re> glycogen <er> synthase activity as well as an increased <re> glycogen <er> accumulation at the end of the study in several skeletal muscles. In study 3, <el> lactate <le> did not induce any change in either early or late insulin response to hyperglycemia. 
Increasing evidence suggests that cytokines may play a role in ovarian processes. The purpose of this study was to determine if interleukin-1 (<el> IL-1 <le>) could modulate rabbit pre-ovulatory follicular function and to explore cellular sites of <el> IL-1 <le> biosynthesis in rabbit follicles. Development of rabbit pre-ovulatory follicles was induced by 200 mIU equine chorionic <re> gonadotropin <er> daily for 2 days. Seventy-two hours after the last injection, ovaries were excised and granulosa and theca cells isolated. The two types of cell were pre-incubated for 24 h in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), and then incubated for 24 h in MEM with 2.5% FCS with appropriate stimulants. Results showed that rabbit granulosa and theca cell culture supernatants contain <el> IL-1 <le> bioactivity and that this bioactivity was diminished by <re> gonadotropin <er>s, FSH and human chorionic <re> gonadotropin <er>, in a dose-dependent manner. Low doses of <el> IL-1 <le> (1 ng/ml) inhibited <re> gonadotropin <er>-induced progesterone production in both cell types and at the same time increased cell numbers. A study of the mechanism of <el> IL-1 <le> action demonstrated that it affects cAMP generation, and also steps distal to cAMP formation. 
It has been well documented that as individuals age, body composition changes, even in the absence of changes in body weight. Studies have shown that fat <re> mass <er> increases and muscle <re> mass <er> decreases with age. However, it is unclear why such changes occur. Resting metabolic rate (<el> RMR <le>) and substrate oxidation rates have been examined with aging. It has been proposed that reductions in <el> RMR <le> and fat oxidation may lead to changes in body composition. Alternatively, changes in body composition with aging may lead to reductions in <el> RMR <le>. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the literature surrounding the impact of aging on <el> RMR <le> and substrate oxidation. Although long-term longitudinal studies are lacking, most cross-sectional studies or short-term longitudinal studies show a reduction in <el> RMR <le> with aging that cannot be explained by changes in body composition including loss in fat-free <re> mass <er>, where the latter includes atrophy or decreases in the <re> mass <er> of high metabolic rate organs. There is indirect evidence suggesting that the metabolic rate of individual organs is lower in older compared with younger individuals. 
Liver-related mortality is increased in the setting of HIV-hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection. However, interactions between HIV and HBV to explain this observation have not been described. We hypothesized that <el> HIV infection <le> of hepatocytes directly affects the life cycle of HBV. We infected human hepatic cell lines expressing HBV (Hep3B and AD38 cells) or not expressing HBV (Huh7, HepG2, and AD43 cells) with laboratory strains of HIV (NL4-3 and AD8), as well as a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-pseudotyped HIV expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Following <el> HIV infection <le> with NL4-3 or AD8 in hepatic cell lines, we observed a significant increase in HIV reverse transcriptase activity which was infectious. Despite no detection of surface CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4 by flow cytometry, AD8 infection of AD38 cells was inhibited by maraviroc and NL4-3 was inhibited by AMD3100, demonstrating that HIV enters AD38 hepatic cell lines via CCR5 or CXCR4. High-level infection of AD38 cells (50%) was achieved using VSV-pseudotyped HIV. Coinfection of the AD38 cell line with HIV did not alter the HBV DNA amount or species as determined by Southern blotting or nucleic acid signal amplification. However, coinfection with HIV was associated with a significant increase in intracellular <re> HBsAg <er> when measured by Western blotting, quantitative <re> HBsAg <er>, and fluorescence microscopy. 
Fatty liver diseases are complications of the metabolic syndrome associated with <re> obesity <er>, insulin resistance and low grade inflammation. Our aim was to uncover mechanisms contributing to hepatic complications in this setting. We used foz/foz mice prone to <re> obesity <er>, insulin resistance and progressive fibrosing non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Foz/foz mice are hyperphagic but wild-type (WT)-matched calorie intake failed to protect against <re> obesity <er>, adipose inflammation and glucose intolerance. Obese foz/foz mice had similar physical activity level but reduced energy expenditure. Thermogenic adaptation to high-fat diet (HFD) or to cold exposure was severely impaired in foz/foz mice compared with HFD-fed WT littermates due to lower sympathetic tone in their brown adipose tissue (<el> BAT <le>). Intermittent cold exposure (ICE) restored <el> BAT <le> function and thereby improved glucose tolerance, decreased fat mass and liver steatosis. 
Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) apoptosis plays an essential role in vascular development and atherosclerosis. Hyperglycemia inhibits VSMC apoptosis, which may contribute to the development of diabetic vasculopathy. In the present study, we analyzed the mechanism of high-glucose-induced anti-apoptotic effect in cultured human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). Compared with normoglycemia, exposure of HASMCs to <el> hyperglycemia <le> but not mannitol significantly increased sphingosine kinase 1 (<re> SK1 <er>) activity but not SK2 activity. This increase was inhibited by protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor GF109203X, the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, and the reduced form of glutathione. The mechanism of <re> SK1 <er> activation by high glucose involves plasma membrane translocation. In addition, <el> hyperglycemia <le> markedly inhibited serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis in HASMCs. Importantly, inhibition of <re> SK1 <er> by either a competitive inhibitor N',N'-dimethylsphingosine or expression of dominant-negative mutant of <re> SK1 <er>(G82D) or specific small interference RNA knockdown substantially attenuated <el> hyperglycemia <le>-induced anti-apoptotic effect and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 expression in HASMCs. Moreover, <re> SK1 <er>-mediated anti-apoptotic effect requires the intracellular effects of sphingosine-1-phosphate. 
Calcium antagonists normalize endothelial dysfunction and improve the clinical outcome in patients with hypertension. However, the mechanism underlying these beneficial effects remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that the <el> calcium <le> antagonist nifedipine upregulates the expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn SOD), an endogenous antioxidant enzyme, in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) via cellular interactions between VSMC and endothelial cells (EC). Nifedipine induced upregulation of Mn SOD activity and expression in VSMC when cocultured with EC but not when cultured individually. NG-Monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), an inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, inhibited the upregulation of <re> Mn SOD expression <er> induced by nifedipine. Additionally, N-ethyl-2-(1-ethyl-2-hydroxy-2-nitrosohydrazino) ethanamine, a NO donor, reversed this inhibition by L-NMMA, indicating that NO may be involved in the mechanism underlying the nifedipine-induced upregulation of Mn SOD in VSMC. Preincubation of VSMC with Mn SOD antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODN) blocked the suppressive effects of nifedipine on DNA synthesis in VSMC cocultured with EC, whereas sense ODN had no effect. 
Chlorogenic acid (<el> CGA <le>) is a polyphenol found in coffee and medicinal herbs such as Lonicera japonica. In this study, the effect of <el> CGA <le>-induced relaxation on carbachol (CCh)-induced contraction of mouse urinary bladder was investigated. <el> CGA <le> (30-300 μg/ml) inhibited CCh- or U46619-induced contraction in a concentration-dependent manner. SQ22536 (adenylyl cyclase inhibitor) recovered <el> CGA <le>-induced relaxation of CCh-induced contraction; however, ODQ (guanylyl cyclase inhibitor) did not have the same effect. In addition, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) enhanced <el> CGA <le>-induced relaxation; however, forskolin or sodium nitroprusside did not have the same effect. Moreover, Ro 20-1724, a selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 inhibitor, enhanced <el> CGA <le>-induced relaxation, but vardenafil, a selective PDE5 inhibitor, did not have the same effect. In the presence of CCh, <el> CGA <le> increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) level, whereas SQ22536 inhibited the increase of <re> cAMP levels <er>. Moreover, higher <re> cAMP levels <er> were obtained with <el> CGA <le> plus IBMX treatment than the total <re> cAMP levels <er> obtained with separate <el> CGA <le> and IBMX treatments. 
The administration of the stable adenosine analog (R)-N-(1-methyl-2-phenylethyl)adenosine (R-PIA) caused a dose-dependent decrease in the accumulation of striatal dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) levels following DOPA decarboxylase inhibition, with the minimum effective dose being 0.2 mg/kg, i.p.; 5'-deoxy-5'-(ethylamino)-5'-oxoadenosine (<el> NECA <le>) at 0.5 mg/kg, i.p., was also active indicating that in vivo R-PIA and <el> NECA <le> were decreasing striatal dopamine (<re> DA <er>) synthesis. Both R-PIA and <el> NECA <le> also decreased striatal levels of the <re> DA <er> metabolite 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT), indicating a decreased release of <re> DA <er> which was consistent with their effects on <re> DA <er> synthesis. N-Cyclohexyladenosine (CHA) also decreased 3-MT levels. The S-isomer of PIA at an equipotent dose did not affect either <re> DA <er> synthesis or release. R-PIA (3 mg/kg, i.p.) antagonized the pargyline-induced increase in striatal 3-MT levels as did gamma-butyrolactone, further confirming a decreased release of striatal <re> DA <er>. The adenosine receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyltheophylline antagonized the R-PIA induced-decrease in striatal <re> DA <er> synthesis, suggesting that the latter was mediated via adenosine receptors. 
An impaired spinal GABAergic inhibitory function is known to be pivotal in neuropathic pain (<el> NPP <le>). At present, data concerning time-dependent alterations within the GABAergic system itself and post-synaptic GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory transmission are highly controversial, likely related to the experimental <el> NPP <le> model used. Furthermore, it is unknown whether the severity of <el> NPP <le> is determined by the degree of these GABAergic disturbances. In the present study we therefore examined in one experimental animal model whether anatomical changes within the spinal GABAergic system and its GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory function are gradually aggravated during the development of partial sciatic nerve injury (PSNL)-induced <el> NPP <le> and are related to the severity of PSNL-induced hypersensitivity. Three and 16 days after a unilateral PSNL (early and late <el> NPP <le>, respectively), GABA-immunoreactivity (GABA-IR) and the number of GABA-IR neuronal profiles were determined in Rexed laminae 1-3 of lumbar spinal cord cryosections. Additionally, the efficiency of dorsal horn GABA(A) receptor-induced inhibition was examined by cation chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2) immunoblotting. <el> NPP <le>-induced hypersensitivity was only observed at the ipsilateral side, both at early and late time points. During early <el> NPP <le>, a decrease in ipsilateral dorsal horn GABA-IR was observed without alterations in the number of GABA-IR neuronal profiles or KCC2 protein levels. In contrast, bilateral increases in spinal GABA-IR accompanied by an unchanged number of GABA-IR interneurons were observed during late <el> NPP <le>. This was furthermore attended with decreased ipsilateral <re> KCC2 levels <er>. Moreover, the degree of hypersensitivity was not related to disturbances within the spinal GABAergic system at all time points examined. 
To assess the effects of <el> lactate <le> on <re> glucose <er> metabolism, sodium <el> lactate <le> (20 mumol.kg-1.min-1) was infused into healthy subjects in basal conditions and during application of a hyperinsulinaemic (6 pmol.kg-1.min-1) euglycaemic clamp. Glucose rate of appearance (GRa) and disappearance (GRd) were measured from plasma dilution of infused U- 13C <re> glucose <er>, and <re> glucose <er> oxidation (G(ox)) from breath 13CO2 and plasma 13C <re> glucose <er>. In basal conditions, <el> lactate <le> infusion did not alter G(ox) (8.8 +/- 0.9 vs 9.2 +/- 1.1 mumol.kg-1.min-1), while GRa slightly decreased from 15.2 +/- 0.8 basal to 13.9 +/- 0.9 mumol.kg-1.min-1 after <el> lactate <le> (p < 0.05). During a hyperinsulinaemic clamp, hepatic <re> glucose <er> production was completely suppressed with or without <el> lactate <le>. Lactate decreased G(ox) from 17.1 +/- 0.4 to 13.4 +/- 1.2 mumol.kg-1.min-1 (p < 0.05), whereas GRd was unchanged (39.7 +/- 3.6 vs 45.6 +/- 2.6 mumol.kg-1.min-1. 
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (<re> HP <er>) is mediated by Th1 immune response. NKT cells regulate immune responses by modulating the Th1/Th2 balance. Therefore, we postulated that NKT cells play a critical role in the development of the <re> HP <er> by modulating the Th1/Th2 response. To address this issue, we explored the functional roles of NKT cells in Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula (<el> SR <le>)-induced <re> HP <er>. In CD1d(-/-) mice, the <re> HP <er> was worse in terms of histological changes, hydroxyproline levels, the CD4:CD8 ratio in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and <el> SR <le>-specific immune responses than in control mice. CD1d(-/-) mice showed elevated IFN-gamma production in the lung during the <re> HP <er>, and this was produced mainly by Gr-1+ neutrophils. The blockade of IFN-gamma in CD1d(-/-) mice attenuated the <re> HP <er>, whereas the injection of rIFN-gamma aggravated it. Moreover, the depletion of Gr-1+ neutrophils reduced CD8+ T cell numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid during the <re> HP <er>. The adoptive transfer of IL-4(-/-) mouse NKT cells did not attenuate the <re> HP <er>, whereas wild-type or IFN-gamma(-/-) mouse NKT cells suppressed the <re> HP <er>. 
We have examined the effect of transforming growth factor beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)) and overexpression of the <el> Smad4 <le> gene on the phenotype of <re> Car <er> C, a ras mutated highly malignant spindle carcinoma cell line. TGF-beta(1)-treated <re> Car <er> C cells overexpressing <el> Smad4 <le> spread with a flattened morphology with membrane ruffles abundant in vinculin and show a reduction in their invasive abilities. TGF-beta(1) treatment and overexpression of <el> Smad4 <le> also enhanced the production of PAI-1 measured by the activation of the p3TP-lux reporter gene containing a PAI-1-related promoter. This activation was abolished with a dominant-negative <el> Smad4 <le> construct. 
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, symmetric, systemic autoimmune disease. Because insufficient <re> apoptosis <er> of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) is an important characteristic of RA, promoting <re> apoptosis <er> is considered a potential therapeutic tool for treating RA. We have previously found that daphnetin (7,8-dihydroxycoumarin, <el> DAP <le>) has a pro-apoptotic effect on fibroblast-like synoviocytes from collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats. In the present study, we further investigated the mechanisms of <el> DAP <le>-induced <re> apoptosis <er> in CIA-FLS. CIA-FLS were incubated with <el> DAP <le> for 48 h in the presence or absence of caspase inhibitors, including inhibitors of caspase-3, caspase-8, or caspase-9 or a pan-caspase inhibitor; then, a series of experiments were performed to evaluate the mechanisms of <el> DAP <le>-induced <re> apoptosis <er>. Our results showed that <el> DAP <le> markedly decreased cell viability and induced the <re> apoptosis <er> of CIA-FLS along with typical morphological and ultrastructural changes; moreover, <el> DAP <le> increased FasL, cytochrome c (Cyt-c), Bax, caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 mRNA expression and Bax, caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 protein expression. In contrast, <el> DAP <le> decreased Bcl-2 mRNA and protein expression and promoted the release of Cyt-c from the mitochondria into the cytosol; these effects were attenuated to varying degrees by pre-treatment with caspase inhibitors, especially with caspase-3 or caspase-9 inhibitors or a pan-caspase inhibitor. 
We have previously demonstrated that <el> 5-HT <le> stimulates not only basal but also thyrotropin-releasing-hormone (TRH)-induced prolactin (PRL) release by acting directly at the pituitary gland level. In the present report, the participation of an autoparacrine action of VIP in the stimulatory effects of <el> 5-HT <le> and the involvement of the <el> 5-HT <le>2 receptor type in mediating serotonin-induced <re> PRL release <er> have been examined. Cultured anterior pituitary cells from ovariectomized adult rats were incubated for 1 h in 1 ml of T3-supplemented medium with or without the test substances. The results obtained in the presence of T3 confirm our previous observations, since treatment of the cells with <el> 5-HT <le> caused dose-dependent increases in basal <re> PRL release <er>, with an approximate EC50 of 3.68 x 10(-8) M, and led to a significant potentiation (1.3-fold) of the TRH-induced <re> PRL release <er>. In order to evaluate the possible participation of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) as mediator of the effects of <el> 5-HT <le> on <re> PRL release <er>, cells were incubated in the presence of <el> 5-HT <le> alone (3-1,000 nM) or 100 nM <el> 5-HT <le> plus 30 nM TRH, with or without 200 nM VIP antagonist (VIP-At): [D,4-Cl-Ph6,Leu17]VIP. VIP-At partially inhibited the release of PRL induced by <el> 5-HT <le>, both basal and TRH-stimulated release. The stimulatory effect of <el> 5-HT <le>, however, was not eliminated by VIP-At, since the <re> PRL release <er>d in response to <el> 5-HT <le> was still over the respective control ones. These results further support the findings suggesting that <el> 5-HT <le> acts directly at pituitary level by stimulating <re> PRL release <er>. Addition of the <el> 5-HT <le>2 receptor antagonist, ketanserin (1 microM) into the incubation medium resulted in the loss of cellular responsiveness to <el> 5-HT <le>, preventing not only the stimulatory effect of <el> 5-HT <le> on the basal but also on the TRH-induced <re> PRL release <er>. 
Excessive or prolonged exposure to excitatory amino acids (EAA) are thought to be neurotoxic by altering <el> calcium <le> homeostasis. A protective role of <re> Calbindin <er>-D-28 k (<re> Calbindin <er>) has been postulated due to its capacity to buffer <el> calcium <le>. <re> Calbindin <er> is highly expressed in the Purkinje cells (PCs), of the cerebellar cortex. Changes of the <re> Calbindin <er> immunoreactivity (IR) by the EAA has been here investigated in cerebellar slices maintained in vitro. It was found that at low temperature, PCs are very slightly immunoreactive and therefore the experiments were done at 22 degrees C. The results show that <re> Calbindin <er>-IR increases in PCs exposed to the neurotoxic agonists, Kainic acid (KA) and AMPA as well as to glutamate (Glu), the endogenous EAA. The increase is very rapid and slowly reversible; is induced by excitatory and excitotoxic concentrations of the agonists; is independent of the <el> calcium <le> influx. While KA- and AMPA-induced <re> Calbindin <er>-IR is blocked by CNQX, the KA/AMPA receptor antagonist, Glu-induced <re> Calbindin <er>-IR is only slightly decreased by CNQX and AP5, the NMDA receptor antagonist. 
Recent research has demonstrated that an increase in <re> glucose <er> utilization by skeletal muscle occurs in hemorrhagic shock. It is conceivable that the hypoglycemia of gram-negative septic shock is, in part, due to increased <re> glucose <er> utilization by peripheral tissues. The hypothesis tested in this study was that there is an increase in <re> glucose <er> uptake by the isolated innervated and/or denervated forelimb of the dog subjected to <el> endotoxin <le> shock. Results indicate that <el> endotoxin <le> does not affect a net increase of <re> glucose <er> uptake by the isolated forelimb. No increase in uptake occurred when blood <re> glucose <er> concentration was normal. However, when <el> endotoxin <le> hypotension induced a significant hyperglycemia or when arterial <re> glucose <er> concentration was elevated by <re> glucose <er> administration an apparent increase in forelimb <re> glucose <er> uptake occurred. 
Bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of osteoclast function widely used to treat excessive bone resorption associated, e.g., with bone metastases. They have also antitumor activity. However, it is unclear whether this reflects an indirect effect via inhibition of bone resorption or a direct antitumor effect. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs), including zoledronic acid (<el> ZOL <le>), act by inhibiting farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS). The mevalonate pathway is blocked and the accumulation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) consequently occurs. IPP is conjugated to AMP to form a novel ATP analog (ApppI). The present study was undertaken to clarify whether IPP and/or ApppI has a direct involvement in <re> apoptosis <er> caused by <el> ZOL <le> in different cancer cell lines. There are marked differences in <el> ZOL <le>-induced ApppI formation between different cancer cell lines. On this basis, we selected three cancer cell lines that differ significantly from each other in their <el> ZOL <le>-induced IPP and ApppI accumulation: human estrogen-dependent (MCF7) and estrogen-independent (MDA-MB 436) breast cancer cell lines and a human myeloma cell line (RPMI 8226). The amount of IPP/ApppI correlated with the capacity of cells to undergo <re> apoptosis <er>. Geranylgeraniol (GGOH), an intermediate of mevalonate metabolism, blocks both IPP and ApppI formation and to some degree <el> ZOL <le>-induced <re> apoptosis <er> in a cell line-dependent manner. In addition, lovastatin (LOV), an inhibitor of the enzyme HMGCoA reductase, completely blocks IPP/ApppI formation as determined by mass spectrometry analysis, but enhances <re> apoptosis <er>. 
The pituitary gland is a heterogeneous tissue comprised of several hormone secreting and supporting cells, most of which are targeted by estrogens. Estrogen-induced changes in the pituitary are presumably mediated via the classical estrogen receptor, <el> ER <le> alpha. However, a novel receptor, <el> ER <le> beta, and pituitary-specific truncated estrogen receptor products (TERPs) were recently identified. The objectives of this study were to examine the distribution of these receptors in the rat pituitary and compare their regulation by estradiol in Sprague-Dawley and the estrogen-sensitive Fischer 344 rats. Pituitary cryosections were subjected to immunocytochemistry for specific cell types, followed by in situ hybridization for <el> ER <le> alpha or <el> ER <le> beta. <el> ER <le> alpha was expressed by approximately 45% of the lactotrophs and melanotrophs, 35% of the corticotrophs and folliculo-stellate cells, and 25% of the gonadotrophs. The expression of <el> ER <le> beta showed a similar pattern but was generally lower than <el> ER <le> alpha. In two cell types, melanotrophs and gonadotrophs, <el> ER <le> beta expression was significantly lower than <el> ER <le> alpha. In the second experiment, pituitary sections were immunostained for <el> ER <le> alpha, followed by in situ hybridization for <el> ER <le> beta. Only a minute population (6-10%) of either anterior or intermediate lobe cells coexpressed <el> ER <le> alpha and <el> ER <le> beta. In the next experiment, Fischer 344 and Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with oil or estradiol for 24 h. Total RNA from dissected anterior and posterior (neurointermediate) pituitaries was subjected to RT-PCR for <el> ER <le> alpha, <el> ER <le> beta, or TERPs. Interestingly, <el> ER <le> alpha and <el> ER <le> beta were unchanged by estradiol in either lobe of the pituitary. In contrast, estradiol increased pituitary TERP <re> messenger RNA levels <er> 4- to 7-fold. A 20-kDa TERP protein was detected by Western blots in the pituitary but not the uterus. There were no differences in the estradiol-induced expression of any of the receptors between the two strains of rats. 
Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (<el> DPP-4 <le>) is currently being explored as a new approach to the treatment of type 2 diabetes. This concept has emerged from the powerful and rapid action of the enzyme to inactivate glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). However, other bioactive peptides with potential influence of islet function are also substrates of <el> DPP-4 <le>. Whether this inactivation may add to the beneficial effects of <el> DPP-4 <le> inhibition is not known. In this study, we explored whether <el> DPP-4 <le> inhibition by valine-pyrrolidide (val-pyr; 100 micromol/kg administered through gastric gavage at t = -30 min) affects the <re> insulin <er> and glucose responses to iv glucose (1 g/kg) together with GLP-1 (10 nmol/kg), glucose-dependent <re> insulin <er>otropic polypeptide (GIP; 10 nmol/kg), pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide 38 (PACAP38; 1.3 nmol/kg), or gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP; 20 nmol/kg) given at t = 0 in anesthetized C57BL/6J mice. It was found that the acute (1-5 min) <re> insulin <er> response to GLP-1 was augmented by val-pyr by 80% (4.2 +/- 0.4 vs. 7.6 +/- 0.8 nmol/liter), that to GIP by 40% (2.7 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.8 +/- 0.4 nmol/liter), that to PACAP38 by 75% (4.6 +/- 0.5 vs. 8.1 +/- 0.6 nmol/liter), and that to GRP by 25% (1.8 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.3 nmol/liter; all P < 0.05 or less). This was associated with enhanced glucose elimination rate after GLP-1 [glucose elimination constant (K(G)) 2.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 3.1 +/- 0.3%/min] and PACAP38 (2.1 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.2 +/- 0.3%/min; both P < 0.01), but not after GIP or GRP. The augmented <re> insulin <er> response to GRP by val-pyr was prevented by the GLP-1 receptor antagonist, exendin(3) (9-39), raising the possibility that GRP effects may occur secondary to stimulation of GLP-1 secretion. 
To determine whether verapamil prevents depletion of adenine nucleotides during and after severe myocardial ischemia, dogs were subjected to 15 min occlusions of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 240 min of reperfusion. One hour before occlusion, dogs were randomly assigned to a treatment group (n = 10) to which an infusion of intravenous verapamil was given until the onset of reperfusion or to an untreated saline group (n = 9). Verapamil reduced mean aortic pressure and heart rate. After 15 min of ischemia, endocardial adenosine triphosphate (<re> ATP <er>) level, determined by needle biopsy, decreased in the untreated group from 34.7 +/- 2.0 to 24.4 +/- 2.7 nmol X mg protein-1 (p less than .005 vs preocclusion) and in the verapamil group from 32.8 +/- 1.5 to 30.3 +/- 1.5 nmol X mg protein-1 (NS vs preocclusion). Dogs receiving verapamil had significantly higher <re> ATP <er> levels than untreated animals after 90 and 240 min of reperfusion. In untreated animals the sum of <el> inosine <le> and hypoxanthine levels increased during occlusion from very low levels to 4.6 +/- 1.1 nmol X mg protein-1 in the epicardium and to 6.8 +/- 1.5 nmol X mg protein-1 in the endocardium (p less than .05 compared with preocclusion values). In verapamil-treated dogs <el> inosine <le> and hypoxanthine levels increased to only 1.2 +/- 0.3 (epicardium) and 1.9 +/- 0.6 nmol X mg protein-1 (endocardium) (both NS compared with preocclusion values). After 90 min of reperfusion the sum of <re> ATP <er>, adenosine diphosphate, adenosine monophosphate, <el> inosine <le>, and hypoxanthine levels was decreased in the endocardium by 10.2 nmol X mg protein-1 in the untreated group, but no change was observed in verapamil-treated animals. 
Nitric oxide (NO) is a regulator of leukocyte <re> adhesion <er> in the microcirculation. This study was designed to examine the effects of a NO synthase inhibitor on neutrophil <re> adhesion <er> in the peritoneum, lung, liver, and kidney in a rat peritonitis model using a fluorescence microscopic method. Sprague-Dawley rats were given normal saline (control) or N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (<el> L-NAME <le>) at dosages of 10 mg/kg (N10) or 100 mg/kg (N100) (n = 66) intraperitoneally. One hour after pretreatment fluorescein-labeled neutrophils were infused without bacterial challenge (0 hr). Other rats received an injection of 10(7) Escherichia coli into the peritoneal cavity 1 hr after pretreatment. Labeled neutrophils were infused 1 and 5 hr after bacterial challenge. Just 2 min after neutrophil injection, blood samples were obtained and the animals were killed. Five peritoneal samples (omentum, mesentery, parietal peritoneum, colon, and ileum), both lungs, the liver, and the right kidney were harvested for counting of labeled neutrophils under epifluorescent microscopy. Combined plasma nitrite/nitrate levels were determined. In another set of rats (n = 36), an arterial catheter was inserted after <el> L-NAME <le> treatment and bacterial challenge. At 0, 1, 5, and 12 hr after challenge, blood pressure, heart rate, and arterial blood gas data were measured. One hour after E. coli challenge, the number of neutrophils in the peritoneum was significantly lower in both <el> L-NAME <le>-treated groups than in the control group. In contrast, the number of labeled neutrophils in the lungs was significantly higher in the N100 group than in the control group. Neutrophil accumulation in the lungs and peritoneum at 0 and 5 hr and in the liver and kidney at 0, 1, and 5 hr did not differ among groups, nor did combined plasma nitrite/nitrate levels. <el> L-NAME <le> treatment had no influence on either hemodynamic or blood gas data. 
Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) has dual effects on inflammation and cancer progression depending on the microenvironment. Estrogens have a protective effect on colorectal cancer (<re> CRC <er>) development. The aim of this study was to investigate <re> CRC <er> development in Nrf2 knockout (KO) mice. Azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated wild-type (WT) and Nrf2 KO male mice were sacrificed at weeks 2 and 16 after AOM injection with/without 17β-estradiol (E2) treatment during week 1. Disease activity index and colon tissue damage at week 2 showed strong attenuation following E2 administration in WT mice but to a lesser extent in Nrf2 KO male mice. At week 16, E2 significantly diminished AOM/DSS-induced adenoma/cancer incidence at distal colon in the Nrf2 KO group, but not in the WT. Furthermore, mRNA or protein levels of NF-κB-related mediators (i.e., iNOS, TNF-α, and IL-1β) and Nrf2-related antioxidants (i.e., NQO1 and HO-1) were significantly lower in the Nrf2 KO group regardless of E2 treatment compared to the WT. The expression of <el> estrogen <le> receptor beta (ERβ) was higher in the Nrf2 KO group than in the WT. 
The regulation of PTH-related protein (PTH-rP) gene expression by human endometrial stromal cells in monolayer culture was evaluated. 17 beta-Estradiol (E2), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), endothelin-1 (ET-1), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF beta 1), and serum stimulated PTH-rP production (evaluated by immunoassay of PTH-rP in the culture medium) by these cells. Treatment of endometrial stromal cells with E2 plus a progestin, medroxy-progesterone acetate (MPA), caused a decrease in PTH-rP production. PRL, epidermal growth factor, and dexamethasone, which are known to affect PTH-rP production (increase or decrease) in other cells, were ineffective in altering PTH-rP production in endometrial stromal cells, as were a number of other growth factors, viz. TGF alpha, platelet-derived growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor, and metabolites of progesterone. The effects of E2 and MPA on PTH-rP gene expression in these cells were investigated in detail. E2 (50 nM) increased <re> PTH-rP mRNA levels <er> (at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h). When serum (10%) was present in the medium, E2 (50 nM) did not increase PTH-rP production or <re> PTH-rP mRNA levels <er>, and in the presence of serum, E2 plus MPA did not decrease PTH-rP production. In cells that were pretreated with E2 (50 nM) for 48 h before treatment (18 h) with ET-1, TNF alpha, tetradecanoylphorbol acetate, and TGF beta 1, the production of PTH-rP was greater than that in cells not pretreated with <el> estrogen <le>. The effect of treatment of endometrial stromal cells with MPA on <re> PTH-rP mRNA levels <er> (at 2, 4, 8, and 12 h) was variable, but in all studies conducted, PTH-rP production after 18 or 24 h of progestin treatment was not increased compared with that in nontreated cells. 
Particles were chemically modified with <el> aldehyde <le>s and incubated with rat peritoneal cells for <re> phagocytosis <er>. All dialdehydes and lower monaldehydes tested (methanal, ethanal and propanal) made sheep erythrocytes phagocytosable. Failure of higher monaldehydes to induce <re> phagocytosis <er> of treated erythrocytes was not due to lack of reactivity with red cell membranes. All erythrocytes tested (bird and mammal red cells were used) and rat thymocytes were phagocytosed by rat macrophages after incubation with <el> aldehyde <le>. Treatment of Candida albicans did not induce <re> phagocytosis <er>: this failure was not due to lack of <el> aldehyde <le> binding (as demonstrated with [14C]-methanal) nor to anti-phagocytic properties of the parasite membrane. Sheep erythrocytes were submitted to enzymatic treatment (pronase, trypsin, neuraminidase) or incubated with succinic anhydride (to block free NH2 groups) or iodacetamide (to block free SH groups) before <el> aldehyde <le> treatment: <re> phagocytosis <er> was not decreased, which suggested that <el> aldehyde <le>s did not act by altering some definite surface structure of the treated particles. Treatment of erythrocytes with cross-linking compounds such as tetraazotized o-dianisidine (coupling occurs mainly on tyrosine and histidine residues) or l-ethyl(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide (a bivalent reagent binding free COOH groups) did not induce any substantial <re> phagocytosis <er> of erythrocytes. Phagocytosis of <el> aldehyde <le> treated erythrocytes was partly correlated with hydrophobicity of these cells, as measured with a two-phase partition system. 
Although testicular germ cell tumors are generally quite responsive to treatment with <el> cisplatin <le>, a small fraction of them acquire resistance during therapy. Even when <el> cisplatin <le> treatment is successful the patient is often left with a residual teratoma at the site of the primary tumor suggesting that <el> cisplatin <le> may trigger <re> differentiation <er> in some tumors. Using the human embryonal carcinoma cell line NTera2/D1, we confirmed that exposure to the differentiating agent retinoic acid produced a reduction in pluripotency markers NANOG and POU5F1 (Oct3/4) and an acute concentration-dependent increase in resistance to both <el> cisplatin <le> and paclitaxel that reached as high as 18-fold for <el> cisplatin <le> and 61-fold for paclitaxel within four days. A two day exposure to <el> cisplatin <le> also produced a concentration-dependent decrease in the expression of the NANOG and POU5F1 and increased expression of three markers whose levels increase with <re> differentiation <er> including Nestin, SCG10 and Fibronectin. In parallel, exposure to <el> cisplatin <le> induced up to 6.2-fold resistance to itself and 104-fold resistance to paclitaxel. Paclitaxel did not induce <re> differentiation <er> or resistance to either itself or <el> cisplatin <le>. Neither retinoic acid nor <el> cisplatin <le> induced resistance in cervical or prostate cancer cell lines or other germ cell tumor lines in which they failed to alter the expression of NANOG and POU5F1. Forced expression of NANOG prevented the induction of resistance to <el> cisplatin <le> by retinoic acid. 
Insulin and <re> insulin <er> growth factor type 1 (<el> IGF-1 <le>) and their receptors are closely related molecules, but both factors bind to the receptor of the other one with a weak affinity. No study has presently documented a role of <re> insulin <er> as a myeloma growth factor (MGF) for human multiple myeloma cells (MMCs), whereas many studies have concluded that <el> IGF-1 <le> is a major MGF. <el> IGF-1 <le> receptor (<el> IGF-1 <le>R) is aberrantly expressed by MMCs in association with a poor prognosis. In this study we show that <re> insulin <er> receptor (INSR) is increased throughout normal plasma cell differentiation. INSR gene is also expressed by MMCs of 203/206 newly diagnosed patients. Insulin is an MGF as potent as <el> IGF-1 <le> at physiological concentrations and requires the presence of <re> insulin <er>/<el> IGF-1 <le> hybrid receptors, stimulating INSR(+)<el> IGF-1 <le>R(+) MMCs, unlike INSR(+)<el> IGF-1 <le>R(-) or INSR(-)<el> IGF-1 <le>R(-) MMCs. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that INSR is linked with <el> IGF-1 <le>R in MMCs and that <re> insulin <er> induces both <el> IGF-1 <le>R and INSR phosphorylations and vice versa. 
The capsaicin receptor (TRPV1) antagonist <el> ABT-102 <le> demonstrates efficacy in multiple preclinical pain models. However, evolving clinical data for this compound class suggest potentially profound drug-induced thermosensory impairment. Safety and tolerability of <el> ABT-102 <le> were assessed in a multiple-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized healthy volunteer trial. Thirty-six participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to <el> ABT-102 <le>:placebo in 3 dose groups (1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg twice a day) and confined to an inpatient research unit for a 7-day treatment period and 3 follow-up days. Outcome measures included: oral and cutaneous cold detection, warm detection (WDT), and heat pain thresholds (<re> HPT <er>); oral perceived heat intensity (oral liquid test); time to hand withdrawal (water bath test); and cutaneous pain intensity (long thermal stimulus). Significant dose-dependent (placebo- and baseline-adjusted) increases in <re> HPT <er> and reduced painfulness of suprathreshold heat were present from days 1-7. For <el> ABT-102 <le> 4 mg twice a day, model-based mean differences from placebo (95% confidence interval) were as follows: oral <re> HPT <er>, day 1=2.5°C (0.6-4.4), day 5=4.4°C (2.5-6.3); cutaneous <re> HPT <er>, day 2=3.3°C (1.4-5.3), day 5=5.3°C (3.3-7.2); oral WDT, day 1=2.6°C (0.5-4.7), day 5=2.7°C (0.6-4.9); cutaneous WDT, day 2=1.3 (0.0-2.6), day 5=1.6 (0.3-2.8) (all P<0.05). Oral liquid test and water bath test results followed a similar pattern. There was no effect on cutaneous cold detection. All effects were fully reversed by day 10. There were no other relevant safety findings. Core body temperature remained below 39°C in all participants. 
Carotenoids are important micronutrients in the human diet and are present in human serum at micromolar concentrations. In addition to their antioxidant potential, carotenoids obtain physiologically relevant properties such as influencing cellular signal pathways, gene expression or induction of detoxifying enzymes. In this study, we determined the transactivation of <el> PXR <le> by cotransfection with the full-length receptor and a <el> PXR <le>-responsive reporter gene. Carotenoids and retinol revealed a 5-6 fold reporter gene activity in HepG2 cells in comparison to a 7-fold induction by the well-known <el> PXR <le> agonist rifampicin, whereas apo-carotenals and lycopene exerted less or no activation potential. The inductive efficacy was hereby concentration-dependent. In addition, carotenoid- or retinol-mediated gene expression of <el> PXR <le>-responsive genes like CYP3A4/CYP3A7, <re> CYP3A5 <er>, MDR-1 and MRP-2 has been determined in HepG2 cells by RT-PCR with up-regulative properties of beta-carotene or retinol being comparable to or even higher than that of rifampicin. 
A single episode of status epilepticus (<el> SE <le>) induced in rodents by the convulsant pilocarpine, produces, after a latent period of > or = 2 weeks, a chronic epileptic condition. During the latent period of epileptogenesis, most CA1 pyramidal cells that normally fire in a regular pattern, acquire low-threshold bursting behaviour, generating high-frequency clusters of 3-5 spikes as their minimal response to depolarizing stimuli. Recruitment of a Ni(2+)- and amiloride-sensitive T-type Ca(2+) current (I(<re> CaT <er>)), shown to be up-regulated after <el> SE <le>, plays a critical role in burst generation in most cases. Several lines of evidence suggest that I(<re> CaT <er>) driving bursting is located in the apical dendrites. Thus, bursting was suppressed by focally applying Ni(2+) to the apical dendrites, but not to the soma. It was also suppressed by applying either tetrodotoxin or the K(V)7/M-type K(+) channel agonist retigabine to the apical dendrites. Severing the distal apical dendrites approximately 150 microm from the pyramidal layer also abolished this activity. Intradendritic recordings indicated that evoked bursts are associated with local Ni(2+)-sensitive slow spikes. Blocking persistent Na(+) current did not modify bursting in most cases. 
The use of growth <re> differentiation <er> factor 5 (<el> GDF-5 <le>) in damaged tendons has been shown to improve tendon repair. It has been hypothesized that further improvements may be achieved when <el> GDF-5 <le> is used to promote cell proliferation and induce tenogenic <re> differentiation <er> in human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). However, the optimal conditions required to produce these effects on hMSCs have not been demonstrated in previous studies. A study to determine cell proliferation and tenogenic <re> differentiation <er> in hMSCs exposed to different concentrations of <el> GDF-5 <le> (0, 5, 25, 50, 100 and 500 ng/ml) was thus conducted. No significant changes were observed in the cell proliferation rate in hMSCs treated at different concentrations of <el> GDF-5 <le>. <el> GDF-5 <le> appeared to induce tenogenic <re> differentiation <er> at 100 ng/ml, as reflected by (1) a significant increase in total collagen expression, similar to that of the primary native human tenocyte culture; (2) a significant upregulation in candidate tenogenic marker gene expression, i.e. scleraxis, tenascin-C and type-I collagen; (3) the ratio of type-I collagen to type-III collagen expression was elevated to levels similar to that of human tenocyte cultures, and (4) a significant downregulation of the non-tenogenic marker genes runt-related transcription factor 2 and sex determining region Y (SRY)-box 9 at day 7 of <el> GDF-5 <le> induction, further excluding hMSC <re> differentiation <er> into other lineages. 
Progesterone (P4) inhibits the gastrointestinal muscle contraction by downregulating <el> Galpha <le>(q/11) proteins that mediate contraction, by upregulating <el> Galpha <le>(s) proteins that mediate relaxation, and by altering the pattern of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes and prostaglandins. We aimed to examine whether P4 treatment of guinea pigs in vivo affects basal colon motility [basal motility index (MI)] by altering the levels and actions of <re> PGF <er>(2alpha) and PGE(2). Guinea pigs were treated with intramuscular (IM) P4 for 4 days. The BASAL MI, the <re> PGF <er>(2alpha)-induced contraction, and PGE(2)-induced inhibition of contraction were examined in muscle strips and cells. The levels of <re> PGF <er>(2alpha) and PGE(2) were measured by radioimmunoassay. Treatment with P4 reduced the basal MI, the levels of <re> PGF <er>(2alpha), and <re> PGF <er>(2alpha)-induced contraction. P4 increased PGE(2) levels, and PGE(2) induced relaxation. Pretreatment with IM RU-486 (10 mg/kg per day), a P4 receptor antagonist, 1 h before P4 blocked the actions of P4. The <re> PGF <er>(2alpha) antagonist Al-1180 abolished basal MI and <re> PGF <er>(2alpha)-induced contraction. N-ethylmaleimide, which blocks unoccupied membrane receptors, blocked Ach and VIP actions but had no effect on <re> PGF <er>(2alpha) and PGE(2) effects. A COX-1 inhibitor decreased and a COX-2 inhibitor increased <re> PGF <er>(2alpha) levels; GTPgammaS increased and GDPbetaS decreased the levels of <re> PGF <er>(2alpha). <el> Galpha <le>(q/11) protein antibodies (Abs) reduced <re> PGF <er>(2alpha) levels, and <el> Galpha <le>(i3) Abs blocked its motor actions. <el> Galpha <le>s Abs increased <re> PGF <er>(2alpha) but decreased PGE(2) levels. 
The effect of flurbiprofen, a potent cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, on <el> histamine <le> and methacholine reactivity was assessed in seven atopic subjects with asthma. Flurbiprofen 150 mg daily for three days displaced the <el> histamine <le>-FEV1 concentration-response curve to the right by 1.5 doubling doses, whereas no effect was observed on the response to methacholine. Subsequently the effects of flurbiprofen and terfenadine, a specific H1 <el> histamine <le> receptor antagonist, on <re> allergen <er> induced bronchoconstriction were studied in seven atopic but non-asthmatic subjects. The subjects inhaled the concentration of grass pollen <re> allergen <er> that had previously been shown to produce a 20% fall in FEV1 on separate occasions after prior treatment with placebo, flurbiprofen 150 mg daily for three days, terfenadine 180 mg three hours before challenge, and the combination of flurbiprofen and terfenadine. After placebo, <re> allergen <er> challenge caused a mean (SEM) maximum fall in FEV1 of 37.6% (2.6%) after 20 (3.7) minutes, followed by a gradual recovery to within 15% of baseline at 60 minutes. Terfenadine reduced the maximum <re> allergen <er> provoked fall in FEV1 to 21.5% (2.2%) and reduced the area under the time-response curve (AUC) by 50% (6%). Flurbiprofen alone reduced the mean maximum fall in FEV1 to 29.6% (3.2%) and reduced the AUC by 26%. The effect of the combination of flurbiprofen and terfenadine did not differ significantly from that of terfenadine alone. 
FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (<re> FLT3 <er>) is almost universally expressed in B-precursor childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Cases of ALL with MLL gene rearrangements and those with high hyperdiploidy (> 50 chromosomes) express the highest levels of <re> FLT3 <er>, and activating mutations of <re> FLT3 <er> occur in 18% of MLL-rearranged and 28% of hyperdiploid ALL cases. We determined the antileukemic activity of CEP-701, a potent and selective <el> <re> FLT3 <er> inhibitor <le>, in 8 ALL cell lines and 39 bone marrow samples obtained at diagnosis from infants and children with various subtypes of ALL. CEP-701 induced pronounced apoptotic responses in a higher percentage of samples that expressed high levels of <re> FLT3 <er> (74%, n = 23) compared with samples with low levels of expression (8%, n = 13; P = .0003). Sensitivity to <re> FLT3 <er> inhibition was particularly high in samples with MLL gene rearrangements (82%, n = 11; P = .0005), high hyperdiploidy (100%, n = 5; P = .0007), and/or <re> FLT3 <er> mutations (100%, n = 4; P = .0021). Seven of 7 sensitive samples examined by immunoblotting demonstrated constitutively phosphorylated <re> FLT3 <er> that was potently inhibited by CEP-701, whereas 0 of 6 resistant samples expressed constitutively phosphorylated <re> FLT3 <er>. 
The <el> E-cadherin <le> receptor CD103 (alpha(E)beta(7)-integrin) is expressed on specific populations of pulmonary dendritic cells (DC) and T cells. However, CD103 function in the lung is not well understood. Matrilysin (MMP-7) expression is increased in lung injury and cleaves <el> E-cadherin <le> from injured lung epithelium. Thus, to assess matrilysin effects on CD103-<el> E-cadherin <le> interactions in lung injury, wild-type, CD103(-/-), and Mmp7(-/-) mice, in which <el> E-cadherin <le> isn't cleaved in the lung, were treated with bleomycin or bleomycin with nFMLP to reverse the defect in acute neutrophil influx seen in Mmp7(-/-) mice. Pulmonary CD103(+) DC were significantly increased in injured wild-type compared with Mmp7(-/-) mice, and CD103(+) leukocytes showed significantly enhanced interaction with <el> E-cadherin <le> on injured wild-type epithelium than with Mmp7(-/-) epithelium in vitro and in vivo. Bleomycin-treated CD103(-/-) mice had persistent neutrophilic inflammation, increased <re> fibrosis <er>, and increased mortality compared with wild-type mice, a phenotype that was partially recapitulated in bleomycin/nFMLP-treated Mmp7(-/-) mice. Soluble <el> E-cadherin <le> increased IL-12 and IL-10 and reduced IL-6 mRNA expression in wild-type bone marrow-derived DC but not in CD103(-/-) bone marrow-derived DC. Similar mRNA patterns were seen in lungs of bleomycin-injured wild-type, but not CD103(-/-) or Mmp7(-/-), mice. 
<el> RU-486 <le> is a synthetic steroid analogue that can inhibit adrenal steroid synthesis in the rat and rhesus monkey. We measured the activities of five testicular and two ovarian microsomal steroidogenic enzymes to assess the potential effect of <el> RU-486 <le> on rat gonadal <re> steroidogenesis <er>. Hypophysectomized, gonadotropin-replaced rats received <el> RU-486 <le> or a vehicle solution twice daily for seven days. The animals were sacrificed and their gonads were resected, weighed, and microsomal enzyme activities were measured according to <el> RU-486 <le> treatment. Testicular 17-hydroxylase and aromatase activity decreased in <el> RU-486 <le> treated animals whereas 17,20-desmolase, 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 17-ketosteroid reductase activities were unaffected. Ovarian 17-hydroxylase but not 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity was decreased in the animals receiving the drug. 
Although epidemiological and biochemical evidence suggests that aluminium may be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is no convincing proof of a causal link for aluminium in disease progression. We have completed a two year, single-blind study to investigate whether the progression of <re> dementia <er> could be slowed by the trivalent ion chelator, <el> desferrioxamine <le>. 48 patients with probable AD were randomly assigned to receive <el> desferrioxamine <le> (125 mg intramuscularly twice daily, 5 days per week, for 24 months), oral placebo (lecithin), or no treatment. No significant differences in baseline measures of intelligence, memory, or speech ability existed between groups. Activities of daily living were assessed and videorecorded at 6, 12, 18, and 24 month intervals. There were no differences in the rate of deterioration of patients receiving either placebo or no treatment. Desferrioxamine treatment led to significant reduction in the rate of decline of daily living skills as assessed by both group means (p = 0.03) and variances (p less than 0.04). The mean rate of decline was twice as rapid for the no-treatment group. Appetite (n = 4) and weight (n = 1) loss were the only reported side-effects. 
Topological, chemical and immunological barriers are thought to limit infection by enteropathogenic bacteria. However, in many cases these barriers and their consequences for the infection process remain incompletely understood. Here, we employed a mouse model for Salmonella colitis and a mixed inoculum approach to identify barriers limiting the gut luminal pathogen population. Mice were infected via the oral route with wild type S. Typhimurium (S. <el> Tm <le>) and/or mixtures of phenotypically identical but differentially tagged S. <el> Tm <le> strains ("WITS", wild-type isogenic tagged strains), which can be individually tracked by quantitative real-time PCR. WITS dilution experiments identified a substantial loss in tag/genetic diversity within the gut luminal S. <el> Tm <le> population by days 2-4 post infection. The diversity-loss was not attributable to overgrowth by S. <el> Tm <le> mutants, but required <re> inflammation <er>, Gr-1+ cells (mainly neutrophilic granulocytes) and most likely NADPH-oxidase-mediated defense, but not iNOS. Mathematical modelling indicated that <re> inflammation <er> inflicts a bottleneck transiently restricting the gut luminal S. <el> Tm <le> population to approximately 6000 cells and plating experiments verified a transient, <re> inflammation <er>- and Gr-1+ cell-dependent dip in the gut luminal S. <el> Tm <le> population at day 2 post infection. 
African green monkeys (AGMs) infected with the AGM type of SIV (SIVagm) do not develop chronic immune activation and AIDS, despite viral loads similar to those detected in humans infected with HIV-1 and rhesus macaques (RMs) infected with the RM type of SIV (SIVmac). Because chronic immune activation drives progressive CD4+ T cell depletion and immune cell dysfunctions, factors that characterize disease progression, we sought to understand the molecular basis of this AGM phenotype. To this end, we longitudinally assessed the gene expression profiles of blood- and lymph node-derived CD4+ cells from AGMs and RMs in response to SIVagm and SIVmac <el> infection <le>, respectively, using a genomic microarray platform. The molecular signature of acute <el> infection <le> was characterized, in both species, by strong upregulation of type I IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). ISG expression returned to basal levels after postinfection day 28 in AGMs but was sustained in RMs, especially in the lymph node-derived cells. We also found that SIVagm induced <re> IFN-alpha <er> production by AGM cells in vitro and that low <re> IFN-alpha <er> levels were sufficient to induce strong ISG responses. 
Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) is increasingly used instead of bone marrow transplantation, particularly in HLA identical sibling pairs. Despite the presence of significantly increased numbers of T cells in the PBSC graft, acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is not increased. We have investigated whether granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (<el> G-CSF <le>) administration to PBSCT recipients, both with and without donor <el> G-CSF <le> pretreatment, further modulates acute GVHD in a murine model of PBSCT. Recipients of <el> G-CSF <le> mobilized splenocytes showed a significantly improved survival (P<0.001) and a reduction in GVHD score and serum LPS levels compared with control recipients. <el> G-CSF <le> treatment of donors, rather than recipients, had the most significant effect on reducing levels of tumor necrosis factor (<re> TNFalpha <er>) 7 days after transplantation. As a potential mechanism of the reduction in <re> TNFalpha <er>, we demonstrate <el> G-CSF <le> decreased dendritic cells <re> TNFalpha <er>, and interleukin-12 production to lipopolysaccharide. 
Stimulation of the basolateral Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase in the isolated perfused rabbit cortical collecting duct by raising either bath potassium or lumen sodium increases <re> potassium secretion <er>, sodium absorption and their apical conductances. Here we determined the effect of stimulating Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase on <re> potassium secretion <er> without luminal sodium transport. Acutely raising bath potassium concentrations from 2.5 to 8.5 mM, without luminal sodium, depolarized the basolateral membrane and transepithelial voltages while increasing the transepithelial, basolateral and apical membrane conductances of principal cells. Fractional apical membrane resistance and cell pH were elevated. Net <re> potassium secretion <er> was maintained albeit diminished and was still enhanced by raising bath potassium, but was reduced by basolateral ethylisopropylamiloride, an inhibitor of Na(+)/H(+) exchange. Luminal iberitoxin, a specific inhibitor of the calcium-activated big-conductance potassium (<el> BK <le>) channel, impaired <re> potassium secretion <er> both in the presence and absence of luminal sodium. In contrast, iberitoxin did not affect luminal sodium transport. 
The neurotoxicity of manganese [Mn] is due in part to glutamate excitotoxicity. Release of ATP by astrocytes is a critical modulator of glutamatergic neurotransmission, which is regulated by <re> calcium <er> (Ca(2+)) waves that propagate through astrocytic networks in response to synaptic activity. It was postulated that Mn alters ATP-dependent intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics in astrocytes, thereby suppressing Ca(2+) wave activity. Confluent primary cultures of cortical astrocytes were loaded with the Ca(2+)-sensitive dye fluo-4 and examined by fluorescence microscopy for Ca(2+) wave activity following micropipet mechanical stimulation of a single cell. Mitochondrial Ca(2+) was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy following addition of ATP using the mitochondrial-specific Ca(2+) dye rhod-2-AM. Imaging studies revealed that pretreatment of astrocytes with 1-10 microM Mn significantly reduced the rate, area, and amplitude of mechanically induced Ca(2+) waves. This attenuation was not a result of inhibited mitochondrial <re> calcium <er> uptake because robust <re> calcium <er> waves were still observed following pretreatment of astrocytes with Ru360, an inhibitor of mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake, either in coupling or uncoupling conditions. However, determination of endoplasmic reticulum (<el> ER <le>) Ca(2+) levels in cells using the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin indicated that Mn reduced the available pool of releasable <el> ER <le> Ca(2+) at concentrations as low as 1 muM. Examination of ATP-stimulated changes in mitochondrial Ca(2+) indicated that, in cells pretreated with Mn, mitochondria retained high levels of Ca(2+). 
Previous studies have shown that cerebral hypoxia results in increased activity of caspase-9 in the cytosolic fraction of the cerebral cortex of newborn piglets. The present study tests the hypothesis that hypoxia results in increased tyrosine <re> phosphorylation of procaspase-9 <er> and apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) and the hypoxia-induced increased tyrosine <re> phosphorylation of procaspase-9 <er> and Apaf-1 is mediated by nitric oxide. To test this hypothesis, 15 newborn piglets were divided into three groups: normoxic (Nx, n=5), hypoxic (Hx, n=5) and hypoxic treated with <el> nNOS <le> inhibitor I (Hx+<el> nNOS <le> I 0.4mg/kg, i.v., 30min prior to hypoxia) [16]. The hypoxic piglets were exposed to an FiO(2) of 0.06 for 1h. Tissue hypoxia was documented by ATP and phosphocreatine (PCr) levels. Cytosolic fractions were isolated and tyrosine phosphorylated procaspase-9 and Apaf-1 were determined by immunoblotting using specific anti-procaspase-9, anti-Apaf-1 and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. ATP levels (mumoles/g brain) were 4.3+/-0.2 in the Nx and 1.4+/-0.3 in the Hx and 1.7+/-0.3 in Hx+<el> nNOS <le> I group (p<0.05 vs. Nx) groups. PCr levels (mumoles/g brain) were 3.8+/-0.3 in the Nx and 0.9+/-0.2 in the Hx and 1.0+/-0.4 in the Hx+<el> nNOS <le> I (p<0.05 vs. Nx) group. Density (ODxmm(2)) of tyrosine phosphorylatd procaspase-9 was 412+/-8 in the Nx, 1286+/-12 in the Hx (p<0.05 vs. Nx) and 421+/-10 in the Hx+<el> nNOS <le> I (p<0.05 vs. Hx) group. Density of tyrosine phosphorylated Apaf-1 was 11.72+/-1.11 in Nx, 24.50+/-2.33 in Hx (p<0.05 vs. Nx) and 16.63+/-1.57 in Hx+<el> nNOS <le> I (p<0.05 vs. Hx) group. 
Osteosarcoma is the most common primary solid malignant bone tumor. Despite substantial improvements in surgery and chemotherapy, metastasis remains a major cause of fatal outcomes, and the molecular mechanisms of metastasis are still poorly understood. Hypoxia, which is common in malignant tumors including osteosarcoma, increases expressions of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9, and can induce invasiveness. As we previously showed a novel transcutaneous <el> CO2 <le> application to decrease HIF-1α expression and induce <re> apoptosis <er> in malignant fibrous histiocytoma, we hypothesize that transcutaneous <el> CO2 <le> application could suppress metastatic potential of osteosarcoma by improving hypoxic conditions. Here, we examined the effects of transcutaneous <el> CO2 <le> application on <re> apoptosis <er>, and development of pulmonary metastasis using a highly metastatic osteosarcoma cell line, LM8. Transcutaneous <el> CO2 <le> application significantly decreased tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis in LM8 cells. Apoptotic activity increased, and intratumoral hypoxia was improved with decreased expressions of HIF-1α, MMP-2 and MMP-9, significantly, in the <el> CO2 <le>-treated tumors. 
The involvement of <re> anion <er> channels in the mechanism of the acrosome reaction (AR) was investigated. The AR was induced by Ca2+ or by addition of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. The occurrence of AR was determined by following the release of acrosin from the cells. In order to investigate the role of <re> anion <er> channels in the AR, several <re> anion <er>-channel inhibitors were tested, mainly <el> DIDS <le> (4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid). Other blockers, like SITS (4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid), furosemide, probenecid and pyridoxal 5-phosphate, were also tested. We found that <el> DIDS <le> binds covalently to sperm plasma membrane in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Maximal binding occurs after 2 h with 0.3 mM <el> DIDS <le>. <el> DIDS <le> and SITS inhibit AR in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC50 of <el> DIDS <le> and SITS in the presence of A23187 is 0.15 and 0.22 mM, respectively. Tributyltin chloride (TBTC), an Cl-/OH- exchanger, partially overcomes <el> DIDS <le> inhibition of the AR. HCO3- is required for a maximal acrosin release and Ca(2+)-uptake, in the presence or absence of A23187. It is known that HCO3- activates adenylate cyclase and therefore, increases the intracellular level of cAMP. The inhibition of the AR by <el> DIDS <le> decreases from 95 to 50% when (dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) was added, i.e., HCO3- is no longer required while elevating the level of cAMP in an alternative way. Moreover, we show that the stimulatory effect of HCO3- on Ca(2+)-uptake is completely inhibited by <el> DIDS <le>. 
Serotoninergic neuronal networks are important for food intake and <el> body weight <le> regulation. However, the mechanisms by which some metabolic pathways are influenced are rather unclear. Dexfenfluramine (<re> DF <er>), a serotonin releaser and re-uptake inhibitor, was used to investigate changes in food intake, <el> body weight <le> development, energy expenditure, respiratory quotient and substrate oxidation rates for 12 days. Normal rats, receiving an energy-controlled mash diet and water ad libitum were intraperitoneally injected daily with either saline, 1, 2.5, 5 or 10 mg <re> DF <er>/kg. Compared to controls, food intake, <el> body weight <le> development and energy expenditure were decreased in a dose-dependent manner, especially during the first six days. Lipid oxidation was increased while oxidation of carbohydrates was decreased. Pair-feeding experiments over three days revealed that this was a clear pharmacological effect and not simply a result of diminished food intake. At the end of these experiments, plasma glucose and liver and muscle glycogen were unchanged after <re> DF <er>, but isoleucine, leucine and lysine were significantly decreased in plasma and liver. Therefore, the plasma tryptophan/large neutral amino acids ratio was slightly increased. Protein oxidation was unchanged after <re> DF <er>. 
Mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (<el> MAPK <le>/ERK) is a key molecule in intracellular signal transducing pathways that transport extracellular stimuli from cell surface to nuclei. <el> MAPK <le>/ERK has been revealed to be involved in the physiological proliferation of mammalian cells and also to potentiate them to transform. However, its role in the outgrowth of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has yet to be clarified. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the activation of <el> MAPK <le>/ERK and its associated gene expression in HCC. <el> MAPK <le>/ERK was activated in 15 of 26 cases of HCC we examined (58%), and its activity level was significantly higher in HCC than in the adjacent non-cancerous lesions. Besides, <el> MAPK <le>/ERK activation in HCC was positively correlated with protein expression of transcription factor c-Fos. Furthermore, in 25 of 26 cases of HCC which genomic DNA was available, 22 cases without genomic DNA amplification exhibited positive correlation, not only between protein expression of c-Fos and <re> cyclin <er> D1, but also between <el> MAPK <le>/ERK activation and <re> cyclin <er> D1 expression. Concerning the relationship between <el> MAPK <le>/ERK activation and the clinicohistopathological features of HCC, the tumor (HCC) versus non-tumor (non-cancerous counterpart) ratio (T/N) of <el> MAPK <le>/ERK activity was positively correlated with tumor size, but neither with the stage of HCC nor the degree of differentiation of HCC. 
We previously reported that <el> IL-1 <le>beta and the decoy receptor for <el> IL-1 <le> (<el> IL-1 <le>RII) are expressed by intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) during detachment-induced cell death, or "anoikis." We now investigated whether <el> IL-1 <le> regulates anoikis. Skewing the balance in favor of <el> IL-1 <le>, by blocking <el> IL-1 <le>RII or by adding <el> IL-1 <le>beta to detached rat IEC-18 cells, reduced cell death. The protective effect of anti-<el> IL-1 <le>RII was reversed by blocking <el> IL-1 <le>beta, confirming the anti-apoptotic effect was due to endogenous <el> IL-1 <le>beta. Added <el> IL-1 <le>beta also rescued cells from anoikis and was associated with considerable aggregation of the detached cells. Aggregate formation and the anti-apoptotic effect of added <el> IL-1 <le>beta were prevented by blocking E-cadherin, indicating that <el> IL-1 <le> promoted aggregation and indirectly, survival. On the other hand, treating detached cells with <el> IL-1 <le>beta and an anti-beta(1) <re> integrin <er> antibody abolished the protective effect of <el> IL-1 <le>beta but not the aggregates. 
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a pivotal role in tissue remodeling and destruction in inflammation-associated diseases such as cardiovascular disease and periodontal disease. Although it is known that interleukin (IL)-6 is a key proinflamatory cytokine, it remains unclear how IL-6 regulates MMP expression by mononuclear phagocytes. Furthermore, it remains undetermined how IL-6 in combination with hyperglycemia affects MMP expression. In the present study, we investigated the regulatory effect of IL-6 alone or in combination with high <el> glucose <le> on <re> MMP-1 expression <er> by U937 mononuclear phagocytes. We found that IL-6 is a powerful stimulator for <re> MMP-1 expression <er> and high <el> glucose <le> further augmented IL-6-stimulated <re> MMP-1 expression <er>. We also found that high <el> glucose <le>, IL-6, and lipopolysaccharide act in concert to stimulate <re> MMP-1 expression <er>. In the studies to elucidate underlying mechanisms, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways were found to be required for stimulation of MMP-1 by IL-6 and high <el> glucose <le>. We also observed that IL-6 and high <el> glucose <le> stimulated the expression of c-Jun, a key subunit of AP-1 known to be essential for MMP-1 transcription. The role of c-Jun in <re> MMP-1 expression <er> was confirmed by the finding that suppression of c-Jun expression by RNA interference significantly inhibited <re> MMP-1 expression <er>. Finally, we demonstrated that similarly to U937 mononuclear phagocytes, IL-6 and high <el> glucose <le> also stimulated MMP-1 secretion from human primary monocytes. 
The discovery of uncoupling protein (UCP)-2, a ubiquitously expressed protein homologous to UCP-1, has raised the possibility that energy balance of cells might be regulated in tissues other than brown adipocytes. In normal pancreatic islets, UCP-2 is upregulated by leptin and is low in leptin-resistant islets of ZDF rats. To determine whether UCP-2 does, in fact, have uncoupling activity and, if so, whether such activity would favorably influence the abnormalities in leptin-unresponsive UCP-2-underexpressing islets of diabetic ZDF rats, we transferred the UCP-2 gene to the islets of diabetic ZDF rats and lean (+/+) ZDF control rats. Although ATP was reduced by 23% in both groups of islets, the ATP:ADP ratio increased by 42 and 141%, respectively. [3H]palmitate oxidation was increased by 50%, and [3H]<el> glucose <le> oxidation was 42-63% higher. Preproinsulin mRNA was 2.9-fold above control levels, and <el> glucose <le>-stimulated <re> insulin secretion <er>, which was negligible in control ZDF rat islets, was improved in UCP-2-overexpressing islets. The high fat content of the islets was not reduced, however. 
The in vivo effects of <el> berberine <le> (BBR), the widely used bioactive herbal ingredient from many traditional Chinese medicinal herbs, on the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine (CBZ, a substrate of CYP3A) and its metabolite carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide (ECBZ), digoxin (DIG, a substrate of P-gp) and <re> cyclosporine <er> A (CsA, a dual substrate of CYP3A and P-gp) were evaluated in rats. After a 2-week pretreatment with BBR, the pharmacokinetic parameters of i.g. administered CBZ and ECBZ were not significantly altered. The pharmacokinetics of i.v. administered DIG was not modified by single and 2-week pretreatments with BBR, but a dose-dependent increase in AUC and C(max) was observed in the i.g. administered DIG parameters in rats. The AUCs of DIG with BBR (30 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg) were 133%, 170% (single) and 123%, 169% (2-week) of control, respectively. The AUC and C(max) of i.g. administered CsA with a 2-week pretreatment with BBR increased by 62% and 43% (BBR 30 mg/kg, p < 0.05), 96% and 60% (BBR 100 mg/kg, p < 0.01), compared with the control. 
We hypothesized that the more-pronounced hypotensive and bradycardic effects of an antiorthostatic posture change from seated to supine than water immersion are caused by hydrostatic carotid baroreceptor stimulation. Ten seated healthy males underwent five interventions of 15-min each of 1) posture change to supine, 2) seated water immersion to the Xiphoid process (WI), 3) seated neck suction (<el> NS <le>), 4) WI with simultaneous neck suction (-22 mmHg) adjusted to simulate the carotid hydrostatic pressure increase during supine (WI + <el> NS <le>), and 5) seated control. Left atrial diameter increased similarly during supine, WI + <el> NS <le>, and WI and was unchanged during control and <el> NS <le>. Mean arterial pressure (<re> MAP <er>) decreased the most during supine (7 +/- 1 mmHg, P < 0.05) and less during WI + <el> NS <le> (4 +/- 1 mmHg) and <el> NS <le> (3 +/- 1 mmHg). The decrease in heart rate (HR) by 13 +/- 1 beats/min (P < 0.05) and the increase in arterial pulse pressure (PP) by 17 +/- 4 mmHg (P < 0.05) during supine was more pronounced (P < 0.05) than during WI + <el> NS <le> (10 +/- 2 beats/min and 7 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively) and WI (8 +/- 2 beats/min and 6 +/- 1 mmHg, respectively, P < 0.05). Plasma vasopressin decreased only during supine and WI, and plasma norepinephrine, in addition, decreased during WI + <el> NS <le> (P < 0.05). 
Standard first-line treatment for elderly multiple myeloma (MM) patients ineligible for stem cell transplantation is melphalan plus prednisone (MP). However, complete responses (<re> CR <er>s) are rare. Bortezomib is active in patients with relapsed MM, including elderly patients. This phase 1/2 trial in 60 untreated MM patients aged at least 65 years (half older than 75 years) was designed to determine dosing, safety, and efficacy of <el> bortezomib <le> plus MP (VMP). VMP response rate was 89%, including 32% immunofixation-negative <re> CR <er>s, of whom half of the IF- <re> CR <er> patients analyzed achieved immunophenotypic remission (no detectable plasma cells at 10(-4) to 10(-5) sensitivity). VMP appeared to overcome the poor prognosis conferred by retinoblastoma gene deletion and IgH translocations. Results compare favorably with our historical control data for MP--notably, response rate (89% versus 42%), event-free survival at 16 months (83% versus 51%), and survival at 16 months (90% versus 62%). Side effects were predictable and manageable; principal toxicities were hematologic, gastrointestinal, and peripheral neuropathy and were more evident during early cycles and in patients aged 75 years or more. 
Hedgehog interacting protein (<el> Hhip <le>) is essential for islet formation and beta-cell proliferation during pancreatic development; abnormally elevated <el> Hhip <le> expression has been linked to human pancreatitis. Here, we investigate the role of <el> Hhip <le> in modulating insulin secretion in adult <el> Hhip <le> mice (<el> Hhip <le> +/- vs. <el> Hhip <le>+/+) fed high fat diets (HFD). Both sexes of HFD-<el> Hhip <le> +/+ mice developed impaired glucose intolerance, that was only ameliorated in male HFD-<el> Hhip <le> +/- mice that had high levels of circulating plasma insulin, but not in female HFD-<el> Hhip <le> +/- mice. HFD stimulated <el> Hhip <le> <re> gene expression <er>, mainly in beta cells. Male HFD-<el> Hhip <le> +/+ mice had more large islets in which insulin content was reduced; islet architecture was disordered; and markers of oxidative stress (8-OHdG and Nox 2) were increased. In contrast, male HFD-<el> Hhip <le> +/- mice had more small islets with increased beta cell proliferation, enhanced GSIS, less oxidative stress and preserved islet integrity. In vitro, recombinant <el> Hhip <le> increased Nox2 and NADPH activity and decreased insulin-positive beta cells. siRNA-<el> Hhip <le> increased GSIS and abolished the stimulation of sodium palmitate (PA)-BSA on Nox2 <re> gene expression <er>. 
Neural precursor cell expressed and developmentally downregulated 4-2 protein (Nedd4-2) facilitates the endocytosis of epithelial Na channels (<el> ENaC <le>s). Both mice and humans with a loss of regulation of <el> ENaC <le> by Nedd4-2 have salt-induced hypertension. <el> ENaC <le> is also expressed in the brain, where it is critical for hypertension on a high-salt diet in salt-sensitive rats. In the present studies we assessed whether Nedd4-2 knockout (-/-) mice have the following: (1) increased brain <el> ENaC <le>; (2) elevated cerebrospinal fluid (<re> CSF <er>) sodium on a high-salt diet; and (3) enhanced pressor responses to <re> CSF <er> sodium and hypertension on a high-salt diet, both mediated by brain <el> ENaC <le>. Prominent choroid plexus and neuronal <el> ENaC <le> staining was present in -/- but not in wild-type mice. In chronically instrumented mice, ICV infusion of Na-rich artificial <re> CSF <er> increased mean arterial pressure 3-fold higher in -/- than in wild-type mice. ICV infusion of the <el> ENaC <le> blocker benzamil abolished this enhancement. In telemetered -/- mice on a high-salt diet (8% NaCl), <re> CSF <er> [Na(+)], mean arterial pressure, and heart rate increased significantly, mean arterial pressure by 30 to 35 mmHg. These mean arterial pressure and heart rate responses were largely prevented by ICV benzamil but only to a minor extent by SC benzamil at the ICV rate. 
A number of lines of evidence have suggested a possible involvement of the mitosis-promoting protein kinase <el> Cdc2 <le> in the process of apoptotic cell death, and one recent study concluded that premature activation of <el> Cdc2 <le> is required for <re> apoptosis <er>. Here we have used a temperature-sensitive murine <el> Cdc2 <le> mutant cell line and <el> Cdc2 <le> inhibitor compounds to study the effect of inhibition of this protein kinase on <re> apoptosis <er> induced by DNA-damaging drugs. Inhibition of <el> Cdc2 <le> activity before or during exposure to DNA strand break-inducing drugs had the effect of increasing the level of subsequent <re> apoptosis <er>, as assessed by electron microscopy and flow cytometry. 
Nitric oxide (NO) is a crucial mediator of hindlimb collateralization and angiogenesis. Within tissues there are nitrosyl-heme proteins which have the potential to generate NO under conditions of hypoxia or low pH. Low level irradiation of blood and muscle with light in the far red/near infrared spectrum (670 nm, <el> R/NIR <le>) facilitates NO release. Therefore, we assessed the impact of red light exposure on the stimulation of femoral artery collateralization. Rabbits and mice underwent unilateral resection of the femoral artery and chronic <el> R/NIR <le> treatment. The direct NO scavenger carboxy-PTIO and the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NAME were also administered in the presence of <el> R/NIR <le>. DAF fluorescence assessed <el> R/NIR <le> changes in <re> NO levels <er> within endothelial cells. In vitro measures of <el> R/NIR <le> induced angiogenesis were assessed by endothelial cell proliferation and migration. <el> R/NIR <le> significantly increased collateral vessel number which could not be attenuated with L-NAME. <el> R/NIR <le> induced collateralization was abolished with c-PTIO. In vitro, NO production increased in endothelial cells with <el> R/NIR <le> exposure, and this finding was independent of NOS inhibition. Similarly <el> R/NIR <le> induced proliferation and tube formation in a NO dependent manner. Finally, nitrite supplementation accelerated <el> R/NIR <le> collateralization in wild type C57Bl/6 mice. In an eNOS deficient transgenic mouse model, <el> R/NIR <le> restores collateral development. 
The transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) is a key regulator of inflammatory processes in reactive glial cells. We utilized a transgenic mouse model (<el> GFAP <le>-IkappaBalpha-dn) where the classical NF-kappaB pathway is inactivated by overexpression of a dominant negative (dn) form of the inhibitor of kappa B (IkappaBalpha) in glial fibrillary acidic protein (<el> GFAP <le>)-expressing cells, which include astrocytes, Schwann cells, and satellite cells of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and sought to determine whether glial NF-kappaB inhibition leads to a reduction in <re> pain <er> behavior and inflammation following chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve. As expected, following CCI nuclear translocation, and hence activation, of NF-kappaB was detected only in the sciatic nerve of wild type (WT) mice, and not in <el> GFAP <le>-IkappaBalpha-dn mice, while upregulation of <el> GFAP <le> was observed in the sciatic nerve and DRGs of both WT and <el> GFAP <le>-IkappaBalpha-dn mice, indicative of glial activation. Following CCI, mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia were reduced in <el> GFAP <le>-IkappaBalpha-dn mice compared to those in WT, as well as gene and protein expression of CCL2, CCR2 and CXCL10 in the sciatic nerve. Additionally, gene expression of TNF, CCL2, and CCR2 was reduced in the DRGs of transgenic mice compared to those of WT after CCI. 
Zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP) inhibits production of carbon monoxide (CO) but not nitric oxide (<re> NO <er>) synthase activity in vitro, therefore, it has been used to discriminate the effects of these activators of cyclic GMP production. However, intracellular enzyme activity is supported by endogenous substrates and cofactors, therefore, in vitro experiments with an optimal supply of these substances do not necessarily represent the intracellular circumstances. The present study was conducted to examine whether ZnPP affects <re> NO <er> production in rat cerebellar slices. Incubation with 1-aminocyclopentane-trans-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (<el> ACPD <le>) increased the conversion of [3H]-L-arginine into [3H]-citrulline in the slices. ZnPP at I microM, not only suppressed the <el> ACPD <le>-dependent production of [3H]-citrulline but also reduced the basal [3H]-citrulline level, accumulation of [3H]-L-arginine and ATP content in the slices, but ZnPP at 1 microM did not affect the catalytic activity of partially purified <re> NO <er> synthases in vitro. In contrast, a selective inhibitor of <re> NO <er> synthase, N omega(-)nitro-L-arginine, inhibited <el> ACPD <le>-dependent [3H]-citrulline production without affecting the basal [3H]-citrulline level or [3H]-L-arginine accumulation. These results indicate that ZnPP suppresses No production through a loss of its precursor, even at concentrations exhibiting no inhibition of the catalytic activity of <re> NO <er> synthase. 
Paclitaxel is a treatment option for advanced or metastatic bladder cancer after the failure of first-line cisplatin and gemcitabine, although resistance limits its clinical benefits. Mcl-1 is an anti-apoptotic protein that promotes resistance to paclitaxel in different tumors. Obatoclax, a BH3 mimetic of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, antagonizes Mcl-1 and hence may reverse paclitaxel resistance in Mcl-1-overexpressing tumors. In this study, paclitaxel-sensitive 5637 and -resistant HT1197 bladder cancer cells were treated with paclitaxel, <el> obatoclax <le>, or combinations of both. Apoptosis, cell cycle, and autophagy were measured by Western blot, flow cytometry, and fluorescence microscopy. Moreover, Mcl-1 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in bladder carcinoma tissues. Our results confirmed that paclitaxel alone induced Mcl-1 downregulation and <re> apoptosis <er> in 5637, but not in HT1197 cells; however, combinations of <el> obatoclax <le> and paclitaxel sensitized HT1197 cells to the treatment. In <el> obatoclax <le>-treated 5637 and <el> obatoclax <le> + paclitaxel-treated HT1197 cells, the blockade of the autophagic flux correlated with <re> apoptosis <er> and was associated with caspase-dependent cleavage of beclin-1. Obatoclax alone delayed the cell cycle in 5637, but not in HT1197 cells, whereas combinations of both retarded the cell cycle and reduced mitotic slippage. 
MicroRNAs are small endogenous noncoding RNAs that regulate protein expression by hybridization to imprecise complementary sequences of target mRNAs. Changes in abundance of muscle-specific microRNA, miR-1, have been implicated in cardiac disease, including arrhythmia and heart failure. However, the specific molecular targets and cellular mechanisms involved in the action of miR-1 in the heart are only beginning to emerge. In this study we investigated the effects of increased expression of miR-1 on excitation-contraction coupling and Ca(2+) cycling in rat ventricular myocytes using methods of electrophysiology, Ca(2+) imaging and quantitative immunoblotting. Adenoviral-mediated overexpression of miR-1 in myocytes resulted in a marked increase in the amplitude of the inward Ca(2+) current, flattening of Ca(2+) transients voltage dependence, and enhanced frequency of spontaneous Ca(2+) sparks while reducing the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) content as compared with control. In the presence of isoproterenol, rhythmically paced, miR-1-overexpressing myocytes exhibited spontaneous arrhythmogenic oscillations of intracellular Ca(2+), events that occurred rarely in control myocytes under the same conditions. The effects of miR-1 were completely reversed by the CaMKII inhibitor KN93. Although phosphorylation of phospholamban was not altered, miR-1 overexpression increased phosphorylation of the ryanodine receptor (<el> RyR2 <le>) at S2814 (Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase) but not at S2808 (protein kinase A). Overexpression of miR-1 was accompanied by a selective decrease in expression of the protein phosphatase <re> PP2A <er> regulatory subunit B56alpha involved in <re> PP2A <er> targeting to specialized subcellular domains. 
Immobilization stress upregulates c-<re> Fos expression <er> in several CNS areas. Repeated stress or the use of drugs can modulate stress-induced c-<re> Fos expression <er>. Here, we investigated in 40 different areas of the rat brain the effects of dexamethasone (SDX, a synthetic glucocorticoid), diazepam (SBDZ, a benzodiazepine), and <el> imipramine <le> (IMI, an antidepressant) on the c-<re> Fos expression <er> induced by restraint stress. Wistar rats were divided into four groups and submitted to 20 days of daily injection of saline (three first groups) or <el> imipramine <le>, 15 mg/kg, i.p. On day 21, animals were submitted to injections of saline (somatosensory, SS), SDX (1 mg/kg, i.p.), SBDZ (5 mg/kg, i.p.), or IMI (15 mg/kg, i.p.) before being submitted to restraint. Immediately after stress, the animals were perfused and their brains processed with immunohistochemistry for c-Fos (Ab-5 Oncogene Science). Dexamethasone reduced stress-induced c-<re> Fos expression <er> in SS cortex, hippocampus, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), and locus coeruleus (LC), whereas diazepam reduced c-Fos staining in the SS cortex, hippocampus, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, septal area, and hypothalamus (preoptic area and supramammillary nucleus). Chronic administration of <el> imipramine <le> decreased staining in the hippocampus, PVH, and LC, while increasing it in the nucleus raphe pallidus. 
Vascular <re> inflammation <er> is present in a subset of patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and has a major influence in determining the disease manifestations. Radiological characterization of this subset is particularly important to achieve early recognition and treatment. We conducted this study to investigate the role of imaging in differentiating CAA with and without <re> inflammation <er>. We reviewed neuroimaging findings for 54 patients seen at Mayo Clinic over 25 years with pathological evidence of CAA and with available neuroimaging at the time of diagnosis. Clinical data were also recorded. Patients were grouped into CAA alone (no vascular <re> inflammation <er>), Aβ-related angiitis or ABRA (angiodestructive <re> inflammation <er>), and CAA-related <re> inflammation <er> or CAA-RI (perivascular <re> inflammation <er>). Imaging findings at presentation were compared among patient subgroups. Radiological features supporting a diagnosis of ABRA or CAA-RI were identified. Radiologic findings at diagnosis were available in 27 patients with CAA without <re> inflammation <er>, 22 with ABRA, and 5 with CAA-RI. On MRI, leptomeningeal disease alone or with infiltrative white matter was significantly more frequent at presentation in patients with ABRA or CAA-RI compared with those with CAA (29.6% vs. 3.7%, P = 0.02; and 40.7% vs. 3.7%, P = 0.002, respectively), whereas lobar <el> hemorrhage <le> was more frequent in patients with CAA (62.3% vs. 7.4%, P = 0.0001). Overall, leptomeningeal involvement at presentation was present in 70.4% of patients with ABRA or CAA-RI and in only 7.4% of patients with CAA (P = 0.0001). The sensitivity and specificity of leptomeningeal enhancement to identify patients with ABRA or CAA-RI were 70.4% and 92.6%, respectively, whereas the positive likelihood ratio (LR) was 9.5. The sensitivity and specificity of intracerebral <el> hemorrhage <le> to identify patients with CAA were 62.9% and 92.6%, respectively, whereas the positive LR was 8.5. Microbleeds were found in 70.4% of patients with inflammatory CAA at presentation. 
There is a difference between the sheep and rat somatotrophs in the response to growth hormone-releasing peptide-2 (GHRP-2), which raises the question of what the response may be in human somatotrophs. In the present study, cells were obtained from seven human acromegalic tumours and the effects of GHRP-2 were studied. Cells were dissociated and kept in primary culture for 1-3 weeks before experimentation. Application of GHRP-2 for 30 min induced a significant increase in <re> GH secretion <er> from the cultured cells from all seven tumours whereas human GH-releasing hormone (hGHRH) at a dose of 10 nM induced a significant GH release in only four of seven tumours. The intracellular levels of cAMP in all seven tumours were significantly increased by both 10 nM GHRP-2 and <el> GHRH <le>, but the response to <el> GHRH <le> was significantly higher than the response to GHRP-2. The adenylyl cyclase inhibitor, MDL 12330A, blocked the effect of <el> GHRH <le> and GHRP-2 on intracellular cAMP levels, whereas the Ca2+ channel blocker Co2+ (0.5 mM) did not attenuate the cAMP response. For the tumours in which <re> GH secretion <er> was increased by <el> GHRH <le> and GHRP-2, the cAMP antagonist Rp-cAMP blocked the GH response to <el> GHRH <le> but not to GHRP-2. When a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor (H89) was applied, <el> GHRH <le> stimulated GH release was blocked, but cAMP accumulation was not affected. The response to GHRP-2 was not altered by H89. Calphostin C [a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor] reduced the effect of GHRP-2 on the secretion of GH but did not affect the response to <el> GHRH <le>. Both <el> GHRH <le> and GHRP-2 increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in a concentration-dependent manner. 
The growth of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells was inhibited by <el> retinoic acid <le> after 16 h of treatment. However, the growth of all cell lines except one became refractory to <el> retinoic acid <le> after 48 h of exposure. The expression of the hyperphosphorylated retinoblastoma protein species (RB p110) was observed to be increased fivefold to tenfold in NSCLC cells within 16 h of exposure to <el> retinoic acid <le>. In the H460a and H226b cell lines, p110 showed some conversion to the underphosphorylated p105 form after 24 h of <el> retinoic acid <le> treatment. After 48 h, p105 became the predominant form, along with a 60K M(r) species. After 72 h, expression of all RB protein species became almost undetectable in H460a and H226b cells, concomitant with increases in cell growth rates. A different pattern of RB expression was observed in the H322j and H358 cell lines. In these cells, both p110 and p105 were induced within 8 h of <el> retinoic acid <le> treatment. Furthermore, the elevated levels and the phosphorylation state of RB in <el> retinoic acid <le>-treated H322j and H358 cells remained essentially unchanged for up to 72 h and only low amounts of the 60K M(r) species were detected. I believe that a post-translational mechanism is responsible for the <el> retinoic acid <le>-mediated induction of RB, since <re> levels of RB <er> mRNA remained relatively unchanged during the time course of <el> retinoic acid <le> exposure. 
We studied the effect of cardiac <el> ischemia <le> on sarcolemmal enzymes, <re> Na <er>+-Ca2+ exchange, Ca2+ binding, and Ca2+ efflux in the newborn and adult rabbit. Rabbit ventricle was made ischemic by incubation in hypoxic, glucose-free Tyrode solution at 37 degrees C for 60-120 min. Ischemia inhibited <re> Na <er>+-K+-ATPase and K+-p-nitrophenylphosphatase (PNPPase) activity in the adult myocardium more than in the newborn. In the oxygenated (control) hearts, <re> Na <er>+-Ca2+-exchange activity in the newborn sarcolemma [Michaelis constant (Km) 18 microM; maximum velocity (Vmax) 33] was similar to that in the adult (Km = 16 microM, Vmax = 32). After 60 min <el> ischemia <le>, however, <re> Na <er>+-Ca2+ exchange in the newborn (Km = 16 microM, Vmax = 18) was inhibited less than in the adult (Km = 25 microM, Vmax = 18). In the two age groups, Ca2+ binding and efflux rate were not increased after <el> ischemia <le>, which suggested that Ca2+ permeability did not increase during <el> ischemia <le>. 
1. The effects of isosorbiddinitrate (<el> ISDN <le>) were tested on membrane currents and resting potential in Xenopus laevis oocytes which were either uninjected or injected with cRNA encoding for K+ channels from three distinct families (slowly activating IsK channels, delayed-rectifying Kv1.1 or inwardly rectifying IRK1 K+ channels). 2. In uninjected oocytes <el> ISDN <le> (1 mM) resulted in a decrease of the holding current at potentials more positive than -100 mV and in an increase at potentials below -100 mV. Increasing extracellular K+ to 100 mM shifted the reversal potential for <el> ISDN <le>-mediated effects to approximately -12 mV, suggesting an inhibition of a <re> K+ conductance <er> by <el> ISDN <le>. 3. In current clamp studies <el> ISDN <le> (1 mM) and Ba2+ (3 mM) depolarized cell membrane. <el> ISDN <le> and Ba2+ had no additive effects on membrane potential when applied simultaneously. In voltage clamp studies, corresponding results were observed for the effects of <el> ISDN <le> and Ba2+ on the holding current with an apparent K(m) of 0.21 and 0.08 mM, respectively. 4. In contrast to <el> ISDN <le>, the nitric oxide (NO) donors isosorbidmononitrate (ISMN) and S-nitrosocysteine (SNOC) had no effects on the holding currents in Xenopus oocytes. Moreover, the guanylate inhibitor LY 83583 did not affect <el> ISDN <le>-mediated holding current alterations, suggesting that <el> ISDN <le> acts independently of the second messenger NO. 5. <el> ISDN <le> inhibited exogenously expressed IsK channels with an apparent K(m) of 0.15 mM, but at 1 mM only weakly inhibited Kv1.1 and IRK1 channels. 6. 
The effects of added <el> ascorbic acid <le> and particle size on <re> iron <er> absorption from ferric pyrophosphate were evaluated in adult women (9-10 women/study) based on erythrocyte incorporation of <re> iron <er> stable isotopes (57Fe or 58Fe) 14 days after administration. Three separate studies were made with test meals of <re> iron <er>-fortified infant cereal (5 mg <re> iron <er>/meal) and the results are presented as geometric means and relative bioavailability values (RBV, FeSO4 = 100%). The results of study 1 showed that <re> iron <er> absorption was significantly lower from ferric pyrophosphate (mean particle size 8.5 microm) than from FeSO4 in meals without <el> ascorbic acid <le> (0.9 vs. 2.6%, p < 0.0001, RBV 36%) and in the same meals with <el> ascorbic acid <le> added at a 4:1 molar ratio relative to fortification <re> iron <er> (2.3 vs. 9.7%, p < 0.0001, RBV 23%). Ascorbic acid increased <re> iron <er> absorption from ferric pyrophosphate slightly less (2.6-fold) than from FeSO4 (3.7-fold) (p < 0.05). In studies 2 and 3, RBV of ferric pyrophosphate with an average particle size of 6.7 microm and 12.5 pm was not significantly different at 52 and 42% (p > 0.05), respectively. 
Transforming growth factor beta (<el> TGFbeta <le>) interacts with cell surface receptors to initiate a signaling cascade critical in regulating growth, differentiation, and development of many cell types. <el> TGFbeta <le> signaling involves activation of Smad proteins which directly regulate target gene expression. Here we show that Smad proteins also regulate gene expression by using a previously unrecognized pathway involving direct interaction with protein kinase A (<re> PKA <er>). <re> PKA <er> has numerous effects on growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, and activation of <re> PKA <er> is generally initiated by increased cellular cyclic AMP (cAMP). 
Phorbol esters exert diverse effects on cellular activation and differentiation. <re> CD <er> 7, a differentiation antigen appearing early in T cell ontogeny, may be involved in the activation and differentiation processes. <re> CD <er> 7 was found to be rapidly down-regulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (<el> TPA <le>) from mature T cell surface. The time course of <re> CD <er> 7 down-regulation was similar to that of other functionally important T cell antigens, <re> CD <er> 3 and <re> CD <er> 4. Within 2 h, <el> TPA <le> at 10 to 30 ng/ml induced a complete down-regulation of <re> CD <er> 7. Twenty-four hours later, the reappearance of <re> CD <er> 7 on <el> TPA <le>-treated cells was observed. This phenomenon was monocyte independent. In contrast, <re> CD <er> 7 expression on thymocytes was resistant to the effect of <el> TPA <le>. In addition, certain leukemic T cells were also resistant to <el> TPA <le>-induced <re> CD <er> 7 down-regulation. The mechanism underlying <el> TPA <le>-induced <re> CD <er> 7 down-regulation was investigated further. Synthetic diacylglycerol, sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol, which activates protein kinase C, did not induce down-regulation of <re> CD <er> 7 on mature T cells. Ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, did not down-regulate this antigen either. 
The involvement of NADPH oxidase in hypoxic pulmonary <re> vasoconstriction <er> (HPV) was investigated in buffer-perfused rabbit lungs, employing the inhibitors diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) and apocynin. Responses to the vasoconstrictors U-46619 and angiotensin II (ANG II) were used to test specificity. Lung nitric oxide (NO) generation was assessed by on-line monitoring of NO exhalation (chemiluminescence), and the efficacy of DPI and apocynin on the NADPH oxidase-dependent O2- generation was quantified in alveolar macrophages by fluorescent-activated cell sorter technique. In a concentration range between 1 and 5 mM, apocynin inhibited macrophage respiratory burst and HPV but similarly suppressed U-46619-induced vasoconstrictor responses. DPI inhibited macrophage O2- generation in concentrations > or = 0.5 microM. At doses between 0.5 and 1.5 microM, DPI blocked lung NO generation, thereby increasing HPV. At higher doses (4 microM), in contrast, DPI fully blocked the <el> hypoxia <le>-induced pressor responses, whereas the vasoconstrictor responses to U-46619 and [Asn1, Val5] ANG II were not diminished. In the presence of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, used to block lung NO generation throughout, DPI exhibited only the monophasic selective inhibition of HPV. 
PPARgamma agonists, such as <el> pioglitazone <le>, are widely used in the treatment of diabetes and several further disorders. They enhance transcription of the serum and glucocorticoid inducible kinase <re> SGK1 <er>, which could in turn enhance gastric acid secretion by stimulating KCNQ1 K+ channels. The present study explored whether <el> pioglitazone <le> upregulates <re> SGK1 <er> protein expression in gastric glands and thus modifies gastric acid secretion. Food containing the PPARgamma agonist <el> pioglitazone <le> (approximately 25 mg/kg bw/day) was administered to gene-targeted mice lacking <re> SGK1 <er> (sgk1-/-, n=11) and their wild-type littermates (sgk1+/+, n=11). Western blotting was employed to analyze <re> SGK1 <er> expression, BCECF-fluorescence to determine acid secretion in isolated gastric glands and immunohistochemistry to elucidate KCNQ1 and H+/K+-ATPase protein abundance in the parietal cell membrane. Pioglitazone significantly increased <re> SGK1 <er> expression. Cytosolic pH and cellular buffer capacity were not significantly different between sgk1+/+ and sgk1-/- mice and not significantly modified in either genotype by <el> pioglitazone <le>. Without <el> pioglitazone <le> treatment, Na+-independent pH-recovery following an ammonium pulse (DeltapH/min) reflecting H+/K+-ATPase activity was again similar in sgk1+/+ and sgk1-/- mice. Pioglitazone significantly increased DeltapH/min (approximately 3 fold) in sgk1+/+ but not in sgk1-/- mice. H+/K+-ATPase inhibitor omeprazole (100 microM) abolished DeltapH/min in both genotypes irrespective of <el> pioglitazone <le> treatment. Increase in local K+ concentrations to 35 mM (replacing Na+/NMDG) significantly increased DeltapH/min and abrogated the differences between genotypes. KCNQ1 and H+/K+-ATPase protein abundance in the parietal cell membrane was enhanced by <el> pioglitazone <le> treatment in sgk1+/+ but not in sgk1-/- mice. 
Interaction of rapidly evolving molecules imparts species specificity to sperm-egg recognition in marine invertebrates, but it is unclear whether comparable interactions occur during fertilization in any vertebrate species. In mammals, the sperm acrosomal protein <el> zonadhesin <le> is a rapidly evolving molecule with species-specific binding activity for the egg zona pellucida (ZP). Here we show using null mice produced by targeted disruption of Zan that <el> zonadhesin <le> confers species specificity to sperm-ZP <re> adhesion <er>. Sperm capacitation selectively exposed a partial von Willebrand D domain of mouse <el> zonadhesin <le> on the surface of living, motile cells. Antibodies to the exposed domain inhibited <re> adhesion <er> of wild-type spermatozoa to the mouse ZP but did not inhibit <re> adhesion <er> of spermatozoa lacking <el> zonadhesin <le>. Zan(-/-) males were fertile, and their spermatozoa readily fertilized mouse eggs in vitro. Remarkably, however, loss of <el> zonadhesin <le> increased <re> adhesion <er> of mouse spermatozoa to pig, cow, and rabbit ZP but not mouse ZP. 
To study the interdependence between gastric histamine release and acid secretion, we examined the effects of <el> gastrin <le>-(1-17) [G-(1-17)] or cholecystokinin-(1-33) [CCK-(1-33)] alone or combined with the <el> gastrin <le> (CCK-B) antagonist L365,260 or the CCK-A antagonist L364,718 in the isolated vascularly perfused rat stomach. G-(1-17) and CCK-(1-33) gave concentration-dependent increases in acid secretion and histamine release. Gastrin or CCK-A antagonist alone did not stimulate histamine release or acid secretion. Maximally G-(1-17) or CCK-(1-33) stimulated histamine release and acid secretion was unchanged by the CCK-A antagonist, while the <el> gastrin <le> antagonist induced a parallel and concentration-dependent decrease in stimulated <re> histamine and acid secretion <er>. 
To study interleukin-7 (IL-7) in early thymocyte development, we generated mice transgenic (<el> Tg <le>) for the IL-7 gene under control of the lck proximal promoter. Founder line <el> Tg <le>A, with the lowest level of IL-7 overexpression, showed enhanced alphabeta T-cell development. In contrast, in the highest overexpressing founder line, <el> Tg <le>B, alphabeta T-cell development was disturbed with a block at the earliest intrathymic precursor stage. This was due to decreased progenitor <re> proliferation <er> as assessed by Ki-67 staining and in vivo bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. Bcl-2 was up-regulated in T-cell-committed progenitors in all <el> Tg <le> lines, and accounted for greater numbers of double positive (DP), CD4 single positive (SP), and CD8SP thymocytes in <el> Tg <le>A mice where, in contrast to <el> Tg <le>B mice, thymocyte progenitor <re> proliferation <er> was normal. Mixed marrow chimeras using <el> Tg <le>B(+) and congenic mice as donors, and experiments using anti-IL-7 monoclonal antibody (MAb) in vivo, confirmed the role of IL-7 protein in the observed <el> Tg <le>B phenotype. 
In 50-90% of cases, humoral <re> hypercalcemia <er> of malignancy (HHM) is due to tumor secretion of parathyroid hormone-related protein (<el> PTHrP <le>). Glucocorticoids are sometimes used as calcium lowering agents and there are in vitro results showing that glucocorticoids diminish <el> PTHrP <le> production. In this study we tested whether the serum-calcium-lowering effect of glucocorticoids is due to decreased <el> PTHrP <le> production by the tumor. As an animal and cell culture model we used the Walker carcinosarcoma (WCS) 256, a rat mammary carcinoma cell line producing <el> PTHrP <le>. In vitro, dexamethasone caused a dose-dependent inhibition of <el> PTHrP <le> production, whereby already 1-5 nmol/L revealed a significant decrease by WCS 256 cells. In contrast to these in vitro results, in WCS 256 tumor-bearing rats, dexamethasone (4 mg/kg body weight on day 4, and 1 mg/kg body weight from day 5 until day 7 after WCS transplantation; circulating dexamethasone levels > 20 nmol/L) did not decrease <el> PTHrP <le> production, <el> PTHrP <le> secretion, serum calcium, or tumor weight in vivo. 
No data are present in the literature about the effect of cytokines on the prototype β chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) or of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα (PPARA)) activation on CCL2 and <re> CXCL10 <er> chemokines secretion in fibroblasts or preadipocytes in Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO). We have tested the effect of interferon γ (IFNγ (IFNG)) and tumor necrosis factor α (<el> TNF <le>α) on CCL2, and for comparison on the prototype α chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (<re> CXCL10 <er>), and the possible modulatory role of PPARα activation on secretion of these chemokines in normal and GO fibroblasts or preadipocytes in primary cell cultures. This study shows that IFNγ alone, or in combination with <el> TNF <le>α, stimulates the secretion of CCL2 in primary orbital fibroblasts or preadipocytes from patients with GO at levels similar to those observed in controls. IFNγ and <el> TNF <le>α also stimulated <re> CXCL10 <er> chemokine secretion as expected. The presence of PPARα and PPARγ (PPARG) in primary fibroblasts or preadipocytes of patients with GO has been confirmed. PPARα activators were able to inhibit the secretion of <re> CXCL10 <er> and CCL2, while PPARγ activators were confirmed to be able to inhibit <re> CXCL10 <er> but had no effect on CCL2. PPARα activators were stronger inhibitors of chemokine secretions than PPARγ agonists. 
c-Myc-overexpressing mammary epithelial cells are proapoptotic; their survival is strongly promoted by epidermal growth factor (EGF). We now demonstrate that EGF-induced <re> Akt <er> activation and survival in transgenic mouse mammary tumor virus-c-Myc mouse mammary carcinoma cells are both calcium/calmodulin-dependent. <re> Akt <er> activation is abolished by the phospholipase C-gamma inhibitor U-73122, by the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM, and by the specific calmodulin antagonist W-7. These results implicate calcium/calmodulin in the activation of <re> Akt <er> in these cells. In addition, <re> Akt <er> activation by serum and insulin is also inhibited by W-7. EGF-induced and calcium/calmodulin-mediated <re> Akt <er> activation occurs in both tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic mouse and human mammary epithelial cells, independent of their overexpression of c-Myc. These results imply that calcium/calmodulin may be a common regulator of <re> Akt <er> activation, irrespective of upstream receptor activator, mammalian species, and transformation status in mammary epithelial cells. However, only c-Myc-overexpressing mouse mammary carcinoma cells (but not normal mouse mammary epithelial cells) undergo apoptosis in the presence of the calmodulin antagonist W-7, indicating the vital selective role of calmodulin for survival of these cells. Calcium/calmodulin-regulated <re> Akt <er> activation is mediated directly by neither calmodulin kinases nor phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (<el> PI-3 <le> kinase). Pharmacological inhibitors of calmodulin kinase kinase and calmodulin kinases II and III do not inhibit EGF-induced <re> Akt <er> activation, and calmodulin antagonist W-7 does not inhibit phosphotyrosine-associated <el> PI-3 <le> kinase activation. <re> Akt <er> is, however, co-immunoprecipitated with calmodulin in an EGF-dependent manner, which is inhibited by calmodulin antagonist W-7. 
Oxalic acid is a virulence factor of several phytopathogenic fungi, including Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary, but the detailed mechanisms by which oxalic acid affects host cells and tissues are not understood. We tested the hypothesis that oxalate induces foliar wilting during fungal infection by manipulating guard cells. Unlike uninfected leaves, stomatal pores of Vicia faba leaves infected with S. sclerotiorum are open at night. This cellular response appears to be dependent on oxalic acid because stomatal pores are partially closed when leaves are infected with an oxalate-deficient mutant of S. sclerotiorum. In contrast to oxalate-deficient S. sclerotiorum, wild-type fungus causes an increase in stomatal conductance and transpiration as well as a decrease in plant biomass. Green fluorescent protein-tagged S. sclerotiorum emerges through open stomata from the uninfected abaxial leaf surface for secondary colonization. Exogenous application of oxalic acid to the detached abaxial epidermis of V. faba leaves induces stomatal opening. Guard cells treated with oxalic acid accumulate potassium and break down starch, both of which are known to contribute to stomatal opening. Oxalate interferes with abscisic acid (<el> ABA <le>)-induced <re> stomatal closure <er>. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) L. Heynh. mutants abi1, abi3, abi4, and aba2 are more susceptible to oxalate-deficient S. sclerotiorum than wild-type plants, suggesting that Sclerotinia resistance is dependent on <el> ABA <le>. 
The melanocortin system coordinates the maintenance of energy balance via the regulation of both food intake and energy expenditure. Leptin, a key adipogenic hormone involved in the regulation of energy balance is thought to act by stimulating production, in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (<el> alphaMSH <le>), a potent agonist of MC3/4 melanocortin receptors located in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Additionally leptin inhibits release of agouti-related protein (AgRP), an MC4R antagonist. During periods of caloric restriction, weight loss is not sustained because compensatory mechanisms, such as reduced resting metabolic rate (<re> RMR <er>) are brought into play. Understanding how these compensatory systems operate may provide valuable targets for pharmaceutical therapies to support traditional dieting approaches. As circulating leptin is reduced during caloric restriction, it may mediate some of the observed compensatory responses. In addition to decreases in circulating leptin levels, circulating AgRP is increased during fasting in rodents while <el> alphaMSH <le> is decreased. As central administration of AgRP depresses metabolism, we hypothesised that the peripheral rise in AgRP might be involved in signalling the depression of <re> RMR <er> during food restriction. We hypothesised that changes in plasma AgRP and <el> alphaMSH <le> may coordinate the regulation of changes in energy expenditure acting through central MC4 melanocortin receptors via the sympathetic nervous system.We show here that acute peripherally administered AgRP at supra-physiological concentrations in both lean (C57BL/6) and obese leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice does not depress <re> RMR <er>, possibly because it crosses the blood-brain barrier very slowly compared with other metabolites. However, in vitro AgRP can decrease leptin secretion, by approximately 40%, from adipocytes into culture medium and may via this axis have an effect on energy metabolism during prolonged caloric restriction. In contrast, peripheral [Nle4,D-Phe7]-alpha MSH produced a large and sustained increase in resting energy expenditure (0.15 ml O2/min; P < 0.05) with a similar response in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice (0.27 ml O2/min) indicating that this effect is independent of the status of leptin production in the periphery. In both cases respiratory exchange ratio and the levels of energy expended on spontaneous physical activity were unaffected by the administration of peripheral [Nle4,D-Phe7]-alpha MSH. 
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of isocaloric intake from a high-fat diet (<el> HFD <le>) on <re> insulin resistance <er> and inflammation in rats. Male Wistar rats were fed on an <el> HFD <le> (n = 12) or control diet (n = 12) for 12 weeks. Subsequently, all animals were euthanized, and blood glucose, insulin, free fatty acids, C-reactive protein, lipid profile, cytokines and hepatic-enzyme activity were determined. Carcass chemical composition was also analyzed. During the first and the twelfth weeks of the experimental protocol, the oral glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test were performed and demonstrated <re> insulin resistance <er> (P < 0.05) in the <el> HFD <le> group. Although food intake (g) was lower (P < 0.05) in the <el> HFD <le> group compared with the control group, the concentration of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, C-reactive protein and liver weight were all significantly higher. The kinase inhibitor of κB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase and protein kinase B expressions were determined in the liver and skeletal muscle. After an insulin stimulus, the <el> HFD <le> group demonstrated decreased (P = 0.05) hepatic protein kinase B expression, whereas the kinase inhibitor of κB phospho/total ratio was elevated in the <el> HFD <le> muscle (P = 0.02). 
We have shown previously that human apolipoprotein (apo)C1 transgenic mice exhibit hyperlipidaemia, due primarily to an impaired clearance of very-low-density <re> lipoprotein <er> (VLDL) particles from the circulation. In the absence of at least the low-density-<re> lipoprotein <er> receptor (LDLR), it was shown that APOC1 overexpression in transgenic mice inhibited the hepatic uptake of VLDL via the LDLR-related protein. In the present study, we have now examined the effect of apoC1 on the binding of <re> lipoprotein <er>s to both the VLDL receptor (VLDLR) and the LDLR. The binding specificity of the VLDLR and LDLR for apoC1-enriched <re> lipoprotein <er> particles was examined in vivo through adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of the VLDLR and the LDLR [giving rise to adenovirus-containing (Ad)-VLDLR and Ad-LDLR respectively] in APOC1 transgenic mice, LDLR-deficient (LDLR-/-) mice and wild-type mice. Remarkably, Ad-VLDLR treatment did not reduce hyperlipidaemia in transgenic mice overexpressing human APOC1, irrespective of both the level of transgenic expression and the presence of the LDLR, whereas Ad-VLDLR treatment did reverse hyperlipidaemia in LDLR-/- and wild-type mice. On the other hand, Ad-LDLR treatment strongly decreased plasma lipid levels in these APOC1 transgenic mice. These results suggest that apoC1 inhibits the clearance of <re> lipoprotein <er> particles via the VLDLR, but not via the LDLR. This hypothesis is corroborated by in vitro binding studies. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing the VLDLR (CHO-VLDLR) or LDLR (CHO-LDLR) bound less APOC1 transgenic VLDL than wild-type VLDL. Intriguingly, however, enrichment with <el> apoE <le> enhanced dose-dependently the binding of wild-type VLDL to CHO-VLDLR cells (up to 5-fold), whereas <el> apoE <le> did not enhance the binding of APOC1 transgenic VLDL to these cells. In contrast, for binding to CHO-LDLR cells, both wild-type and APOC1 transgenic VLDL were stimulated upon enrichment with <el> apoE <le>. 
Dysfunction of the ubiquitin-<el> proteasome <le> system (UPS) and calcium homeostasis has been implicated in the neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The cytosolic calcium concentration is maintained by store-operated calcium entry (<re> SOCE <er>), which is repressed by Alzheimer's disease-associated mutants, such as mutant presenilins. We hypothesized that inhibition of UPS impacts <re> SOCE <er>. This study showed that pretreatment with sub-lethal levels of <el> proteasome <le> inhibitors, including MG-132 and clasto-lactacystin-β-lactone (LA), reduced <re> SOCE <er> after depletion of endoplasmic reticulum calcium in rat neurons. With the same treatment, MG-132 and LA reduced the protein levels of stromal interaction molecule 1and 2 (STIM1/2), but not the levels of Orai1 and canonical transient receptor potential channel 1 (TRPC1). STIM1 or STIM2 protein was mobilized to lysosome by MG-132/LA treatment as observed under an immunofluorescence confocal laser microscope. In the neurons, MG-132 and LA degraded p62/SQSTM1, promoted autophagy, converted LC3I to LC3II, and promoted co-localization of LC3 and lysosomes. Rapamycin, which enhances autophagy, reduced STIM1/2 protein levels, whereas bafilomycin, which inhibits autophagy, increased their protein levels. The protein levels of STIM1/2 and the amplitude of <re> SOCE <er> were decreased in SH-SY5Y with decreased protein level of <el> proteasome <le> subunit beta type-5 induced by shRNA. 
The modulatory role of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) on pulmonary <re> edema <er> induced by acetylcholine (ACh), <el> capsaicin <le>, substance P (SP) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was investigated by using an inhibitor of NO synthase, N-omega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA). The effects of endogenous NO on the hemodynamic response to ACh, 5-HT and SP were also investigated. The capillary filtration coefficient (Kf,c), the total pressure gradient (delta Pt) and its four components [arterial (delta Pa), pre- (delta Pa') and post-capillary (delta Pv'), and venous gradient (delta Pv)] were evaluated on isolated, ventilated, perfused rabbit lungs. ACh (10(-8) to 10(-4) M) and SP (10(-10) to 10(-6) M) induced a concentration-dependent increase in the Kf,c. Capsaicin (10(-4) M) and 5-HT (10(-4) M) also increased this parameter. L-NNA (10(-4) M) completely inhibited the effects of ACh and <el> capsaicin <le> on the Kf,c, without preventing the effects of SP and 5-HT. ACh induced a concentration-dependent vasoconstriction in the precapillary segment. Pretreatment with L-NNA enhanced this increase in delta Pa' but also increased delta Pv' and delta Pv. 5-HT increased delta Pt and delta Pa proportionally to the concentration. This effect was enhanced by L-NNA, which also increased delta Pa'. SP had no significant hemodynamic effect. Pretreatment with L-NNA did not modify the response to SP. Sodium nitroprusside (10(-5) M) induced a left shift of the concentration-response curve to ACh on the Kf,c, although it did not change the response to SP. Sodium nitroprusside also inhibited the hemodynamic effect of ACh. 
The natural compound amygdalin has gained high popularity among tumor patients as a complementary or alternative treatment option. However, due to metabolization of amygdalin to <el> cyanide <le> (HCN) following oral consumption, there could be a high risk of lactic <re> acidosis <er> caused by <el> cyanide <le> intoxication. The present retrospective study was undertaken to evaluate <el> cyanide <le> blood and lactate plasma levels of tumor patients (n = 55) before and after intravenous (i.v.) amygdalin infusion. All patients had also continuously ingested amygdalin tablets (3 x 500 mg/day), excepting on the days of i.v. administration. Each patient received one to five intravenous amygdalin treatments. The time period between each i.v. application ranged between 4-6 days. The initial i.v. dose was 6 mg (n = 28), 9 mg (n = 1), 15 mg (n = 1) or 18 mg (n = 25). The mean <el> cyanide <le> blood level before i.v. amygdalin administration was 34.74 μg/L, which increased significantly to a mean value of 66.20 μg/L after i. v. amygdalin application. In contrast, lactate decreased significantly from 1266 μmol/L pre-infusion to 868 μmol/L post-infusion. Increasing i.v. amygdalin by 1 mg was also associated with a significant increase in the <el> cyanide <le> level, while the lactate blood level significantly decreased. This is the first study evaluating <el> cyanide <le> levels under conditions employed by amygdalin administrators, i.e. after chronic oral amygdalin intake and then again after a closely subsequent intravenous amygdalin administration. 
Hyperactive or primed neutrophils which damage tissue via cytokines and membrane receptors may be implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory conditions. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the priming mechanism in neutrophils by assessing changes in membrane receptors and the <el> Fc gamma R <le>-mediated <re> respiratory burst <er>, measured as chemiluminescence. Purified neutrophilic granulocytes from healthy volunteers were preincubated with recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha. This had a priming effect, increasing both the Fc gamma receptor-mediated luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence and the membrane expression of the C3bi receptor (CRB) (r = 0.843). The membrane densities of <el> Fc gamma R <le>II, <el> Fc gamma R <le>III, and CR1 were unaffected by tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The mechanism of increased chemiluminescence may involve redistribution of the Fc gamma receptors and cooperation with upregulated CR3, facilitating crosslinking of the receptors. The experiments were performed in a buffer without divalent cations, since these increased the background activity and abolished the priming effect of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. 
Agonists acting at alpha2-adrenergic receptors (alpha2ARs) produce antinociception and synergize with opioids. The alpha2ARs are divided into three subtypes, alpha(2A)<re> AR <er>, alpha(2B)<re> AR <er>, and alpha(2C)<re> AR <er>. Most alpha2AR agonists require alpha(2A)<re> AR <er> activation to produce antinociception and opioid synergy. The same subtype also mediates the side effect of sedation, which limits the clinical utility of these compounds. Identification of a non-alpha(2A)<re> AR <er>-mediated antinociceptive agent would enhance the therapeutic utility of alpha2AR agonists in pain management. Previous studies have suggested that the alpha2AR agonist <el> ST91 <le> [2-(2,6-diethylphenylamino)-2-imidazoline hydrochloride] has a nonsedating, non-alpha(2A)<re> AR <er> mechanism of action. We examined the pharmacology of spinal <el> ST91 <le> and its interaction with the delta-opioid agonist deltorphin II (Tyr-D-Ala-Phe-Glu-Val-Val-Gly amide) in mice lacking either functional alpha(2A)<re> AR <er>s or alpha(2C)<re> AR <er>s. All drugs were administered by direct lumbar puncture, and drug interactions were evaluated using isobolographic analysis. In contrast to the majority of alpha2AR agonists, <el> ST91 <le> potency was only moderately reduced (3-fold) in the absence of the alpha(2A)<re> AR <er>. Studies with the alpha2AR subtype-preferring antagonists BRL-44408 (2-[2H-(1-methyl-1,3-dihydroisoindole)methyl]-4,5-dihydroimidazole maleate) and prazosin [[4-(4-amino-6,7-dimethoxy-quinazolin-2-yl) piperazin-1-yl]-(2-furyl)methanone] and the pan-alpha2AR antagonist SKF-86466 (6-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3-methyl-1-H-3-benzazepine) suggest a shift from alpha(2A)<re> AR <er> to the other alpha2AR subtype(s) in the absence of alpha(2A)<re> AR <er>. Antinociceptive synergy with deltorphin II was preserved in the absence of either alpha(2A)<re> AR <er> or alpha(2C)<re> AR <er>. 
The inhibition of transcription by RNA polymerase III in poliovirus-infected cells was studied. Experiments utilizing two different cell lines showed that the initiation step of transcription by RNA polymerase III was impaired by <el> infection <le> of these cells with the virus. The observed inhibition of transcription was not due to shut-off of host cell protein synthesis by poliovirus. Among four distinct components required for accurate transcription in vitro from cloned DNA templates, activities of RNA polymerase III and transcription factor TFIIIA were not significantly affected by virus <el> infection <le>. The activity of transcription factor <re> TFIIIC <er>, the limiting component required for transcription of RNA polymerase III genes, was severely inhibited in infected cells, whereas that of transcription factor TFIIIB was inhibited to a lesser extent. The sequence-specific DNA-binding of <re> TFIIIC <er> to the adenovirus VA1 gene internal promoter, however, was not altered by <el> infection <le> of cells with the virus. 
Hypoxia is well known to decrease appetite and weight gain in growing rats, and to induce <re> weight loss <er> in humans. It has been hypothesized that this is mediated by a change in <el> ghrelin <le>, an orexigenic peptide synthesized and released primarily from the stomach. Rats were exposed to hypoxia for 7 d as neonates (birth-7 d of age), weanlings (28-35 d of age), and juveniles (49-56 d of age). Hypoxia had no effect on total or active plasma <el> ghrelin <le>. There was a significant decrease in active <el> ghrelin <le> in weaned rats (0.8 +/- 0.1 ng/mL) compared to nursing pups at 7 d of age (2.3 +/- 0.2 ng/mL). The proportion of total <el> ghrelin <le> that was active decreased significantly between 7 and 35 d of age. 
Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (<re> TSLP <er>), an immunomodulating potentially disease-inducing cytokine, is overproduced in <el> TLR3 <le>-stimulated bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatic donors whereas production of antiviral IFNβ is deficient. It is of therapeutic interest that capsazepine inhibits epithelial <re> TSLP <er> and relaxes human small airways with similar potencies. However, it is not known if other capsazepine-like compounds share such dual actions. This study explores epithelial anti-<re> TSLP <er> and anti-IFNβ effects of capsazepine and novel capsazepine-like bronchorelaxants. We used primary bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatic and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) donors, and human small airways dissected from surgically removed lungs. Seven novel capsazepinoids were about 10 times, and one compound (RES187) >30 times, more potent than capsazepine as relaxants of LTD(4)-contracted small airways. <el> TLR3 <le>-induced <re> TSLP <er>, TNFα, CXCL8, and IFNβ mRNA and protein levels were dose-dependently and non-selectively inhibited by capsazepine, equally in cells from asthmatic and COPD donors. The novel compounds, except RES187, reduced <re> TSLP <er> and IFNβ but none are more potent than capsazepine. Only capsazepine consistently inhibited TNFα and CXCL8 production and attenuated <el> TLR3 <le>-induced epithelial NF-κB signalling. Hence, the present compounds did not separate between inhibition of <el> TLR3 <le>-induced epithelial <re> TSLP <er> and IFNβ, but all compounds, except capsazepine, did separate between the bronchorelaxant and the epithelial immune effects. 
Glucose ingestion during exercise attenuates the release of the myokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) from working skeletal muscle, which results in a diminished increase in plasma IL-6. Interleukin-6 receptor alpha (<re> IL-6Ralpha <er>) expression in skeletal muscle is induced by acute exercise, mediated in part by an increased IL-6 concentration in the bloodstream. We hypothesized that endurance training would increase the density of <re> IL-6Ralpha <er> in skeletal muscle and that <el> glucose <le> ingestion would attenuate the effect. Nine subjects performed 10 weeks of one-legged knee-extensor training. They trained one leg (Glc-leg) while ingesting a <el> glucose <le> solution (Glc) and ingested a placebo (Plc) while training the other leg (Plc-leg). Endurance training increased peak power by 14% and reduced the exercise-induced gene expression of IL-6 and <re> IL-6Ralpha <er> in skeletal muscle and IL-6 plasma concentration. The <re> IL-6Ralpha <er> density increased to a lesser extent in the Glc-leg, suggesting that <el> glucose <le> ingestion attenuates the effect of training on <re> IL-6Ralpha <er> by blunting the IL-6 response. 
Pregnancy in rodents is associated with important maternal metabolic changes. Early pregnancy is considered to be an anabolic phase of nutrient storing, while in late pregnancy, a catabolic phase develops to help meet the metabolic demands of the rapidly growing conceptus. Similarly, major changes also occur in the IGFs, IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) and GH axis. In the rat, maternal serum IGF-I levels increase from early to mid-pregnancy, after which IGF-I levels decline. Conversely, as IGF-I levels decline, pituitary-derived rat GH increases twofold. This coincides with a decrease in <re> IGFBP-3 <er> and the appearance of an <el> IGFBP protease <le>. However, the physiological role of these changes is unclear. The aim of our study was to examine the roles of GH, IGFs and IGFBPs during pregnancy in a unique isolated GH-deficient rat model, spontaneous dwarf rats. Pregnancy in GH-deficient dams resulted in a significantly reduced litter number, and maternal weight gain (day 21-day 1) was reduced by 28% when compared with dams with normal GH levels (GH-normal dams). In the sera of GH-normal dams, IGF-I levels increased 2.6-fold by day 4 of pregnancy and then progressively declined to below non-pregnant levels. Serum IGF-II levels were low and remained unchanged. Western-ligand blot analysis showed that <re> IGFBP-3 <er> was present in non-pregnancy and early pregnancy sera, but declined dramatically after day 12. This decline in <re> IGFBP-3 <er> coincided with the detection of an <el> IGFBP protease <le>. In contrast, in non-pregnancy sera from GH-deficient rats, serum IGF-I concentrations were 10% of the levels seen in GH-normal females, and neither IGF-I nor IGF-II concentrations changed with pregnancy. Furthermore, in GH-deficient dams, serum <re> IGFBP-3 <er> (as assessed by Western-ligand blot analysis) was low in non-pregnancy and early pregnancy sera, and became undetectable by day 12 of pregnancy. The low concentrations of <re> IGFBP-3 <er> in early pregnancy serum from GH-deficient rats coincided with IGFBP-proteolytic activity, and the decline in serum <re> IGFBP-3 <er> after day 16 was the result of increased protease activity. 
Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I), known as Hurler syndrome in the severe form, is a lysosomal storage disease due to alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) deficiency. It results in fragmentation of <re> elastin <er> fibers in the aorta and heart valves via mechanisms that are unclear, but may result from the accumulation of the glycosaminoglycans heparan and dermatan sulfate. Elastin fragmentation causes aortic dilatation and valvular insufficiency, which can result in cardiovascular disease. The pathophysiology of aortic disease was evaluated in MPS I mice. MPS I mice have normal elastic fiber structure and aortic compliance at early ages, which suggests that <re> elastin <er> assembly is normal. Elastin fragmentation and aortic dilatation are severe at 6 months, which is temporally associated with marked increases in mRNA and enzyme activity for two <re> elastin <er>-degrading proteins, matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP-12) and <el> cathepsin S. <le> Upregulation of these genes likely involves activation of STAT proteins, which may be induced by structural stress to smooth muscle cells from accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in lysosomes. Neonatal intravenous injection of a retroviral vector normalized MMP-12 and cathepsin S mRNA levels and prevented aortic disease. 
The aim of this study was to examine if the growth factor, transforming growth factor beta 1 (<el> TGF beta <le> 1), could prevent induction of <re> nitric oxide <er> synthase and cytokine-mediated inhibitory effects in the insulin-containing, clonal beta cell line RINm5F. Treatment of RINm5F cells for 24 h with interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) (100 pM) induced expression of <re> nitric oxide <er> synthase and inhibited glyceraldehyde-stimulated insulin secretion. Combinations of IL-1 beta (100 pM), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (100 pM) and interferon-gamma (100 pM) reduced RINm5F cell viability (determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) reduction assay) and de novo protein synthesis, as measured by incorporation of radiolabelled amino acids into perchloric acid-precipitable protein. Pretreatment of RINm5F cells with <el> TGF beta <le> 1 (10 pM) for 18 or 24 h, prior to the addition of either IL-1 beta or combined cytokines, prevented cytokine-induced inhibition of insulin secretion, protein synthesis and the loss of cell viability. <el> TGF beta <le> 1 pretreatment inhibited cytokine-induced expression and activity of <re> nitric oxide <er> synthase in RINm5F cells as determined by Western blotting and by cytosolic conversion of radiolabelled arginine into labelled citrulline and <re> nitric oxide <er>. Chemically generated superoxide also induced expression of <re> nitric oxide <er> synthase possibly due to direct activation of the nuclear transcription factor NF kappa B, an effect prevented by both an antioxidant and <el> TGF beta <le> 1 pretreatment. 
In a mouse model of herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 corneal infection, tissue destruction results from a CD4+ T cell-mediated chronic inflammation, in which interleukin 2 and interferon (IFN) gamma are requisite inflammatory mediators and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (<re> PMN <er>) are the predominant infiltrating cells. In vivo neutralization of <el> IFN-gamma <le> relieved inflammation at least in part through a specific block of <re> PMN <er> extravasation into HSV-1-infected corneas. Intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) 1 and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) 1 were upregulated on the vascular endothelium of inflamed corneas. Reduced <re> PMN <er> extravasation in anti-<el> IFN-gamma <le>-treated mice was associated with a dramatic reduction of PECAM-1 but not ICAM-1 expression on vascular endothelium. <re> PMN <er> accumulated in the lumen of corneal vessels after in vivo <el> IFN-gamma <le> neutralization. PECAM-1 was readily detectable on <re> PMN <er> inside the vessels but was not detectable on <re> PMN <er> that extravasated into the infected cornea. Moreover, flow cytometric analysis revealed reduced PECAM-1 expression but elevated major histocompatibility complex class I expression on <re> PMN <er> that recently extravasated into the peritoneal cavity when compared with <re> PMN <er> in the peripheral blood. 
The role of intracellular calcium stores in stimulus-secretion coupling in the pancreatic beta-cell is largely unknown. We report here that <el> tetracaine <le> stimulates <re> insulin secretion <er> from collagenase-isolated mouse islets of Langerhans in the absence of glucose or extracellular calcium. We also found that the anesthetic evokes a dose-dependent rise of the intracellular free-calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in cultured rat and mouse beta-cells. The <el> tetracaine <le>-specific [Ca2+]i rise also occurs in the absence of glucose, or in beta-cells depolarized by exposure to a Ca(2+)-deficient medium (< 1 microM) or elevated [K+]o. Furthermore, <el> tetracaine <le> (> or = 300 microM) depolarized the beta-cell membrane in mouse pancreatic islets, but inhibited Ca2+ entry through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in HIT cells, an insulin-secreting cell line. From these data we conclude that <el> tetracaine <le>-enhancement of insulin release occurs by mechanisms that are independent of Ca2+ entry across the cell membrane. The <el> tetracaine <le>-induced [Ca2+]i rise in cultured rat beta-cells and <re> insulin secretion <er> from mouse islets is insensitive to dantrolene (20 microM), a drug that inhibits Ca2+ release evoked by cholinergic agonists in the pancreatic beta-cell, and thapsigargin (3 microM), a blocker of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ pump. 
Nitric oxide has been implicated as one possible mediator of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1)-induced inhibition of <re> insulin secretion <er> and islet cell damage. The aim of this study was to define the effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and interferon-gamma (IFN) on nitric oxide production, <re> insulin secretion <er>, and DNA damage in islets from unweaned rats. Treatment of islets with 0.5-500 U/ml of either TNF or IFN on their own inhibited <el> glucose <le>-stimulated <re> insulin secretion <er> in a dose-dependent manner (minimum effective dose 5 U/ml). In combination, the cytokines exerted a pronounced synergistic inhibitory effect on secretion and were equipotent at causing a significant and concentration-dependent increase in culture medium nitrite levels, islet cyclic GMP formation, and DNA damage. Used alone or in combination, TNF and IFN significantly enhanced the activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase as determined by measuring the conversion of 14C-labeled arginine to 14C-labeled citrulline and nitric oxide. Use of arginine-free medium, without or with NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, resulted in inhibition of nitrite formation by 5-1,000 U/ml IFN+TNF and partial restoration of the insulin secretory response to <el> glucose <le>. Treatment of rat islets with increasing doses of TNF+IFN (5, 50, and 500 U/ml) resulted in a progressive increase in DNA damage, as shown by the comet assay, which detects DNA strand breaks in individual islet cells. The DNA damage caused by an intermediate concentration (50 U/ml) of TNF+IFN was comparable to that generated by IL-1 when used at 20 U/ml. 
Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) and porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) are characterized by skin morbidity, induced by pro-inflammatory reactive oxygen species generated by the photosensitizing properties of protoporphyrin IX and uroporphyrin I. How these <el> porphyrins <le> exert a toxic effect on the liver in the absence of light is poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that <el> porphyrins <le> can interference with cellular redox systems, by studying the dark effects of protoporphyrin (PP), haematoporphyrin (HP), deuteroporphyrin (DP) and uroporphyrin (UP) on the cellular redox system of phagocytes, and on enzymatic oxyradical generating systems. Both in phagocytic cells and enzymatic systems, a dose-dependent inhibition of chemiluminescence was observed by all <el> porphyrins <le> added. Catalase and SOD-like activity of <el> porphyrins <le> was excluded by oxygraph and ferricytochrome c reduction. However, ferrocytochrome c oxidation was inhibited by <el> porphyrins <le> indicating ferrireductase-like activity. In a Fenton <re> type <er> reaction between H2O2 and PP, we could demonstrate the generation of .OH, or an electronically excited porphyrin species. No influence on phagocyte chemotaxis, phagocytosis and killing-capacity was observed. 
The present patch-clamp study describes the effect of <el> hypoxia <le> at 30-31 degrees C on membrane potential and resting conductance in pyramidal cells from the hippocampal <re> CA1 <er> region in rat brain slices. The initial effect of <el> hypoxia <le> was a gradual hyperpolarization; the peak change in membrane potential measured over 15 min was -5.3 +/- 0.22 mV (P < 0.0001). After reoxygenation followed a transient hyperpolarization measuring -1.8 +/- 0.24 mV (P < 0.0001) and a subsequent normalization of the membrane potential, which after 5 min did not differ from its level prior to the hypoxic episode. Voltage-clamp analysis showed that the hypoxic hyperpolarization was related to an outward current at the holding potential (-60 mV) and an increase in resting conductance. The effect was not influenced by intracellular Cl- concentration, which indicated that it was not due to an inward flow of Cl- ions. The addition of tolbutamide, glibenclamide and dantrolene sodium did not affect the hypoxic hyperpolarization, neither did the presence of ATP in the pipette solution. The presence/absence of glucose in the perfusion medium did not influence the initial hyperpolarization during <el> hypoxia <le>; however, glucose seemed to prevent the subsequent depolarization under <el> hypoxia <le>. 
A novel peptide VIP-TAT with a cell penetrating peptide TAT at the C-terminus of VIP was constructed and prepared using intein mediated purification with an affinity chitin-binding tag (IMPACT) system to enhance the brain uptake efficiency for the medical application in central nervous system. It was found by labeling VIP-TAT and VIP with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) that the extension with TAT increased the brain uptake efficiency of VIP-TAT significantly. Then short-term and long-term treatment with scopolamine (<el> Scop <le>) was used to evaluate the effect of VIP-TAT or VIP on <el> Scop <le> induced <re> amnesia <er>. Both short-term and long-term administration of VIP-TAT inhibited the latent time reduction in step-through test induced by <el> Scop <le> significantly, but long-term administration of VIP aggravated the <el> Scop <le> induced <re> amnesia <er>. Long-term i.p. injection of VIP-TAT was shown to have positive effect by inhibiting the oxidative damage, apoptosis and the cholinergic system activity reduction that induced by <el> Scop <le>, while VIP exerted negative effect in brain opposite to that in periphery system. The in vitro data showed that VIP-TAT had not only protective but also proliferative effect on Neuro2a cells which was inhibited by PAC1 antagonist PACAP(6-38). Competition binding assay and cAMP assay confirmed that VIP-TAT had higher affinity and activation for PAC1 than VIP. 
Although long-term administration of <el> salsalate <le> depresses blood levels of both total thyroxine (<re> T4 <er>) and total triiodothyronine (T3) and at least transiently decreases serum thyrotropin (TSH), changes in thyroid function tests have not been fully characterized during its short-term use. It is also unclear if the observed changes are solely the result of decreased hormone binding to carrier proteins or if reduced hepatic 5'-monodeiodinase activity is important. Blood was sampled at baseline (day 0) and after 24 hours (day 1) and 72 hours (day 3) in eight subjects taking a therapeutic dose of <el> salsalate <le> 1,500 mg twice daily. Total <re> T4 <er> decreased from 90.1+/-7.7 nmol/L (mean+/-SD) on day 0 to 82.9+/-8.6 nmol/L on day 1 (P=.1 v baseline) and 68.6+/-8.7 nmol/L on day 3 (P=.0001). Total T3 decreased from 1.76+/-0.20 nmol/L to 1.61+/-0.16 nmol/L on day 1 (P<.05) and 1.31+/-0.27 nmol/L on day 3 (P=.002). The <re> T4 <er>/T3 ratio was 51.7+/-7.7 at baseline and remained unchanged after 3 days. Levels of reverse T3 (rT3) were reduced from 0.24+/-0.05 nmol/L to 0.18+/-0.02 nmol/L on day 3 (P<.05). While the free <re> T4 <er> index (FTI) declined in parallel with total <re> T4 <er>, the free <re> T4 <er> level by direct equilibrium dialysis (FTD) was unchanged after 3 days. Serum TSH decreased from 1.47+/-0.47 mU/L to 0.91+/-0.27 mU/L after 1 day (P<.05) and remained suppressed after 3 days (0.95+/-0.49 mU/L, P<.05). 
Arginine vasopressin (<el> VP <le>) activates phospholipase C (PLC) and stimulates <re> insulin secretion <er> and inositol phosphate (insP) production in mouse islets and clonal hamster beta cells (HIT). The insulin response to <el> VP <le> is reportedly dependent on extracellular glucose and there is evidence that glucose also activates PLC. The interactions of <el> VP <le> and glucose have been further examined in HIT cells. Glucose stimulated <re> insulin secretion <er> but not insP production and <el> VP <le> stimulated both <re> insulin secretion <er> and insP production in the absence of extracellular glucose. However, in the presence of glucose the insulin and insP responses to <el> VP <le> were potentiated. The phorbol ester, tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA), which activates protein kinase C (PKC), stimulated basal <re> insulin secretion <er> but inhibited insP production. In the presence of submaximal concentrations of <el> VP <le>, 100 nmol/l TPA inhibited <el> VP <le>-stimulated inositol monophosphate production and there was no additivity of stimulated <re> insulin secretion <er>. With a maximal (10 nmol/l) concentration of <el> VP <le>, TPA caused additive <re> insulin secretion <er> and insP levels were stimulated above baseline. Twenty-four hour preincubation with TPA to down-regulate PKC did not inhibit the insulin response to <el> VP <le>. 
The present study was performed to determine when follicle-stimulating hormone (<el> FSH <le>) begins to promote Sertoli cell division in fetal rats, and to determine whether the effect of <el> FSH <le> is mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (<re> PKA <er>). When testes from 15- to 17-day fetuses were cultured with or without <el> FSH <le> for 48 h, <el> FSH <le> did not promote Sertoli cell division in 15-day testes, but did in 16- and 17-day testes. Anti-rat <el> FSH <le> was injected into 16-day fetuses in utero. Twenty-four hours later, the testes of the injected fetuses and those of their intact littermates were cultured with or without <el> FSH <le> for 48 h. Without <el> FSH <le>, the Sertoli cell division index was significantly lower in anti-<el> FSH <le>-treated fetuses than in intact fetuses. With <el> FSH <le>, however, the index increased. When <re> PKA <er> inhibitor was added to cultures of 16-day testes with <el> FSH <le>, the promotion of Sertoli cell division by <el> FSH <le> was inhibited. 
This study was designed to gain insight into the role of microsomal <re> triglyceride <er> transfer protein (<el> MTP <le>) in the association of apolipoprotein (apo) B with lipid during intestinal lipoprotein assembly. The <el> MTP <le>-inhibiting compound BMS-200150 (Jamil et al. 1996. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93: 11991-11995) was used to inhibit the lipid transfer activity of <el> MTP <le> in Caco-2 cells. <el> MTP <le> inhibition reduced the number of apoB-containing lipoproteins that were secreted from the cells. Secretion of apoB-100 appeared to be more sensitive to BMS-200150 than apoB-48 secretion, which appeared to be relatively insensitive. BMS-200150 caused a decrease in the <re> triglyceride <er> content of the secreted lipoproteins, compared with control incubations without <el> MTP <le> inhibition. This indicated that, in Caco-2 cells, <el> MTP <le> is not only involved in the first step of lipoprotein synthesis, i.e., the rescue of apoB from intracellular degradation through early lipidation of the protein, but also in further steps involving the association of lipoproteins with <re> triglyceride <er>s. When 0.5 mM oleic acid (18:1) was used to stimulate cellular lipid synthesis, secreted lipoproteins were predominantly of chylomicron/VLDL density and their secretion could be efficiently inhibited with BMS-200150. With 0.5 mm palmitic acid (16:0), lipoproteins of distinct densities (i.e., chylomicron/VLDL and IDL/LDL) were secreted by Caco-2 cells, as reported before (van Greevenbroek et al. 1995. J. Lipid Res. 36: 13-24). Secretion of the lipoproteins at chylomicron/VLDL density was strongly reduced by inhibition of <el> MTP <le> activity by BMS-200150, whereas the IDL/LDL density lipoproteins were relatively insensitive. 
Immune deviation of cytolytic T cell function, induced by type 2 cytokines like <el> IL-4 <le>, is an attractive concept to explain failure of the immune system in some diseases. However, this concept is challenged by previous conflicting results on whether type 2 cytokine-producing <re> CD8 <er>(+) T cells are cytolytic. Therefore, we have analyzed the relationship between cytolytic activity and cytokine production among large numbers of primary <re> CD8 <er>(+) T cell clones. Single murine <re> CD8 <er>(+) T cells of naive phenotype were activated at high efficiency with immobilized Abs to CD3, <re> CD8 <er>, and CD11a in the presence of IL-2 (neutral conditions) or IL-2, <el> IL-4 <le>, and anti-IFN-gamma Ab (type 2-polarizing conditions) for 8-9 days. Under neutral conditions, most clones produced IFN-gamma without <el> IL-4 <le> and were cytolytic. Under type 2-polarizing conditions, most clones produced IFN-gamma and <el> IL-4 <le> but displayed variable cytolytic activity and <re> CD8 <er> expression. Separation on the basis of surface <re> CD8 <er> levels revealed that, compared with <re> CD8 <er>(high) cells from the same cultures, <re> CD8 <er>(low) cells were poorly cytolytic and expressed low levels of perforin mRNA and protein and granzyme A, B, and C mRNA. A similar, smaller population of noncytolytic <re> CD8 <er>(low) cells was identified among <re> CD8 <er>(+) T cells activated in mixed lymphocyte reaction with <el> IL-4 <le>. Variable efficiency of generation of the noncytolytic cells may account for the differing results of earlier studies. 
We previously reported that tumour necrosis factor alpha (<el> TNFalpha <le>) can mimic classic ischemic preconditioning (IPC) in both cells and heart. However, the signalling pathways involved remain incompletely understood. One potential protective pathway could be <el> TNFalpha <le>-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). We hypothesized that <el> TNFalpha <le> cytoprotection occurs through the generation of ROS which originate within the mitochondria. C(2)C(12) myotubes were preconditioned with either a short period of hypoxia (IPC) or a low concentration of <el> TNFalpha <le> (0.5 ng/ml) prior to a simulated ischemic insult. <re> ROS generation <er> was evaluated on cells stained with dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) by flow cytometry. The source of <el> TNFalpha <le>-induced ROS was examined with Mitotracker Red CM-H(2)XRos. The bioenergetics of the mitochondria were evaluated by investigation of the respiratory parameters and the inner mitochondrial membrane potential. Pretreatment with <el> TNFalpha <le> improved cell viability compared with the simulated ischemic control (<el> TNFalpha <le>: 75 +/- 1% versus 34 +/- 1% for the control: p<0.001). The ROS scavenger, N-2-mercaptopropionyl-glycine (MPG), reduced the viability of <el> TNFalpha <le>-stimulated cells to 15 +/- 1% (p<0.001 versus <el> TNFalpha <le>). Similar results were obtained with IPC. <el> TNFalpha <le> stimulation increased ROS production mainly in the mitochondria, and this increase was abolished in the presence of MPG. Addition of <el> TNFalpha <le> to the cells increased State 2 respiration and modestly depolarised the membrane potential prior to the ischemic insult. 
Artificial nighttime illumination has recently become commonplace throughout the world; however, in common with other animals, humans have not evolved in the ecological context of chronic light at night. With prevailing evidence linking the circadian, endocrine, immune, and metabolic systems, understanding these relationships is important to understanding the etiology and progression of several diseases. To eliminate the covariate of <re> sleep <er> disruption in light at night studies, researchers often use nocturnal animals. However, the assumption that light at night does not affect <re> sleep <er> in nocturnal animals remains unspecified. To test the effects of light at night on <re> sleep <er>, we maintained Swiss-Webster <el> mice <le> in standard light/dark (LD) or dim light at night (DLAN) conditions for 8-10 wks and then measured electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) biopotentials via wireless telemetry over the course of two consecutive days to determine differences in <re> sleep <er> timing and homeostasis. Results show no statistical differences in total percent time, number of episodes, maximum or average episode durations in wake, slow-wave <re> sleep <er> (SWS), or rapid eye movement (REM) <re> sleep <er>. No differences were evident in SWS delta power, an index of <re> sleep <er> drive, between groups. Mice kept in DLAN conditions showed a relative increase in REM <re> sleep <er> during the first few hours after the dark/light transition. Both groups displayed normal 24-h circadian rhythms as measured by voluntary running wheel activity. Groups did not differ in body mass, but a marked negative correlation of body mass with percent time spent awake and a positive correlation of body mass with time spent in SWS was evident. Elevated body mass was also associated with shorter maximum wake episode durations, indicating heavier animals had more trouble remaining in the wake vigilance state for extended periods of time. Body mass did not correlate with activity levels, nor did activity levels correlate with time spent in different <re> sleep <er> states. These data indicate that heavier animals tend to <re> sleep <er> more, potentially contributing to further weight gain. 
Potassium-depleted rats receiving sodium chloride or i.v. mannitol decrease their blood <re> bicarbonate <er> concentration isohydrically, reduce urinary citrate, and increase urinary <el> ammonia <le> excretion per milligram of urinary creatinine. To determine the mechanisms of these renal changes, we volume expanded normal rats with mannitol, normal saline, or saline <re> bicarbonate <er> solutions. Blood pH in each group remained constant, but blood <re> bicarbonate <er> fell significantly in the mannitol and saline-infused  rats. In these two groups, urinary citrate per unit GFR decreased 27% and 25% (P less than 0.01) but urinary <el> ammonia <le> excretion per unit GFR increased 120% and 90% (P less than 0.01). By contrast, in saline <re> bicarbonate <er> rats, citrate excretion increased 27% and urinary <el> ammonia <le> excretion rose 29% (P greater than 0.2). Rats with metabolic acidosis given saline did not alter blood pH or <re> bicarbonate <er>. Citrate excretion  per unit GFR increased 150% (P less than 0.02) but urinary <el> ammonia <le> excretion rose insignificantly by 11%. Calculated net tubular reabsorption of citrate increased in the mannitol and saline-infused rats. The rise in urinary pH in these two groups during expansion suggest that renal <el> ammonia <le> production was also increased. 
A novel physiological cardiac assist device (<el> PCAD <le>), otherwise known as the LEVRAM assist device, which is synchronized with the heartbeat, was developed to assist the left ventricle (LV) in chronic heart failure (CHF). The <el> PCAD <le> utilizes a single cannula, which is inserted in less than 15 s through the apex of the beating LV by means of a specially designed device. Blood is withdrawn from the LV into the <el> PCAD <le> in diastole and is injected back to the LV, through the same cannula, during the systolic ejection phase, thereby augmenting stroke volume (SV) and stroke work (<re> SW <er>). CHF with dilated LV was induced in sheep by successive intracoronary injections of 100-microm beads. The sheep (92.2 +/- 25.9 kg, n = 5) developed stable CHF with increased LV end-diastolic diameter (69.4 +/- 3.3 mm) and end-diastolic volume (LVEDV = 239 +/- 32 mL), with severely reduced ejection fraction (23.8 +/- 7.6%), as well as mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation. The sheep were anesthetized, and the heart was exposed by left thoracotomy. Pressure was measured in the LV and aorta (Millar). The SV was measured by flow meters and the LV volume by sonocrystals. Assist was provided every 10 regular beats, and the assisted beats were compared with the preceding unassisted beats, at the same LVEDV. The <el> PCAD <le> displaced 13.6 +/- 3.4 mL, less than 8% of LVEDV. Added <re> SW <er> was calculated from the assisted and control pressure-volume loops. The efficiency, defined as an increase in <re> SW <er> divided by the mechanical work of the <el> PCAD <le>, was 85.4 +/- 16.9%. 
Levels of the selective <re> autophagy <er> substrate p62 have been established in recent years as a specific readout for basal autophagic activity. Here we compared different experimental approaches for using this assay in Drosophila larvae. Similar to the more commonly used western blots, quantifying p62 dots in immunostained fat body cells of L3 stage larvae detected a strong accumulation of endogenous p62 aggregates in null mutants for Atg genes and S6K. Importantly, genes whose mutation or silencing results in early stage lethality can only be analyzed by microscopy using clonal analysis. The loss of numerous general housekeeping genes show a phenotype in large-scale screens including <re> autophagy <er>, and the p62 assay was potentially suitable for distinguishing bona fide <re> autophagy <er> regulators from silencing of a DNA polymerase subunit or a ribosomal gene that likely has a non-specific effect on <re> autophagy <er>. p62 accumulation upon RNAi silencing of known <re> autophagy <er> regulators was dependent on the duration of the knockdown effect, unlike in the case of <el> starvation <le>-induced <re> autophagy <er>. The endogenous p62 assay was more sensitive than a constitutively overexpressed p62-GFP reporter, which showed self-aggregation and large-scale accumulation even in control cells. We recommend western blots for following the conversion of overexpressed p62-GFP reporters to estimate autophagic activity if sample collection from mutant larvae or adults is possible. In addition, we also showed that overexpressed p62 or Atg8 reporters can strongly influence the phenotypes of each other, potentially giving rise to false or contradicting results. 
We investigated whether low-level addition of selenium (<el> Se <le>) could decrease mercury (<re> Hg <er>) in freshwater fish without imposing <el> Se <le> toxicity. Using a regression design, selenite was added to large mesocosms in a lake to achieve target concentrations ≤1.6 μg/L. (198)<re> Hg <er> (spike <re> Hg <er>) was added to mesocosms to determine changes in <re> Hg <er> bioaccumulation. Adding <el> Se <le> decreased spike total <re> Hg <er> (THg) in fish muscle, ambient THg in fish liver, and bioaccumulation of spike THg in muscle and spike methylmercury (MeHg) in zooplankton and Chironomid larvae relative to controls. <el> Se <le> decreased <re> Hg <er> in the food web but not in water, indicating that the dominant effect of <el> Se <le> on <re> Hg <er> cycling occurs in the food web. Concentrations of <el> Se <le> in gonads of fish were positively correlated with <el> Se <le> concentrations in water but did not exceed reproductive toxicity thresholds after 8 weeks. 
Recent data indicate that the heat shock response inhibits nuclear translocation of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-kappaB. Under basal conditions NF-kappaB is retained in the cytoplasm by an inhibitory protein called I-kappaB which exists as two major isoforms: I-kappaBalpha and I-kappaBbeta. Induction of the heat shock response in BEAS-2B cells, a human cell line representative of bronchial epithelium, increased expression of <el> I-kappaBalpha mRNA <le> in a time-dependent manner. Coincubation with actinomycin-D inhibited heat shock-mediated expression of <el> I-kappaBalpha mRNA <le>. Transient transfection assays with a plasmid containing the reporter gene firefly luciferase, under the control of the human <re> I-kappaBalpha promoter <er>, demonstrated that heat shock activated the <re> I-kappaBalpha promoter <er>. Heat shock-mediated induction of I-kappaBalpha was associated with inhibition of NF-kappaB activation. 
Antiandrogens can be distinguished into three categories: those realizing a biochemical castration, those acting only at the target cell level by competitive inhibition of androgen binding to their receptor, and those doing both. In the first category enter mainly LHRH agonists and steroidogenesis inhibitors. LHRH agonists act through pituitary desensitization and have the inconvenient of an initial stimulation (flare-up) resulting in a lag before efficiency can be obtained. In addition, they do not suppress adrenal androgens. Steroidogenesis enzymes inhibitors can never realize a complete block and, due to negative feed-back control, circulating androgens progressively increase again after a while. Non steroidal antiandrogens interact with the androgen receptor thus preventing androgen action by competitive inhibition. However, as they also interact with the androgen receptor at the hypothalamic level, the resulting progressive increase in circulating androgens may overcome the peripheral inhibition at the receptor level. Their use is therefore restricted to castrated (surgically of biochemically) subjects, to suppress the effects of adrenal androgens or of the initial flare-up under LHRH agonists. As they have no antigonadotropic action, they must be associated in women with some kind of contraception. In contrast, the main progestational antiandrogen used, cyproterone acetate (<el> CPA <le>), has antigonadotropic effects which suppress androgen production and realizes at the same time an efficient contraception in women. It interacts with the androgen receptor and thus inhibits the action at the target cell site of any remaining androgens. In addition, it lowers the androgen dependent 5 alpha-reductase of human skin and has a weak agonist effect on liver protein synthesis resulting in an increased metabolic clearance rate of <re> testosterone <er>. 
Regenerative capacity appears to be impaired in sarcopenic muscle. As local growth factors and myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) modulate repair/<re> regeneration <er> responses after overload, we hypothesized that resistance loading (RL)-induced expression of MRFs and muscle IGF-I-related genes would be blunted in older (O) males (M) and females (F) with demonstrable sarcopenia vs. young (Y) adults. Y (20-35 yr, 10 YF, 10 YM) and O (60-75 yr, 9 OF, 9 OM) underwent vastus lateralis biopsy before and 24 h after knee extensor RL. Sarcopenia was assessed by cross-sectional area of type I, IIa, and IIx myofibers. Transcript levels were assessed by relative RT-PCR and analyzed by age x gender x load repeated-measures ANOVA. O were sarcopenic based on type II atrophy with smaller type IIa (P < 0.05) and IIx (P < 0.001) myofibers. Within-gender cross-sectional area differences were more marked in F (OF < YF: IIa 21%, IIx 42%). Load effects (P < 0.05) were seen for four of seven mRNAs as IGF-IEa (34%), <el> myogenin <le> (53%), and MyoD (20%) increased, and myf-6 declined 10%. Increased IGF-IEa was driven by O (48%) and/or M (43%). An age x gender x load interaction was found for MyoD (P < 0.05). An age x load interaction for type 1 IGF receptor (P < 0.05) was driven by a small increase in O (16%, P < 0.05). A gender x load interaction (P < 0.05) was noted for IGF binding protein-4. Age effects (P < 0.05) resulted from higher MyoD (54%), myf-5 (21%), and IGF binding protein-4 (17%) in O and were primarily localized to F at baseline (OF > YF; MyoD 94%, myf-5 47%, P < 0.05). 
1. The pathogenesis of the selective degeneration of the <el> dopamine <le>rgic neurons in Parkinson's disease is still enigmatic. Recently we have shown that <el> dopamine <le> can induce <re> apoptosis <er> in postmitotic neuronal cells, as well as in other cellular systems, thus suggesting a role for this endogenous neurotransmitter and associated oxidative stress in the neuronal death process. 2. Dopamine has been shown to be capable of inducing DNA damage through its oxidative metabolites. p53 is a transcription factor that has a major role in determining cell fate in response to DNA damage. We therefore examined the possible correlation between <el> dopamine <le>-triggered <re> apoptosis <er>, DNA damage and levels of total phosphorylated p53 protein in cultured mouse cerebellar granule neurons. 3. Marked DNA damage and apoptotic nuclear condensation and fragmentation were detected within several hours of exposure to <el> dopamine <le>. An associated marked threefold increase in p53 phosphorylation was observed within this time window. Using a temperature-sensitive p53 activation system in leukemia LTR6 cells, were found that p53 inactivation dramatically attenuated <el> dopamine <le> toxicity. 4. 
Membrane blebbing-dependent (blebby) amoeboid migration can be employed by lymphoid and cancer cells to invade 3D-environments. Here, we reveal a mechanism by which the small GTPase RhoB controls membrane blebbing and blebby amoeboid migration. Interestingly, while all three Rho isoforms (RhoA, RhoB and RhoC) regulated amoeboid migration, each controlled motility in a distinct manner. In particular, RhoB depletion blocked membrane blebbing in ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia), melanoma and lung cancer cells as well as ALL cell amoeboid migration in 3D-collagen, while RhoB overexpression enhanced blebbing and 3D-collagen migration in a manner dependent on its plasma membrane <re> localization <er> and down-stream effectors ROCK and Myosin II RhoB <re> localization <er> was controlled by endosomal trafficking, being internalized via Rab5 vesicles and then trafficked either to late endosomes/lysosomes or to Rab11-positive recycling endosomes, as regulated by <el> KIF13A <le>. Importantly, <el> KIF13A <le> depletion not only inhibited RhoB plasma membrane <re> localization <er>, but also cell membrane blebbing and 3D-migration of ALL cells. 
The accumulation of hydrophobic bile acid, such as glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), in the liver has been thought to induce hepatocellular damage in human chronic cholestatic liver diseases. We previously reported that GCDCA-induced apoptosis was promoted by both mitochondria-mediated and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated pathways in rat hepatocytes. In this study, we elucidated the relationship between these pathways in GCDCA-induced apoptotic HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were treated with GCDCA (100-500microM) with or without a <el> caspase-8 <le> inhibitor, Z-IETD-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-IETD-FMK) (30microM) for 3-24h. We demonstrated the presence of both apoptotic pathways in these cells; that is, we showed increases in cleaved caspase-3 proteins, the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and the expression of ER resident molecular chaperone Bip mRNA and <re> ER stress response <er>-associated transcription factor Chop mRNA. On the other hand, pretreatment with Z-IETD-FMK significantly reduced the increases, compared with treatment with GCDCA alone. Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis showed that treatment with GCDCA increased the cleavage of BAP31, an integral membrane protein of ER, and pretreatment with Z-IETD-FMK suppressed the increase of <el> caspase-8 <le> and BAP31 cleavage. 
This study was undertaken to compare the effects of chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on blood pressure (BP) and renal hemodynamics in older black and nonblack hypertensive patients with <re> chronic renal insufficiency <er>. A multicenter, placebo lead-in double-blind, parallel group study was performed to compare the antihypertensive efficacy and renal hemodynamic response to the once-daily ACE inhibitor fosinopril (n = 14) and <el> lisinopril <le> (n = 13) over a 22-week period. The study goal was to lower diastolic blood pressure (DBP) to 90 mm Hg or less. Furosemide was added after 6 weeks if blood pressure goal was not achieved. At outpatient clinics at university medical centers, 27 older hypertensive patients (> or = 45 years; 12 blacks, 15 nonblacks; 19 male, eight female) with DBP of 95 mm Hg or higher and 4-hour creatinine clearance 20 to 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 were studied. Changes (delta) from baseline in BP, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and renal plasma flow (RPF) were measured. Mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) and DBP decreased significantly and to a similar extent in randomized groups: fosinopril (mean +/- SEM) delta DBP at 6 weeks was -13 +/- 2 (P < 0.0001; 95% CI, -16 to -9) and at 22 weeks was -12 +/- 2 (P < 0.0001; 95% CI, -16 to -9); <el> lisinopril <le> delta DBP at 6 weeks was -14 +/- 6 (P < 0.0001; 95% CI, -10 to -18) and at 22 weeks was -16 +/- 2 (P < 0.0001; 95% CI, -12 to -21). GFR and RPF did not change significantly in either group. BP was significantly reduced and to a similar extent in blacks and nonblacks: for blacks, delta DBP at 6 weeks was -11 +/- 3 (P < 0.05; 95% CI, -0.01 to -9) and at 22 weeks was -16 +/- 2 (P < 0.0001; 95% CI, -11 to -20); for nonblacks, delta DBP at 6 weeks was -14 +/- 1 (P < 0.0001; 95% CI, -12 to -17) and at 22 weeks was -12 +/- 2 (P < 0.0001; 95% CI, -16 to -8). Eight patients (five blacks and three nonblacks) required an addition of furosemide after 6 weeks to reach the DBP goal of < or = 90 mm Hg at 22 weeks. GFR was not significantly altered for either racial group at 6 weeks; however, at 22 weeks; however, at 22 weeks, GFR decreased significantly in blacks (delta GFR, -16 +/- 5; P < 0.006; 95% CI, -26 to -5) and tended to increase in nonblacks (delta GFR, 7 +/- 6; P > 0.25). delta GFR correlated directly with the delta RPF (delta GFR = 0.0611* delta RPF -2.35 +; r = 0.68; P < 0.003). There was no correlation between delta MAP and delta GFR or delta RPF in blacks or nonblacks. 
The toxicity and efficacy of <el> dapsone <le> given daily as Pneumocystis jiroveci (<re> PCP <er>) prophylaxis in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients who cannot take trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) have not been fully evaluated. We compared 155 HSCT recipients who received daily <el> dapsone <le> as second-line <re> PCP <er> prophylaxis with 310 matched control patients who received TMP-SMX throughout the posttransplantation course. Among patients who started <el> dapsone <le> before transplantation because of TMP-SMX allergy, there was no difference in the transfusion requirement after HSCT when compared with controls. Among patients who started <el> dapsone <le> after transplantation, increased red blood cell ( P<.0001) and platelet transfusion ( P=.003) requirements were noted compared with controls. This effect was, however, limited to patients who were receiving <el> dapsone <le> for reasons (mostly neutropenia) other than TMP-SMX allergy. Two of 155 patients developed <re> PCP <er>, compared with 0 of 310 controls ( P=.11); both patients survived. 
ADP-ribosylation of Rho(A,B,C) by the family of exoenzyme C3-like transferases induces reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton based on inactivation of RhoA. No data are available on the role of <re> RhoB <er> in C3-treated cells. In murine fibroblasts treated with the cell-permeable exoenzyme C3 from Clostridium limosum (C3), an increase in the level of <re> RhoB <er> was observed. This upregulation of <re> RhoB <er> was based on transcriptional activation, as it was responsive to inhibition by actinomycin D and accompanied by activation of the rhoB promoter. Upregulation of <re> RhoB <er> was not observed in cells treated with either the actin ADP-ribosylating C2 toxin from Clostridium botulinum or latrunculin B, suggesting that inactivation of Rho but not actin reorganization was required for the upregulation of <re> RhoB <er>. This notion was confirmed, as the Rho/Rac/Cdc42-glucosylating toxin B from Clostridium difficile (TcdB) but not the Rac/R-<el> Ras <le>-glucosylating variant toxin B from C. difficile strain 1470 serotype F (TcdBF) induced a strong upregulation of <re> RhoB <er>. Upregulation of <re> RhoB <er> was further observed in response to the Rac/(H-,K-,N-,R-)<el> Ras <le>-glucosylating lethal toxin from Clostridium sordellii. The level of active, GTP-bound <re> RhoB <er> was increased in TcdB-treated cells compared to untreated cells (as determined by Rhotekin pull-down assay). In contrast, no active <re> RhoB <er> was found in C3-treated cells. <re> RhoB <er>-GTP was required for the TcdB-induced apoptosis (cytotoxic effect), as this effect was responsive to inhibition by C3. 
This study was designed to evaluate the effect of diluting <el> fentanyl <le> 50 microg x ml(-1) to 25 or 10 microg x ml(-1) with 0.9% saline and prolonged injection time on <el> fentanyl <le>-induced <re> cough <er>. Two hundred patients requiring general anaesthesia were randomly allocated into four groups: 50 microg x ml(-1) (Group I), 25 microg x ml(-1) (Group II), 10 microg x ml(-1) (Group III) or 10 microg x ml(-1) combined with prolonged injection (Group IV). Fentanyl 3 microg x kg(-1) was administered within 5 s in Groups I, II, and III, or over 30 s in Group IV. Occurrence of <re> cough <er> was significantly reduced in Group IV (2% vs 32%, 16% and 12% in Groups I, II and III, respectively, p < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in the severity of <re> cough <er>ing between the four groups (p > 0.05). 
In view of the potent mitogenic effect exerted by <re> insulin <er> in human colonic cells, we used Caco-2 cells transfected with an activated (Val12) human Ha-ras gene or the polyoma middle T (PyMT) oncogene, a constitutive activator of <el> pp60c-src <le> tyrosine kinase activity, to investigate the effect of oncogenic p21ras and PyMT/<el> pp60c-src <le> on <re> insulin <er> mitogenic signaling. As compared to vector control Caco-2 cells, both oncogene-transfected cells exhibited: 1) a lost of response to <re> insulin <er>'s stimulatory effect on mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity and cell proliferation, both of which were constitutively increased; 2) a decrease in <re> insulin <er> receptor (IR) affinity and <re> insulin <er>-stimulated exogenous tyrosine kinase activity, which resulted, at least in part, from increased protein kinase C (PKC) activity (4), since both IR alterations were partially corrected by PKC down-regulation; and 3) a decrease in both <re> insulin <er> receptor mRNA level and <re> insulin <er> receptor number, which was independent of PKC since it persisted after PKC down-regulation. 
The objective of this study was to determine whether oral administration of <el> omeprazole <le>, a proton-pump inhibitor, increased abomasal luminal <re> pH <er> in calves fed milk replacer. Four male dairy calves with cannulae in the abomasal body suckled milk replacer (60 ml/kg body weight every 12 h) and were administered a non-enteric-coated <el> omeprazole <le> (4 mg/kg body weight every 24 h) in a paste formulation for five successive days. Abomasal luminal <re> pH <er> was continuously measured using miniature glass <re> pH <er> electrodes. On the first day of <el> omeprazole <le> administration, there was a significant (P<0.05) increase in mean 24-h <re> pH <er> from 2.89 to 4.17. The mean 24-h <re> pH <er> on days 2, 3, 4 and 5 of <el> omeprazole <le> administration were 3.85, 4.02, 3.97 and 3.39 respectively. 
The mammalian adrenal medulla expresses a variety of both <el> opioid peptides <le> and opioid receptors. The function of this adrenal opioid system is, however, largely unknown. We have examined the ability of a number of opioid compounds to influence basal and muscarinic stimulated accumulation of <re> inositol phosphate <er>s in cultured bovine chromaffin cells. Muscarine produced a dose-dependent 1.5-fold increase in total <re> inositol phosphate <er>s. This response was sensitive to atropine inhibition. The ten opioid compounds examined were chosen because between them they possess selectivity for all of the identified opioid receptor subtypes. However, none of these opioids in the concentration range 10nM-10 microM had any significant effect on either basal or muscarinic induced total <re> inositol phosphate <er> accumulation. 
Methotrexate (<re> MTX <er>) induces a concentration-dependent accumulation of cells in S-phase, an increase in average cell size and RNA and protein content ('unbalanced growth') and finally induces cell death. Even after high-dose <re> MTX <er> treatment, however, some cells escape the drug effect and this heterogeneity in response may play a major role in therapeutic outcome. We investigated heterogeneity in the response of K562 human leukemia cells, which exhibited population characteristics of unbalanced growth when treated with <re> MTX <er>, including a concentration-dependent increase in average-cell size and a block in S-phase of the cell cycle that correlated with growth inhibition. To investigate for the first time the response to <re> MTX <er> at the individual cell level, an individual colony formation assay (iCFA) was used. The iCFA revealed marked heterogeneity in both untreated K562 cells and their response to <re> MTX <er> treatment, as well as distinctive features of the response. Colonies of untreated K562 cells grew logarithmically with modal doubling times of 21.9 h (compared to 18.8+/-1.1 h in suspension culture), but there was over a 2-fold range of doubling times for individual cells. In addition, there was heterogeneity in the size of individual untreated K562 cells. Following <re> MTX <er> treatment, the iCFA detected shifts in the growth rate that were not detected in suspension culture and also drug-induced increased heterogeneity in growth rates at relatively nontoxic <re> MTX <er> concentrations. More importantly, the iCFA demonstrated that at a <re> MTX <er> concentration where no cells reproduced sufficiently to reach the threshold necessary to be counted as a colony, continued slow, logarithmic growth of a number of individual cells was observed. Thus, in addition to cytotoxicity, growth slow-down was a major effect exhibited in K562 cells treated with <re> MTX <er>. There was no correlation between <re> MTX <er>-induced unbalanced growth (as indicated by an increase in individual cell size) and the proliferative capacity of each cell. At cytotoxic <re> MTX <er> concentrations, there were individual cells that showed dramatically increased cell size but continued to proliferate, while other cells did not enlarge, but were still killed. These data show directly for the first time that the increase in cell size following <re> MTX <er> treatment is not likely to be the primary mechanism of cell kill. Similar changes were observed with gamma-fluoromethotrexate (<el> FMTX <le>), an <re> MTX <er> analog which is deficient in polyglutamylation. 
Although <el> leptin <le> has been found to be implicated in obesity-related breast carcinogenesis in postmenopausal women, the molecular mechanisms involved are yet to be defined. Recently, the antiapoptotic gene survivin has been recognized as a target gene for <el> leptin <le> in breast cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of <el> leptin <le> on the expression of survivin and on the transcriptional activity of its promoter in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. We also studied the potential involvement of SOCS-3 (a negative regulator of <el> leptin <le>'s main signaling pathway <re> JAK2 <er>/STAT3) in the expression of <el> leptin <le>-mediated survivin. Our results showed a significant increase in the mRNA (dose-dependent increase of 40-70%) and protein expression levels of survivin 24 h post-<el> leptin <le> treatment, which was followed by a significant decrease at 48 and 72 h (of 60-70%). In accordance, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed an initial strong binding of STAT3 to the survivin promoter, which was no longer detected after 24 h. Myc/mad/max network proteins and histone H3 acetylation status were not found to contribute to the expression of <el> leptin <le>-mediated survivin. Furthermore, a protein immunoprecipitation assay detected an enhanced SOCS-3 binding to the long isoform of <el> leptin <le>'s receptor (Ob-Rb) 48 and 72 h after <el> leptin <le> administration, thus conferring inhibition to <el> leptin <le> signaling. 
The influence of endogenous prostaglandins on <el> secretin <le>-mediated inhibition of <re> gastric acid secretion <er> was examined in 6 mongrel dogs with Thomas gastric and Herrera pancreatic cannulas. The dogs were given intravenous pentagastrin (1 microgram/kg.h) during the 180-min experiment, and graded doses of <el> secretin <le> (0.3-1.5 micrograms/kg.h) (1-5 CU/kg.h) were infused intravenously between 60 and 120 min. In alternate, otherwise identical experiments, a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, either indomethacin or meclofenamate, was also administered throughout the experiment. Increasing doses of <el> secretin <le> led to increasing inhibition of gastric acid output with the maximum inhibition at 1 microgram/kg.h (3.3 CU/kg.h) of <el> secretin <le>. Both indomethacin and meclofenamate abolished the inhibitory effects of <el> secretin <le> on <re> gastric acid secretion <er>. The inhibitors of prostaglandin generation had no effect on the serotonin system. 
The upregulation of the tetrodotoxin-resistant voltage-gated sodium channel <el> NaV1.9 <le> has previously been associated with inflammatory hyperalgesia. Na1.9 knockout (KO) <re> mice <er>, however, did not seem insensitive in conventional tests of acute nociception. Using electrophysiological, neurochemical, and behavioral techniques, we now show <el> NaV1.9 <le>-null <re> mice <er> exhibit impaired mechanical and thermal sensory capacities and reduced electrical excitability of nociceptors. In single-fiber recordings from isolated skin, the electrical threshold of <el> NaV1.9 <le> KO C fibers was elevated by 55% and the median von Frey threshold was 32 mN in contrast to 8 mN in wild types (WTs). The prevalence of C mechano-heat-sensitive (CMH) fibers was only 25.6% in <el> NaV1.9 <le> KO animals compared to 75.8% in the WT group, and the heat threshold of these CMH fibers was 40.4°C in the control vs 44°C in the KO group. Compound action potential recordings from isolated sciatic nerve segments of <el> NaV1.9 <le> KO <re> mice <er> revealed lower activity-induced slowing of conduction velocity upon noxious heat stimulation: 8% vs 30% in WTs. Heat-induced calcitonin gene-related peptide release from the skin was less in the KO than in the WT group. The reduced noxious heat sensitivity was finally confirmed with the Hargreaves test using 2 rates of radiant heating of the plantar hind paws. 
Chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension involves both vasoconstriction and <re> vascular remodeling <er>. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) have an increased systemic vascular resistance and a greater responsiveness to constricting stimuli. We hypothesized that, in contrast to age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), SHR also display spontaneous pulmonary hypertension in normoxia and increased vascular response to acute and chronic <el> hypoxia <le>. Baseline mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and total pulmonary resistance (TPR) were higher in SHR than in WKY. With acute <el> hypoxia <le> (10% O2 for 15 min), PAP increased to the same extent in SHR and WKY and cardiac output (CO) was unchanged in WKY but increased in SHR. Thus, the rise in PAP in the SHR might be accounted for by the rise in CO, as TPR did not rise, but not that in the WKY, as TPR increased. After 12 days in <el> hypoxia <le> (10% O2), mean arterial pressure was unchanged in WKY but decreased significantly in SHR without a change in CO. PAP increased by 59% in SHR and 54% in WKY when the rats were taken from the hypoxic chamber for 1 h. Acute hypoxic challenge caused a further increase in PAP only in WKY. Medial wall thickness of alveolar duct and terminal bronchial vessels was similar in WKY and SHR after chronic <el> hypoxia <le>. 
The active form of vitamin D(3), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)), induces caspase-independent <re> apoptosis <er> in MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cells. Before the appearance of apoptotic cells at Day 4 after the addition of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), the MCF-7 cells are sensitized to the caspase-mediated <re> apoptosis <er> induced by <el> TNF <le>. We studied the mechanism underlying the cross talk between these 2 distinct death pathways in MCF-7 and T47D cells. Whereas 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) pre-treatment enhanced <el> TNF <le>-induced <re> apoptosis <er> of <el> TNF <le> sensitive MCF-7 cells, it failed to render <el> TNF <le> resistant T47D cells sensitive to this cytokine. Opposing to an earlier report suggesting that cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) mediates the 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-induced sensitization to <el> TNF <le>, we could not detect any cPLA(2) protein in MCF-7 cells and its overexpression had no effect on cellular sensitivity to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) or the combination with <el> TNF <le>. The sensitization of MCF-7 cells to <el> TNF <le>-induced <re> apoptosis <er> by pre-treatment with 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) may instead be partially explained by an increased surface expression of the <el> TNF <le> receptor 1 (<el> TNF <le>-R1). In line with this, not only the <el> TNF <le>-induced activation of caspases and <re> apoptosis <er> but also that of NF-kappaB was enhanced by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) pre-treatment. Furthermore, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) enhanced <el> TNF <le>-induced NF-kappaB activation in T47D cells suggesting that it potentiates <el> TNF <le> signaling in general. Interestingly, the lysosomal protease cathepsin B, which expression is up-regulated by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), was released from the lysosomes upon <el> TNF <le> treatment, and inhibition of its activity rescued 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) treated MCF-7 cells from <el> TNF <le>-induced <re> apoptosis <er>. 
Fenfluramine, an anorectic used in the treatment of obesity, in a final concentration of 1 mM strongly inhibited both phases of insulin release by the perfused rat pancreas. Insulin secretion resumed promptly after cessation of the drug infusion. This concentration of the drug markedly increased <re> glucagon <er> output. The blockade of alpha-adrenergic receptors and the use of antiserotonin agents did not alter the inhibitory effect of fenfluramine on <el> insulin secretion <le>. 
The proteolytic fragments of the nuclear <re> estrogen receptor <er> in the MCF-7 cell line were characterized following limited digestion with <el> chymotrypsin <le> and trypsin. Nuclei were isolated from cells previously exposed to 10 nM [3H]estradiol. The proteolytic digestion was performed either on the micrococcal nuclease hydrolysate or on intact nuclei. The molecular weights (Mr) were calculated from the sedimentation coefficients determined on a sucrose gradient and from the Stokes radii estimated by gel filtration. Digestion of the nuclei with micrococcal nuclease solubilized a receptor form of Mr = 151,000. This receptor form was degraded by <el> chymotrypsin <le> to a receptor of Mr = 33,000 and by trypsin to a receptor of Mr = 60,000. Digestion of intact nuclei with <el> chymotrypsin <le> solubilized a receptor form of Mr = 62,000 which dissociated in 0.4 M KCl to a receptor of Mr = 32,000. Digestion of intact nuclei with trypsin followed by micrococcal nuclease solubilized a receptor form of Mr = 75,000 which was further dissociated by 0.4 M KCl to a receptor form of Mr = 60,000. The ability of the receptor forms to bind DNA was tested using DNA-cellulose column chromatography. About 40% of the micrococcal nuclease solubilized receptor form, compared to about 7% of the <el> chymotrypsin <le> degraded receptor and to about 13% of the trypsin degraded receptor forms, all bound to the column and could be eluted by high salt concentrated buffer. 
Thioredoxin (<re> Trx <er>) is an important redox regulator with cytosolic <re> Trx <er>1 and mitochondrial <re> Trx <er>2 isozymes. <re> Trx <er> has multiple physiological functions in cells and its bioavailability is negatively controlled through active-site binding to a specific thioredoxin-binding protein (<el> TBP-2 <le>). This paper describes the delicate balance between <el> TBP-2 <le> and <re> Trx <er> and the effect of overexpression of <el> TBP-2 <le> in human lens epithelial cells. Cells overexpressing <el> TBP-2 <le> (<el> TBP-2 <le> OE) showed a sevenfold increase in <el> TBP-2 <le> and a nearly 40% suppression of <re> Trx <er> activity but no change in <re> Trx <er> expression. The <el> TBP-2 <le> OE cells grew slower and their population decreased to 30% by day 7. Cell cycle analysis showed that <el> TBP-2 <le> OE cells arrested at the G2/M stage and that they displayed low expression of the cell cycle elements P-cdc2(Y15), cdc2, cdc25A, and cdc25C. Furthermore, <el> TBP-2 <le> OE cells were more sensitive to oxidation. Under H2O2 (200μM, 24h) treatment, these cells lost 80% viability and became highly apoptotic. Brief oxidative stress (200μM, 30min) to <el> TBP-2 <le> OE cells disrupted the <re> Trx <er> antiapoptotic function by dissociating the cytosolic and mitochondrial <re> Trx <er>-ASK binding complexes. The same H2O2-treated cells also showed activated ASK (P-ASK), increased Bax, lowered Bcl-2, cytochrome c release, and elevated caspase 3/7 activity. 
The tripeptide amide glycyl-prolyl-<re> glycinamide <er> (GPG-amide) is a new antiretroviral drug candidate, but its absorption mechanism is unknown. In this investigation, the transport and metabolism of GPG-amide were studied in a model of the human intestinal epithelium, Caco-2 cell monolayers. The results show that when the tripeptide amide came into contact with the apical enterocyte membrane, it was degraded by <el> CD26 <le> (dipeptidyl peptidase IV) to glycylproline and the antiretrovirally active metabolite <re> glycinamide <er>. Glycinamide retained antiretroviral activity in vitro after transport through the Caco-2 cell monolayers. The transport of <re> glycinamide <er> across Caco-2 cell monolayers occurred via passive diffusion with an apparent permeability coefficient of about 2 x 10(-6) cm s(-1), which suggests that it is absorbed by the oral route in sufficient amounts to be considered for oral administration. 
Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) is not only involved in the physiologic regulation of excitation-contraction coupling, but could also play a role in cardiac pathophysiology. We investigated the mechanism of <el> ketamine <le> modulation of norepinephrine (NE)-induced IP(3) formation in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Ketamine 1 and 10 microM significantly decreased the IP(3) response to 1 microM NE by 27% and 43%, respectively. One micromolar TMB-8 (an intracellular calcium antagonist) produced 42% more decreases in IP(3) production than produced by <el> ketamine <le> alone. One hundred micromolar anthranilic acid (a phospholipase A(2) inhibitor) significantly decreased NE (1 microM)-induced IP(3) formation, and the inhibition was further enhanced by <el> ketamine <le>. Ten micromolar U 73122 (a phospholipase C inhibitor) did not significantly affect <re> NE-induced IP <er>(3) in the presence or absence of <el> ketamine <le>. One micromolar <el> ketamine <le> significantly inhibited staurosporine (a nonselective protein kinase C antagonist)-, bisindolylmaleimide (a selective protein kinase C antagonist)-, and wortmannin (a phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase antagonist)-stimulated IP(3) formation. 
gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (<re> GABA <er>(A)-R) mediate synaptic inhibition and meet many pharmacological criteria required of important general anesthetic targets. During synaptic transmission <re> GABA <er> release is sufficient to saturate, maximally activate, and transiently desensitize postsynaptic <re> GABA <er>(A)-Rs. The resulting inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) are prolonged by volatile anesthetics like <el> isoflurane <le>. We investigated the effects of <el> isoflurane <le> on maximally activated and desensitized <re> GABA <er>(A)-R currents expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Wild-type alpha(1)beta(2) and alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2s) receptors were exposed to 600 microM <re> GABA <er> until currents reached a steady-state desensitized level. At clinical concentrations (0.02-0.3 mM), <el> isoflurane <le> produced a dose-dependent enhancement of steady-state desensitized current in alpha(1)beta(2) receptors, an effect that was less apparent in receptors including a gamma(2s)-subunit. When serine at position 270 is mutated to histidine (alpha(1)(S270H)) in the second transmembrane segment of the alpha(1)-subunit, the currents evoked by sub-saturating concentrations of <re> GABA <er> became less sensitive to <el> isoflurane <le> enhancement. In addition, <el> isoflurane <le> enhancements of desensitized currents were greatly attenuated by this mutation and were undetectable in alpha(1)(S270H)beta(2)gamma(2s) receptors. 
Gastrointestinal motor abnormalities may account for dyspeptic symptoms of chronic <el> uremia <le> patients. However, the data on <re> gastric emptying <er> are conflicting in human studies. We, therefore, assessed <re> gastric emptying <er> and gastrointestinal transit in a rat <el> uremia <le> model. Chronic <el> uremia <le> was induced by five-sixths nephrectomy in the rats. After 20-hour fasting, the rats were loaded with 70 glass beads as solid markers through a gastric catheter. Two hours later, the stomach was exposed and the small intestine was equally divided into 10 segments. The glass beads in the stomach and in each intestinal segment were counted. The <re> gastric emptying <er> was expressed as the ratio of the number of glass beads in the small intestine to that counted from the entire gastrointestinal tract. The intestinal transit was assessed by analyzing the geometric center of the distribution of glass beads in the intestinal segments. Two conventional nonabsorbable markers, radioactive chromate and charcoal, were also used to evaluate <re> gastric emptying <er> and intestinal transit in the fasted state. Additionally, similar experiments of glass beads were performed in the fed state. It was found that, in the fasted state, the <re> gastric emptying <er> and the intestinal transit of liquid or solid markers were little affected by <el> uremia <le>. In the fed state, however, chronic <el> uremia <le> significantly decreased the intestinal transit but hardly affected the <re> gastric emptying <er>. 
It has been confirmed that cholinergic synaptic vesicles isolated from the electric organ of Torpedo californica exhibit adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) dependent active uptake of [3H]acetylcholine. Active uptake can be completely inhibited by low concentrations of the mitochondrial uncouplers carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone, nigericin, gramicidin, valinomycin, and A 23187. Under similar conditions uncouplers stimulate the vesicle adenosinetriphosphatase (<el> ATPase <le>) by from 40 to 80%. ATP-supported uptake of [3H]acetylcholine increases greatly as the external pH is increased from 6.6 to 7.6 and remains approximately constant from pH 7.8 to pH 8.6. The uptake also becomes more selective for [3H]acetylcholine compared to [14C]choline as the pH is increased from 6.6 to 7.6, achieving 12-fold selectively, in a manner similar to the increase in the amount of [3H]acetylcholine taken up. Bicarbonate stimulates both the amount and selectivity of [3H]<re> acetylcholine uptake <er> over the lower pH range, but it has no effect over the higher pH range. Exogenous ammonium ion completely inhibits active [3H]<re> acetylcholine uptake <er>, with lower concentrations of ammonium ion required at higher pH values in a manner consistent with ammonia being the active species. Adenosine 5'-diphosphate and a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue do not support active [3H]<re> acetylcholine uptake <er>. 
Lipopolysaccharide (<el> LPS <le>), a Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 agonist, causes airway hyperreactivity through nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). Because NF-kappaB induces cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) to increase synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs), including the potent airway anti-inflammatory and smooth muscle relaxant PGE(2), we investigated whether <el> LPS <le> causes short-term PGE(2)-dependent relaxation of mouse isolated trachea. In rings of trachea contracted submaximally with carbachol, <el> LPS <le> caused slowly developing, epithelium-dependent relaxations that reached a maximum within 60 min. Fluorescence immunohistochemistry revealed TLR4-like immunoreactivity localized predominantly to the epithelium. The <el> LPS <le> antagonist polymixin B; the nonselective COX inhibitor indomethacin; the selective COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole (SC560) and 4-[5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]-benzenesulfonamide (SC236), respectively; the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D; the translation inhibitor cycloheximide; the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) inhibitor 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1H-imadazole (SB203580); and a combination of the mixed DP/EP1/<re> EP2 <er> receptor antagonist 6-isopropoxy-9-xanthone-2-carboxylic acid (AH6809) and the EP4 receptor antagonist 4'-[3-butyl-5-oxo-1-(2-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-1-5-dihydro-[1,2,4]triazol-4-ylmethyl]-biphenyl-2-sulfonic acid (3-methyl-thiophene-2-carbonyl)-amide (L-161982) all abolished relaxation to <el> LPS <le>, giving instead slowly developing, small contractions over 60 min. The cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) inhibitor 1,1,1-trifluoro-6Z,9Z, 12Z,15Z-heneicosateraen-2-one significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited the relaxation to <el> LPS <le>, whereas the NF-kappaB proteasomal inhibitor Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-aldehyde (MG-132) had no affect on the relaxation in the first 20 min, after which it reversed the response to a contraction. 
Neuropeptides including SP and <el> VIP <le> modulate <re> Ig secretion <er> by in vitro stimulated lymphocyte cultures. It is not known whether these neuropeptides effect the B cell directly, or if they significantly alter humoral immune responses to pathogens. We have previously shown that granulomas derived from schistosome-infected mice contain immunoglobulin secreting B cells (ISC) as well as eosinophils that secrete substance P (SP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (<el> VIP <le>). It therefore seemed plausible that B cells derived from infected animals might respond to these neuropeptides, and that such responses might effect immunoregulatory signals. In this study, we addressed these issues in the murine Schistosoma mansoni model, at the level of immunoglobulin secretion in single B cells. Spontaneous ISC were observed in both splenic and granuloma cell preparations. The addition of SP resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the number and size of plaques (a 50% reduction was observed at 10(-9) M). This effect was blocked with SP antagonists. Similar results were observed in T cell-depleted cell cultures. <el> VIP <le> had no effect on ISC number or plaque size. 
Microarray and real-time RT-PCR were used to examine expression changes in primary bone marrow cells and RAW 264.7 cells in response to <el> RANKL <le>. In silico sequence analysis was performed on a novel gene which we designate OC-STAMP. Specific siRNA and antibodies were used to inhibit OC-STAMP RNA and protein, respectively, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)+ multinucleated osteoclasts were counted. Antibodies were used to probe bone tissues and western blots of RAW cell extracts +/- <el> RANKL <le>. cDNA overexpression constructs were transfected into RAW cells and the effect on <el> RANKL <le>-induced differentiation was studied. OC-STAMP was very strongly up-regulated during osteoclast differentiation. Northern blots and sequence analysis revealed two transcripts of 2 and 3.7 kb differing only in 3'UTR length, consistent with predictions from genome sequence. The mRNA encodes a 498 amino acid, multipass <re> transmembrane protein <er> that is highly conserved in mammals. It has little overall homology to other proteins. The carboxy-terminal 193 amino acids, however, are significantly similar to the DC-STAMP family consensus sequence. DC-STAMP is a <re> transmembrane protein <er> required for osteoclast precursor fusion. Knockdown of OC-STAMP mRNA by siRNA and protein inhibition by antibodies significantly suppressed the formation of TRAP+, multinucleated cells in differentiating osteoclast cultures, with many TRAP+ mononuclear cells present. Conversely, overexpression of OC-STAMP increased osteoclastic differentiation of RAW 264.7 cells. 
Nitric oxide (<re> NO <er>) is undoubtedly a potential signal molecule in diverse developmental processes and stress responses. Despite our extensive knowledge about the role of <re> NO <er> in physiological and stress responses, the source of this gaseous molecule is still unresolved. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of nitrate reductase (NR) as the source of <re> NO <er> accumulation in the root system of wild-type and NR-deficient nia1, nia2 mutant Arabidopsis plants under osmotic stress conditions induced by a polyethylene glycol (<el> PEG <le> 6000) treatment. Reduction of primary root (PR) length was detected as the effect of osmotic stress in wild-type and NR-deficient plants. We found that osmotic stress-induced lateral root (LR) initiation in wild-type, but not in NR-mutant plants. High levels of <re> NO <er> formation occurred in roots of Col-1 plants as the effect of <el> PEG <le> treatment. The mammalian nitric oxide synthase (<re> NO <er>S) inhibitor N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) had no effect on LR initiation or <re> NO <er> generation, while tungstate, an NR inhibitor, inhibited the later phase of osmotic stress-induced <re> NO <er> accumulation and slightly decreased the LR development. In nia1, nia2 roots, the <el> PEG <le> treatment induced the first phase of <re> NO <er> production, but later <re> NO <er> production was inhibited. 
The present study was conducted to determine if progesterone (P4) would inhibit oxytocin-stimulated <re> phosphoinositide hydrolysis <er> in COS-7 cells expressing transfected ovine oxytocin receptor (<el> OTR <le>) with little or no nuclear P4 receptor (nPR) protein present. The relative absence of nPR in these cells was confirmed by immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR. To investigate the effects of P4 on oxytocin (OT) signaling, cells were transiently transfected with the ovine <el> OTR <le>. Radioreceptor assay for [(3)H]-OT binding confirmed the presence of a high affinity binding site for OT in transfected cells, while treatment with P4 and GTPgammaS (which uncouples the <el> OTR <le> from the heterotrimeric G-protein) increased the K(d) for OT binding slightly. Cells were then assayed for inositol phosphate hydrolysis 48 h post-transfection. Pre-treatment of cells with P4 for 10 min significantly interfered with rapid (20 min) OT-stimulated inositol trisphosphate (IP(3)) production. This inhibition was specific to P4, because pre-treatment of cells with promegestone (R5020), testosterone, mifepristone (RU 486), or cortisol did not decrease OT-stimulated IP(3) levels. By radioreceptor assay for PR, no measurable specific binding of R5020 was observed for either transfected or non-transfected cells. 
Glioblastoma progression is mainly characterized by intense <re> apoptosis <er> resistance and marked necrosis. Over-expression of BCL2L12, a novel member of Bcl-2 family has been shown in primary glioblastoma. BCL2L12 blocks effective caspase-3/7 maturation and inhibits p53 tumor suppressor, deriving resistance toward <re> apoptosis <er> and inducing extensive cell necrosis. Cisplatin is a major chemotherapeutic agent which has a broad range of anti-neoplastic activities including <re> apoptosis <er> induction. To investigate the effect of <el> cisplatin <le> on the expression of BCL2L12 in glioblastoma cells, two glioblastoma cell lines were treated with different concentrations of <el> cisplatin <le> for 48 h. The cell viability and IC50 was determined using MTT assay. Then, the two glioblastoma cell lines were treated with 48 h IC50 concentration of <el> cisplatin <le> for 24, 48, and 72 h. Apoptosis induction was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Gene expression study was performed on BCL2L12 and TBP as target and internal control genes, respectively. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction results showed that BCL2L12 gene expression was significantly (p = 0.001) downregulated in the presence of <el> cisplatin <le>. 
Serum amyloid A protein (<el> apo-SAA <le>), an acute phase reactant, is an apolipoprotein of high density lipoproteins (<re> HDL <er>), in particular the denser subpopulation <re> HDL <er>3. The structure of <re> HDL <er>3 isolated from humans affected by a variety of severe disease states was investigated with respect to density, size, and apolipoprotein composition, using density gradient ultracentrifugation, gradient gel electrophoresis, gel filtration, and solid phase immunoadsorption. Apo-SAA was present in <re> HDL <er> particles in increasing amounts as particle density increased. Apo-SAA-containing <re> HDL <er>3 had bigger radii than normal <re> HDL <er>3 of comparable density. Purified <el> apo-SAA <le> associated readily with normal <re> HDL <er>3 in vitro, giving rise to particles containing up to 80% of their apoproteins as <el> apo-SAA <le>. The addition of <el> apo-SAA <le> resulted in a displacement of apo-A-I and an increase in particle size. Acute phase <re> HDL <er>3 represented a mixture of particles, polydisperse with respect to apolipoprotein content; for example, some particles were isolated that contained apo-A-I, apo-A-II, and <el> apo-SAA <le>, whereas others contained apo-A-I and <el> apo-SAA <le> but no apo-A-II. 
The effects of intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (<el> cGMP <le>) on L-type calcium current (lCa) and contraction of ventricular myocytes enzymatically isolated from guinea pig hearts were investigated to test the hypothesis that <el> cGMP <le> increases contractions along with ICa in these cells. ICa and contractions, elicited every 15 sec, were recorded simultaneously with a whole-cell voltage-clamp method and a video edge-detector, respectively. Cells were superfused with Tyrode's solution (22 degrees C); the pipette solution contained 120 mM potassium aspartate, 30 mM KCl, 4 mM ATP, 5 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N-(2-ethanesulfonic acid), 0.01 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid and various concentrations of <el> cGMP <le>, which entered the cell interior through the patch electrode. In the presence of 3 nM isoproterenol (ISO) in the bath, ICa was increased 3.2-fold. ICa was further increased by 20% with 30 microM <el> cGMP <le>; cell contractions were also increased by 32%. When ICa was maximal in the presence of 30 nM ISO, <el> cGMP <le> no longer increased ICa or contractions, an indication that the effects of <el> cGMP <le> and ISO were additive. When ICa was increased maximally (4.3-fold) by 100 microM isobutylmethylxanthine, a nonselective <re> phosphodiesterase <er> inhibitor, application of 100 microM <el> cGMP <le> in the pipette decreased ICa by 53% and cell shortening by 64%. Cyclic GMP changed contraction in parallel with ICa in the presence of either ISO or isobutylmethylxanthine. 5'-GMP had no significant effect on ICa or contraction in the presence of ISO or isobutyl-methylxanthine. Cyclic GMP alone, at 30 microM, increased ICa by 25%; this effect on basal ICa was reversed by removal of <el> cGMP <le> from the pipette solution. 
Yokoshiki et al. (Yokoshiki, H., Sumii, K., Sperelakis, N., 1996. Inhibition of L-type calcium current in rat ventricular cells by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, <el> genistein <le> and its inactive analog, daidzein. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 28, 807-814) reported that <el> genistein <le> and daidzein inhibited L-type Ca2+ current (I(Ca)(L)) in young rat ventricular cells. Therefore, we investigated the developmental differences in the effect of <el> genistein <le>, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, on I(Ca)(L) in freshly-isolated neonatal (3-7 days) and adult (2-5 months) rat ventricular myocytes using whole-cell voltage clamp and single-channel recordings (cell-attached configuration). For whole-cell voltage clamp, I(Ca)(L) was measured as the peak inward current at a test potential of +10 mV by applying a 300 ms pulse from a holding potential of -40 mV. To isolate I(Ca(L), the pipette solution was Cs+-rich and the bath solution was Na+-, K+-free. Ca2+ (1.8 mM) was used as charge carrier. Bath application of 100 microM <el> genistein <le> (sufficient for maximal effect) decreased the <re> basal I(Ca)(L) <er> by 43.3% (n = 27) in neonatal cells and by 30.6% (n = 14) in adult cells (P < 0.05). In the current/voltage relationships, the potential of peak I(Ca)(L) was shifted to the right by <el> genistein <le> by 8.6 mV in neonatal and by 9.3 mV in adult cells. Genistein produced a shift of the steady-state inactivation curve (to the left) in neonatal cells (from -16.0 +/- 3.9 mV to -26.1 +/- 4.2 mV; P < 0.05) and in adult cells (-15.9 +/- 3.2 mV to -22.9 +/- 3.3 mV; P < 0.05); the slope factor was not affected. For single-channel recordings in cell-attached patches, Ca2+ currents were evoked by applying a 150 ms pulse from a holding potential of -40 mV to a test potential of 0 mV. The pipette solution contained 110 mM Ba2+ (as charge carrier), and the bath solution contained 150 mM K+ (to bring resting potential to near zero). Genistein (50 microM) decreased the open probability of the channels from 2.8% to 0.75% (P < 0.05) in absence of Bay K 8644, and from 24% to 7.9% (P < 0.05) in presence of Bay K 8644; the mean open time and the slope conductance of the currents were not affected. 
Cellular senescence, a form of cell-cycle arrest, is a tumor-suppressor mechanism triggered by multiple tumor-promoting insults, including oncogenic stress and <el> DNA damage <le>. The role of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) regulation has been evaluated in models of replicative senescence, but little is known regarding its role in other senescence settings. Using in vitro and in vivo models of <el> DNA damage <le>-and oncogene-induced <re> cellular senescence <er>, it was determined that activation of the tumor-suppressor protein p53 (TP53) resulted in repression of the CDK2 transcript that was dependent on intact RB. Ectopic CDK2 expression was sufficient to bypass p53-dependent senescence, and CDK2-specific inhibition, either pharmacologically (CVT313) or by use of a dominant-negative CDK2, was sufficient to induce early senescence. Pharmacologic inhibition of CDK2 in an in vivo model of pineal tumor decreased proliferation and promoted early senescence, and it also decreased tumor penetrance and prolonged time to tumor formation in animals lacking p53. 
A 23-year-old woman without history of antecedent vocal, respiratory, or <re> sleep <er> disorders received vagus nerve stimulation (<el> VNS <le>) therapy for refractory partial epilepsy and developed <re> sleep <er>-related stridor during the course of parameter titration. Reduction of <el> VNS <le> current during polysomnography completely eliminated stridor. 
Activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway induces inflammation, <el> apoptosis <le>, and fibrosis. However, little is known of the contribution of the upstream kinases, MMK3 and MKK6, to activation of the p38 kinase in the kidney and consequent renal injury. This study investigated the contribution of MKK3 to p38 MAPK activation and renal injury in the obstructed kidney. Groups of eight wild-type (WT) or Mkk3-/- mice underwent unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO) and were killed 3 or 7 days later. Western blotting showed a marked increase in phospho-p38 (p-p38) MAPK in UUO WT kidney. The same trend of increased p-p38 MAPK was seen in the UUO Mkk3-/- kidney, although the actual level of p-p38 MAPK was significantly reduced compared with WT, and this could not be entirely compensated for by the increase in MKK6 expression in the Mkk3-/- kidney. Apoptosis of tubular and interstitial cells in WT UUO mice was reduced by 50% in Mkk3-/- UUO mice. Furthermore, cultured Mkk3-/- tubular epithelial cells showed resistance to H(2)O(2)-induced <el> apoptosis <le>, suggesting a direct role for <re> MKK3-p38 <er> signaling in tubular <el> apoptosis <le>. Upregulation of MCP-1 mRNA levels and macrophage infiltration seen on day 3 in WT UUO mice was significantly reduced in Mkk3-/- mice, but this difference was not evident by day 7. The development of renal fibrosis in Mkk3-/- UUO mice was not different from that seen in WT UUO mice. 
CD2 mAb can inhibit T cell activation, but the mechanisms involved are still unclear. In this study, we identify the mAb <el> TS2/18 <le>, previously reported to bind to an epitope on the distal domain of the CD2 molecule at amino acids 87-99 (1), as a particularly potent inhibitor of T cell <re> cytokine synthesis <er>. Although <el> TS2/18 <le> is comitogenic with the CD2R mAb VIT13, this mAb combination does not induce the secretion of substantial amounts of cytokines. When added to T cells stimulated with the CD2 mAb pair OKT11-VIT13, <el> TS2/18 <le> efficiently blocks the induction of <re> cytokine synthesis <er> induced by that CD2 mAb pair, although it does not interfere with the binding of OKT11. In addition, <el> TS2/18 <le> inhibits the increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation and the accumulation of phosphatidic acid induced by either OKT11-VIT13 or a cross-linked CD3 mAb. Finally, <el> TS2/18 <le> disrupts CD2 clusters induced by the CD2 mAb pair OKT11-VIT13. 
The lipid mediator platelet-activating factor (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, AGEPC) has been shown to elicit several important biochemical signaling responses in mammalian cells, including polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis, <re> arachidonic acid release <er>/eicosanoid production, and protein tyrosine phosphorylation. In the present study, the roles of Ca2+ and protein kinase C (PKC), two signaling components of the <el> phospholipase <le> C pathway, in AGEPC-stimulated eicosanoid production and protein tyrosine phosphorylation, were investigated in cultured rat Kupffer cells. AGEPC at nanomolar concentrations induced an increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), stimulated membrane PKC activity, and resulted in protein tyrosine phosphorylation. The maximal increase in [Ca2+]i and membrane PKC activity in response to AGEPC were observed within 30-50 s, whereas the AGEPC-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation reached maximal levels within 2-5 min. [Ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid (EGTA) but not 8-(N,N-diethylamino)-octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate hydrochloride (TMB-8), an inhibitor of calcium release from intracellular compartments, nearly abolished the AGEPC-induced increase in [Ca2+]i suggesting involvement of extracellular calcium influx in this event. Both EGTA and TMB-8 abolished or inhibited AGEPC-stimulated protein tyrosine phosphorylation and eicosanoid formation, respectively. The calcium ionophore A23187 alone stimulated eicosanoid production and protein tyrosine phosphorylation with an identical pattern to that of AGEPC. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), an activator of PKC, which did not affect [Ca2+]i, mimicked the actions of AGEPC, stimulating eicosanoid production and promoting tyrosine phosphorylation of a set of proteins similar to those phosphorylated following AGEPC stimulation. AGEPC-enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of some of the protein substrates and eicosanoid production were inhibited in cells "down-regulated" for PKC. 
Frusemide has recently been shown to antagonise exercise-induced <re> bronchospasm <er>, an action attributed to blockade of chloride channels in the bronchial epithelium. In order to test the hypothesis that frusemide non-specifically antagonises <re> bronchospasm <er>, we tested the bronchial reactivity to inhaled <el> histamine <le> in ten subjects aged 22 to 35 years, after nebulising 30 mg of frusemide, and after nebulising the frusemide vehicle (water at pH 9.1). The geometric mean (<el> histamine <le> PD20) after inhalation of the solution was 0.6 mumol and after frusemide was 0.45 mumol. The mean difference in PD20 between control and frusemide was -0.50 mumol (frusemide test more reactive) but this change was not statistically significant. 
Glomerular mesangial cells (MCs) proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation have been recognized as major pathogenic events in the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Betulinic acid (BA), (3β-hydroxy-lup-20(29)-en-28-oic acid), is a naturally occurring pentacyclic lupane group triterpenoid, and it has been shown to possess glucose-lowering property. However, the role of BA on MC proliferation and ECM accumulation in diabetic condition remains unclear. So, in the present study, we investigated the role of BA on <re> cell proliferation <er> and ECM accumulation in rat glomerular MCs cultured under high glucose (<el> HG <le>) condition. In the current study, we demonstrated that BA suppressed <el> HG <le>-induced MC proliferation, arrested <el> HG <le>-induced cell-cycle progression, reversed <el> HG <le>-inhibited expression of p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1). It also suppressed <el> HG <le>-induced fibronectin (FN) expression in MCs. Furthermore, BA inhibited <el> HG <le>-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38MAPK in MCs. 
We have investigated the role of cellular p21ras protein in <el> insulin <le> and <el> insulin <le>-like growth factor-I (<re> IGF-I <er>) signaling pathways. Insulin stimulation increased Ras-GTP formation in Rat-1 fibroblasts overexpressing normal human <el> insulin <le> receptors (HIRc-B), far greater than in parental Rat-1 fibroblasts, indicating that competent <el> insulin <le> receptors mediate this response. Cellular microinjection of a dominant-negative mutant p21ras protein (N17 ras) or anti-p21ras monoclonal antibody (Y13-259) into HIRc-B cells reduced <el> insulin <le>- and <re> IGF-I <er>-stimulated DNA synthesis by 75-90%. Insulin-induced c-fos protein expression was also inhibited by 74%. Microinjection of oncogenic p21ras (T-24 ras) into HIRc-B cells activated the mitogenic pathway, and coinjection of N17 ras and T-24 ras showed that oncogenic p21ras rescued the cells from the N17 ras blockade. This later finding indicates that T-24 ras acts downstream of N17 ras. 
Extracellular environments can regulate cell behavior because cells can actively sense their mechanical environments. This study evaluated the <re> adhesion <er>, proliferation and morphology of endothelial cells on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/alumina (<el> Al2 <le> O3 ) composites and pure PDMS. The substrates were prepared from pure PDMS and its composites with 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 wt % <el> Al2 <le> O3 at a curing temperature of 50°C for 4 h. The substrates were then characterized by mechanical, structural, and morphological analyses. The cell <re> adhesion <er>, proliferation, and morphology of cultured bovine aortic endothelial (BAEC) cells on substrate materials were evaluated by using resazurin assay and 1,1'-dioctadecyl-1,3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate-acetylated LDL (Dil-Ac-LDL) cell staining, respectively. The composites (PDMS/2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 wt % <el> Al2 <le> O3 ) exhibited higher stiffness than the pure PDMS substrate. The results also revealed that stiffer substrates promoted endothelial cell <re> adhesion <er> and proliferation and also induced spread morphology in the endothelial cells compared with lesser stiff substrates. Statistical analysis showed that the effect of time on cell proliferation depended on stiffness. 
Aquaporin-1 (AQP1), a water channel protein, has been shown to play an important role in tumor growth and angiogenesis in mouse endothelial cells. We recently reported that the <re> expression of AQP1 <er> mRNA was induced in cultured human retinal vascular endothelial cells (HRVECs) under <el> hypoxia <le>. In the present study, HRVECs were cultured under normoxia or <el> hypoxia <le> (1% O(2)) to elucidate the mechanism of hypoxic induction of AQP1. AQP1 mRNA expression was increased 1.7 ± 0.24-fold under <el> hypoxia <le> compared with that under normoxia (p < 0.01). This increase was almost completely blocked by the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (p < 0.01). The degradation of AQP1 mRNA showed no difference under normoxia or <el> hypoxia <le>. These data suggest that the <el> hypoxia <le>-induced <re> expression of AQP1 <er> results from RNA transcription. The sequence located from -1338 to -1334 bp is identical to the consensus sequence of the <el> hypoxia <le>-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) binding site. The promoter activities of the two constructs including this putative HIF-1 binding site showed 2.0 ± 0.67-fold increase and 2.9 ± 1.9-fold increase under <el> hypoxia <le> when compared with those under normoxia. However, both deletion and mutation of the HIF-1 binding site abrogated this effect. These data suggest that this sequence mediates the transcriptional activation of AQP1 by <el> hypoxia <le>. The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that HIF-1α bound to the putative HIF-1 binding site. 
Studies of <el> calcium <le> kinetics require administration of <re> tracer <er> doses of <el> calcium <le> and subsequent repeated sampling of biological fluids. This study was designed to develop techniques that would allow estimation of <el> calcium <le> kinetics by using small (micrograms) doses of isotopes instead of the more common large (mg) doses to minimize <re> tracer <er> perturbation of the system and reduce cost, and to explore the use of saliva sampling as an alternative to blood sampling. Subjects received an oral dose (133 micrograms) of 43Ca and an i.v. dose (7.7 micrograms) of 46Ca. Isotopic enrichment in blood, urine, saliva and feces was well above thermal ionization mass spectrometry measurement precision up to 170 h after dosing. Fractional <el> calcium <le> absorptions determined from isotopic ratios in blood, urine and saliva were similar. Compartmental modeling revealed that kinetic parameters determined from serum or saliva data were similar, decreasing the necessity for blood samples. 
In order to investigate the role of the peripeduncular nucleus (<re> PP <er>) in the control of lordosis in female rats, activation of neurons after mounts without intromission was investigated by means of FOS immunoreactivity (FOS-IR). Ovariectomized rats were injected with estradiol and progesterone and submitted to approximately 50 mounts by the male. The vaginal area was covered with masking tape to prevent intromission and vaginocervical stimulation. This limited stimulation produced FOS-IR in the ventrolateral division of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMHVL), in the lateral periaqueductal grey (<el> LPAG <le>), in the peripeduncular nucleus (<re> PP <er>), and in the posterior intralaminar thalamic nucleus (PIL). No significant differences were found in the anterodorsal or posterodorsal parts of the medial amygdaloid nucleus, in the medial part of the medial preoptic nucleus, in the dorsomedial periaqueductal grey and in the medial division of the posterointermediate part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. The same experiment was performed in rats with unilateral lesion of the <re> PP <er>. 
During infection, <re> chemokine <er>s sequestered on endothelium induce recruitment of circulating leukocytes into the tissue where they chemotax along <re> chemokine <er> gradients toward the afflicted site. The aim of this in vivo study was to determine whether a <re> chemokine <er> gradient was formed intravascularly and influenced intraluminal neutrophil crawling and transmigration. A <re> chemokine <er> gradient was induced by placing a macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2)-containing (CXCL2) gel on the cremaster muscle of anesthetized wild-type mice or heparanase-overexpressing transgenic mice (hpa-tg) with truncated heparan sulfate (<el> HS <le>) side chains. Neutrophil-endothelial interactions were visualized by intravital microscopy and <re> chemokine <er> gradients detected by confocal microscopy. Localized extravascular <re> chemokine <er> release (MIP-2 gel) induced directed neutrophil crawling along a chemotactic gradient immobilized on the endothelium and accelerated their recruitment into the target tissue compared with homogeneous extravascular <re> chemokine <er> concentration (MIP-2 superfusion). Endothelial <re> chemokine <er> sequestration occurred exclusively in venules and was <el> HS <le>-dependent, and neutrophils in hpa-tg mice exhibited random crawling. Despite similar numbers of adherent neutrophils in hpa-tg and wild-type mice, the altered crawling in hpa-tg mice was translated into decreased number of emigrated neutrophils and ultimately decreased the ability to clear bacterial infections. 
Regulatory T (T reg) cells are the major obstacle to cancer immunotherapy, and their depletion promptly induces conversion of peripheral precursors into T reg cells. We show that T reg cells can be functionally inactivated by <el> OX40 <le> triggering. In tumors, the vast majority of CD4(+) T cells are Foxp3(+) and <el> OX40 <le>(bright). However, intratumor injection of the agonist anti-<el> OX40 <le> monoclonal antibody (mAb) OX86, but not anti-CD25 mAb, induces tumor rejection in 80% of mice, an effect that is abrogated by CD8 depletion. Upon intratumor <el> OX40 <le> triggering, increased numbers of infiltrating dendritic cells (<re> DCs <er>) migrate to draining lymph nodes and generate a new wave of tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, as detected by tetramer and CD44 staining of node CD8(+) T lymphocytes. Tumor-bearing Rag1-knockout (KO) mice reconstituted with <el> OX40 <le>-deficient T reg cells and wild-type (WT) effector T cells, or the reciprocal combination, showed that both T reg and effector T cells must be triggered via <el> OX40 <le> for the tumor to be rejected. Accordingly, WT but not <el> OX40 <le>-KO mice receiving intratumor coinjection of OX86 and ovalbumin protein were able to revert tumor-induced tolerization of adoptively transferred <el> OX40 <le>-competent OTII T lymphocytes. 
Plant sterol (<el> PS <le>) oxidation products (<re> POP <er>) derived from sitosterol and campesterol were measured in 15 foods cooked with liquid margarine without (control) and with added 7.5% <el> PS <le>. <re> POP <er> were analyzed using a GC-MS method. <el> PS <le> liquid vs. control margarine resulted in a higher median <re> POP <er> content per food portion (1.35mg, range 0.08-13.20mg versus 0.23mg, 0.06-0.90mg), a lower <el> PS <le> oxidation rate (0.63 vs. 1.29%) and lower oxidation susceptibility of sitosterol vs. campesterol. <re> POP <er> formation was highest in shallow-fried potatoes with <el> PS <le> liquid margarine (64.44mg per portion food plus residual fat). Mean relative abundances of epoxy-, 7-keto-, 7-hydroxy- and triol-<el> PS <le> derived from sitosterol and campesterol were 40.0, 34.4, 21.5 and 4.0% with control vs. 44.1, 23.8, 29.6 and 2.4% with <el> PS <le> liquid margarine. 
Activation of cytoskeleton regulator Rho-kinase during ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) plays a major role in I/R injury and <re> apoptosis <er>. Since Rho-kinase is a negative regulator of the pro-survival phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase)/Akt pathway, we hypothesized that inhibition of Rho-kinase can prevent I/R-induced endothelial cell <re> apoptosis <er> by maintaining PI3-kinase/Akt activity and that protective effects of Rho-kinase inhibition are facilitated by prevention of <el> F-actin <le> rearrangement. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were subjected to 1 h of simulated ischemia and 1 or 24 h of simulated reperfusion after treatment with Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632, PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, <el> F-actin <le> depolymerizers cytochalasinD and latrunculinA and <el> F-actin <le> stabilizer jasplakinolide. Intracellular ATP levels decreased following I/R. Y-27632 treatment reduced I/R-induced <re> apoptosis <er> by 31% (P < 0.01) and maintained Akt activity. Both effects were blocked by co-treatment with wortmannin. Y-27632 treatment prevented the formation of <el> F-actin <le> bundles during I/R. Similar results were observed with cytochalasinD treatment. In contrast, latrunculinA and jasplakinolide treatment did not prevent the formation of <el> F-actin <le> bundles during I/R and had no effect on I/R-induced <re> apoptosis <er>. Apoptosis and Akt activity were inversely correlated (R (2) = 0.68, P < 0.05). 
Tadalafil, an oral phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, is being investigated as a treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Bosentan is an oral endothelin receptor antagonist widely used in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Tadalafil is mainly metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, and as <el> bosentan <le> induces CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, a pharmacokinetic interaction is possible between these agents. This open-label, randomized study investigated whether any pharmacokinetic interaction exists between <re> tadalafil <er> and <el> bosentan <le>. Healthy adult men (n = 15; 19-52 years of age) received 10 consecutive days of <re> tadalafil <er> 40 mg once daily, <el> bosentan <le> 125 mg twice daily, and a combination of both in a 3-period, crossover design. Following 10 days of multiple-dose coadministration of <el> bosentan <le> and <re> tadalafil <er>, compared with <re> tadalafil <er> alone, <re> tadalafil <er> geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval [CI]) for AUCtau and Cmax were 0.59 (0.55, 0.62) and 0.73 (0.68, 0.79), respectively, with no observed change in tmax. Following coadministration of <el> bosentan <le> with <re> tadalafil <er>, <el> bosentan <le> ratios (90% CI) for AUCtau and Cmax were 1.13 (1.02, 1.24) and 1.20 (1.05, 1.36), respectively. Tadalafil alone and combined with <el> bosentan <le> was generally well tolerated. 
The effects of the <el> calcium <le> antagonists verapamil, gallopamil, nifedipine, felodipine and diltiazem on <re> noradrenaline <er> release during ischemia were studied in isolated perfused rat hearts. Endogenous levels of <re> noradrenaline <er> and its intraneuronal metabolite dihydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (DOPEG) were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography. Global isothermic ischemia of 20 min caused a release of endogenous <re> noradrenaline <er> amounting to 180 +/- 15 pmol/g. The <el> calcium <le> antagonists tested significantly suppressed ischemia-induced <re> noradrenaline <er> release (IC50 in mumols/l: verapamil 1, gallopamil 0.3, nifedipine 1, felodipine 3). Noradrenaline release during ischemia and the inhibitory effect of the <el> calcium <le> antagonists, were independent of extracellular <el> calcium <le>, indicating a nonexocytotic release mechanism. Interaction of the <el> calcium <le> antagonists with the major components of nonexocytotic release, intraneuronal storage and carrier-mediated transport, was tested in normoxic rat hearts. Vesicular storage was not stabilized by the <el> calcium <le> antagonists. In fact, verapamil, gallopamil, diltiazem and felodipine disturbed storage function, as indicated by an increased DOPEG release. Direct interaction with the <re> noradrenaline <er> carrier (uptake1) was demonstrated for verapamil, gallopamil, and diltiazem in a model of 3H-<re> noradrenaline <er> uptake. 
Activation of C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (<el> CCR7 <le>) has been demonstrated to mediate the occurrence and progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the potential therapeutic role of <el> CCR7 <le> inhibition in NSCLC is still obscure. Thus, the present study was conducted to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibition of <el> CCR7 <le> on cell apoptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in NSCLC A549 cells. Chemokine ligand 21 (CCL21) was used to activate <el> CCR7 <le> and the results revealed that <el> CCR7 <le> upregulation inhibited cell apoptosis and affected apoptosis‑related protein levels. However, <el> CCR7 <le>-siRNA treatment markedly promoted apoptosis and suppressed inflammatory response and transforming growth factor β1 (<re> TGF-β <er>1)-induced EMT. In addition, <el> CCR7 <le>‑siRNA inactivated the NF-κB signaling pathway and inhibition of NF-κB via its specific antagonist, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, indicated that NF-κB was involved in the <el> CCR7 <le>-mediated apoptosis. In conclusion, upregulation of <el> CCR7 <le> promoted cell proliferation and inflammation in A549 cells. 
Depolarized mitochondria are degraded by <re> mitophagy <er> in a process that depends on the Parkinson's disease gene products PINK1 and Parkin. This is accompanied by ubiquitylation of several mitochondrial substrates. The roles of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (UBE2) in <re> mitophagy <er> are poorly understood. Here, we investigate a set of UBE2 enzymes that might regulate Parkin-mediated <re> mitophagy <er>. Knockdown of the E2 enzymes UBE2N, UBE2L3 or UBE2D2 and UBE2D3 (<el> UBE2D2/3 <le>) significantly reduced autophagic clearance of depolarized mitochondria. However, this did not interfere with mitochondrial PINK1 stabilization and Parkin translocation. UBE2N knockdown prevented specifically K63-linked ubiquitylation at mitochondrial sites. Nevertheless, polyubiquitin and p62 (officially known as SQSTM1) were still found on mitochondria after individual UBE2 knockdown. Knockdown of all of these UBE2s together significantly reduced mitochondrial polyubiquitylation and p62 recruitment. Moreover, reduced ubiquitylation of mitofusins, the mitochondrial import receptor subunits TOM20 and TOM70, the voltage-dependent anion channel protein 1 and Parkin was observed in cells silenced for all of these UBE2s. A version of Parkin with a mutation in the active site (C431S) failed to ubiquitylate these mitochondrial substrates even in the presence of UBE2s. 
<el> Rac <le>, a small, GTP-binding protein in the Rho family, regulates several cellular functions, including the activation of NADPH oxidase, a major intracellular producer of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) isolated from mice that are genetically deficient in NADPH oxidase produce less ROS, and their activation during chronic liver injury is abrogated, resulting in decreased liver <re> fibrosis <er>. Therefore, we hypothesized that HSC ROS production and activation would be enhanced, and <re> fibrosis <er> worsened, by increasing <el> Rac <le> expression in HSCs. To achieve this, we used transgenic mice that express constitutively active human <el> Rac <le>1 under the control of the alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-sma) promoter, because alpha-sma expression is induced spontaneously during HSC activation. Transgene expression was upregulated progressively during culture of primary <el> Rac <le>-transgenic HSCs, and this increased HSC ROS production as well as expression of activation markers and collagen. Similarly, <el> Rac <le> mice treated with carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) accumulated greater numbers of activated HSCs and had more liver damage, hepatocyte apoptosis, and liver <re> fibrosis <er>-as well as higher mortality-than CCl(4)-treated wild-type mice. 
Peritoneal dissemination of <re> tumor <er> has high mortality and is associated with the loss of epithelial features, acquisition of motile mesenchymal morphology characteristics, and invasive properties by <re> tumor <er> cells. Melatonin is an endogenously produced molecule in all plant species that is known to exert antitumor activity, but to date, its underlying mechanisms and antiperitoneal metastasis efficacy is not well defined. This study determined the antiperitoneal dissemination potential of melatonin in vivo and assessed its association with the inhibition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling mechanism by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which may be a major molecular mechanism of melatonin against cancer. The results demonstrate that melatonin inhibited peritoneal metastasis in vivo and activated ER stress in Cignal ERSE Reporter Assay, organelle structure in transmission electron microscopy images, calpain activity, and protein biomarkers like p-elf2α. Moreover, the overexpression of transcription factor C/EBPβ in gastric cancer interacted with <el> NF <le>κB and further regulates COX-2 expression. These were dissociated and downregulated by melatonin, as proven by immunofluorescence imaging, immunoprecipitation, EMSA, and ChIP assay. Melatonin or gene silencing of C/EBPβ decreased the EMT protein markers (E-cadherin, Snail, and Slug) and Wnt/beta-catenin activity by Topflash activity, and increased ER stress markers. In an animal study, the results of melatonin therapy were consistent with those of in vitro findings and attenuated systemic proangiogenesis factor production. 
The cerebral innate immune system is able to modulate brain functioning and cognitive processes. During activation of the cerebral innate immune system, inflammatory factors produced by microglia, such as cytokines and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), have been directly linked to modulation of glutamatergic system on one hand and learning and memory functions on the other hand. However, the cellular mechanisms by which microglial activation modulates cognitive processes are still unclear. Here, we used <re> taste <er> memory tasks, highly dependent on glutamatergic transmission in the insular cortex, to investigate the behavioral and cellular impacts of an <el> inflammation <le> restricted to this cortical area in rats. We first show that intrainsular infusion of the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide induces a local <el> inflammation <le> and increases glutamatergic AMPA, but not NMDA, receptor expression at the synaptic level. This cortical <el> inflammation <le> also enhances associative, but not incidental, <re> taste <er> memory through increase of glutamatergic AMPA receptor trafficking. Moreover, we demonstrate that ATP, but not proinflammatory cytokines, is responsible for <el> inflammation <le>-induced enhancement of both associative <re> taste <er> memory and AMPA receptor expression in insular cortex. 
The cerebral effects of adding <el> theophylline <le> to 1.4% <re> isoflurane <er> anaesthesia were studied in five dogs by a sagittal sinus outflow technique with direct measurement of the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and calculation of the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRo2). Three 3 mg.kg-1 doses of <el> theophylline <le> were given with intervals of 10 min. Five min after the second and third dose, when the mean <el> theophylline <le> plasma concentration was 41 and 65 mumols.1(-1), respectively, CMRo2 had increased significantly with a mean value varying between 15% and 13%, and the EEG had changed from a sleep pattern to a more awake pattern in the four dogs with evaluable recordings. There were no significant changes in CBF or mean arterial blood pressure (MABP). 
The interaction between oestrogen and <el> progesterone <le> in the regulation of the uterine <re> oxytocin receptor <er> in sheep was evaluated by measuring the binding of oxytocin to membrane preparations of caruncular and intercaruncular endometrium and myometrium. Ovariectomized ewes were assigned in groups of five to each cell of a 4 x 2 factorial design. The four treatments were (a) vehicle (maize oil) for 12 days, (b) <el> progesterone <le> (10 mg day-1) for 9 days, (c) <el> progesterone <le> for 9 days followed by maize oil until day 12 and (d) <el> progesterone <le> for 12 days. The two oestradiol treatments consisted of the administration of implants in the presence or absence of oestradiol. The ewes were killed on day 10 (group b) or day 13 (groups a, c and d) for collection of uterine tissues. The response of the caruncular and intercaruncular endometrium to the treatments was similar. In the absence of oestradiol, treatment with <el> progesterone <le> continuously for either 9 or 12 days reduced the concentration of the <re> oxytocin receptor <er> in comparison with both the control and the <el> progesterone <le> withdrawal group (in which values were similar). The presence of oestradiol reduced the receptor concentrations in control and both 9- and 12-day continuous <el> progesterone <le> treatment groups, but enhanced the concentration in the <el> progesterone <le> withdrawal group. The myometrial <re> oxytocin receptor <er>s responded in a similar way to those in the endometrium to <el> progesterone <le> treatment alone, but the addition of oestradiol produced no further effect. 
Exposure to ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation induces inflammation and photocarcinogenesis in mammalian skin. Docosahexaenoic acid (<el> DHA <le>), a representative ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive properties. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of <el> DHA <le> on UVB-induced inflammation in mouse skin. Our study revealed that topical application of <el> DHA <le> prior to UVB irradiation attenuated the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and NAD(P)H:oxidase-4 (NOX-4) in hairless mouse skin. <el> DHA <le> pretreatment also attenuated UVB-induced DNA binding of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) through the inhibition of phosphorylation of IκB kinase-α/β, phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα and nuclear translocation of p50 and p65. In addition, UVB-induced phosphorylation of p65 at the serine 276 residue was significantly inhibited by topical application of <el> DHA <le>. Irradiation with UVB induced phosphorylation of mitogen and stress-activated kinase-1 (MSK1), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and all these events were attenuated by pretreatment with <el> DHA <le>. Blocking ERK and p38 MAP kinase signaling by U0126 and SB203580, respectively, diminished MSK1 phosphorylation in UVB-irradiated mouse skin. Pretreatment with H-89, a pharmacological inhibitor of MSK1, abrogated UVB-induced activation of NF-κB and the <re> expression of COX-2 <er> and NOX-4 in mouse skin. 
Leptin is an adipocyte-derived cytokine secreted mostly by adipose tissue. Serum <el> leptin <le> levels are elevated in obese individuals and correlate positively with body mass index (BMI). Interestingly, serum <el> leptin <le> levels are also elevated in patients with <re> psoriasis <er> and correlate positively with disease severity. Psoriasis is associated with obesity; patients with <re> psoriasis <er> have a higher incidence of obesity, and obese individuals have a higher risk of developing <re> psoriasis <er>. Additionally, obese patients with <re> psoriasis <er> experience a more severe degree of <re> psoriasis <er>. In this study, we hypothesised that <el> leptin <le> may link <re> psoriasis <er> and obesity and plays an aggravating role in <re> psoriasis <er>. To investigate <el> leptin <le>'s role in <re> psoriasis <er>, we applied the widely accepted imiquimod (IMQ)-induced <re> psoriasis <er>-like skin inflammation mouse model on <el> leptin <le>-deficient (ob/ob) mice and evaluated <re> psoriasis <er> severity. Moreover, we stimulated human keratinocytes with <el> leptin <le> and investigated the effect on proliferation and expression of pro-inflammatory proteins. In ob/ob mice, clinical signs of erythema, infiltration and scales in dorsal skin and inflammation in ear skin, as measured by ear thickness, were attenuated and compared with wt mice. Moreover, IL-17A and IL-22 mRNA expression levels, as well as increased epidermal thickness, were significantly less induced. In vitro, the effect of <el> leptin <le> stimulation on human keratinocytes demonstrated increased proliferation and induced secretion of several pro-inflammatory proteins; two hallmarks of <re> psoriasis <er>. 
Angiotensin II (Ang II) is implicated in the proinflammatory process in various disease situations. Thus, we sought to determine the role of Ang II in early inflammation-induced <re> fibrosis <er> of pressure-overloaded (PO) hearts. PO was induced by suprarenal aortic constriction (AC) at day 0 in male Wistar rats, and they were orally administered 0.1 mg/kg per day <el> candesartan <le> every day from day -7. This was the maximum dose of <el> candesartan <le> that did not change arterial pressure in hypertensive rats with AC (AC rats). In AC rats, cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was transiently enhanced after day 1 and peaked at day 3, declining to lower levels by day 14, whereas serum ACE activity was not changed. In AC rats, PO induced early fibroinflammatory changes (monocyte chemoattractant factor [MCP]-1 and transforming growth factor [TGF]-beta expression, perivascular macrophage accumulation, and fibroblast proliferation), and thereafter, left ventricular hypertrophy developed, featuring myocyte hypertrophy, intramyocardial arterial wall thickening, and perivascular and interstitial fibroses. Candesartan suppressed the induction of MCP-1 and TGF-beta and reduced macrophage accumulation and fibroblast proliferation in PO hearts. Candesartan significantly prevented perivascular and interstitial <re> fibrosis <er>. However, <el> candesartan <le> did not affect myocyte hypertrophy and arterial wall thickening. 
Interferon-gamma (<el> IFN-gamma <le>) is known to exert deleterious effects on pancreatic beta-cells and is implicated in the development of type 1 (autoimmune) diabetes mellitus. In this study, we investigated signaling mechanisms mediating the effects of <el> IFN-gamma <le> in pancreatic beta-cells using a differentiated rat insulin-secreting cell line, <re> INS-1 <er>, with special reference to the activation of transcription factors STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription)1 and NF-kappaB. Exposure of <re> INS-1 <er> cells to 100 IU/ml <el> IFN-gamma <le> for 24 h resulted in significant inhibition of nutrient-induced insulin secretion associated with impaired metabolism. In combination with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (50 ng/ml), <el> IFN-gamma <le> elicited severe cytotoxicity and induced the expression of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA. <el> IFN-gamma <le> promoted tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA-binding of STAT1 through Janus kinase (JAK)1 activation without apparent phosphorylation of JAK2. TNF-alpha did not affect STAT1 activation, but stimulated DNA-binding and transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB, both of which were further increased by <el> IFN-gamma <le>. These effects of <el> IFN-gamma <le> and TNF-alpha seem physiologically relevant, because either inhibition of STAT1 by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A or that of NF-kappaB by sulfasalazine resulted in the reduction of iNOS mRNA expression. 
The level of acetyl-coenzyme-A carboxylase activity in Candida lipolytica undergoes large variations depending upon the carbon source on which the yeast is grown. Cells grown on n-alkanes or fatty acids exhibit a lower activity level than do cells grown on glucose. Among the n-alkanes and fatty acids tested, n-heptadecane, n-octadecane, oleic acid and linoleic acid reduce the enzyme activity to the lowest levels, which are 16-18% of the activity level in glucose-grown cells. Immunochemical titrations and Ouchterlony double-diffusion analysis with specific antibody as well as kinetic studies have indicated that the observed decrease in the level of <el> acetyl-CoA carboxylase <le> activity is due to a reduction in the cellular content of the enzyme. Furthermore, isotopic leucine incorporation studies with the use of the immunoprecipitation technique have demonstrated that the relative rate of <re> synthesis <er> of the enzyme in oleic-acid-grown cells is diminished to 12% of that in glucose-grown cells. Evidence has also been obtained to support the view that the enzyme in this yeast is not degraded at a rate high enough to contribute to the marked decrease in the cellular content of the enzyme. 
The electrically excitable salivary cells of the giant Amazon leech, Haementeria, display a time-dependent inward rectification. Under voltage clamp, hyperpolarizing steps to membrane potentials negative to about -70 mV were associated with the activation of a slow inward current (<re> Ih <er>) which showed no inactivation with time. The time course of activation of <re> Ih <er> was described by a single-exponential function and was strongly voltage dependent. The activation curve of <re> Ih <er> ranged from -72 to -118 mV, with half-activation occurring at -100 mV. Ion-substitution experiments indicated that <re> Ih <er> is carried by both Na+ and K+ ions. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (<el> 5-HT <le>) increased the amplitude of <re> Ih <er> and its rate of activation. It also produced a positive shift of the activation curve of the conductance underlying <re> Ih <er> (Gh) without altering the slope factor, thus indicating that the voltage dependence of <re> Ih <er> was modulated by <el> 5-HT <le>. Cs+ blocked both <re> Ih <er> and the <el> 5-HT <le>-potentiated current in a voltage-independent manner, whereas Ba2+ had little effect. 
This study was performed to investigate the immediate actions of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 on the permeability of the glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) in rats and to test whether these actions are dependent upon the release of reactive oxygen species (<re> ROS <er>). In anesthetized rats, blood access was achieved and the left ureter was cannulated for urine collection. Rats were continuously infused intravenously with either IL-1β (0.4 and 2 μg·kg(-1)·h(-1)), TNF-α (0.4 and 2 μg·kg(-1)·h(-1)), or IL-6 (4 and 8 μg·kg(-1)·h(-1)), together with polydisperse FITC-Ficoll-70/400 and inulin for 1 h. Plasma and urine samples were analyzed by high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) for determination of glomerular sieving coefficients (θ). The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was also assessed (51Cr-EDTA). In separate experiments, the <el> superoxide <le> scavenger tempol (30 mg·kg(-1)·h(-1)) was given before and during cytokine infusions. IL-1β and TNF-α caused rapid, partly reversible increases in glomerular permeability to large molecules (Ficoll50-80Å), peaking at 5-30 min, while IL-6 caused a more gradual increase in permeability, leveling off at 60 min. Tempol almost completely abrogated the glomerular permeability effects of the cytokines infused. 
Mesangial matrix expansion is an early lesion leading to glomeruloclerosis and chronic renal diseases. A beneficial effect is achieved with angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), which also favor bradykinin (BK) B2 receptor (<el> B2R <le>) activation. To define the underlying mechanism, we hypothesized that <el> B2R <le> activation could be a negative regulator of collagen synthesis in mesangial cells (<re> MC <er>). We investigated the effect of BK on collagen synthesis and signaling in <re> MC <er>. Inflammation was evaluated by intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression. BK inhibited collagen I and IV synthesis stimulated by high glucose, epithelial growth factor (EGF), and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) but did not alter ICAM-1. Inhibition of collagen synthesis was <el> B2R <le> but not B1R mediated. PKC or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors mimicked the BK effect. <el> B2R <le> activation inhibited TGF-β- and EGF-induced Erk1/2, Smad2/3, Akt S473, and EGFR phosphorylation. A phosphatase inhibitor prevented BK effects. The in vivo impact of <el> B2R <le> on mesangial matrix expansion was assessed in streptozotocin-diabetic rodents. Deletion of <el> B2R <le> increased mesangial matrix expansion and albuminuria in diabetic mice. In diabetic rats, matrix expansion and albuminuria were prevented by ACEI but not by ACEI and <el> B2R <le> antagonist cotreatment. Consistently, the lowered BK content of diabetic glomeruli was restored by ACEI. 
Diabetes mellitus is associated with endothelial dysfunction that is believed to result in impaired release of vasoconstrictor and vasodilator substances from the endothelium and thereby diminished reactivity of many vascular beds. This study was designed to characterize bradykinin (<el> BK <le>)-induced coronary <re> vasodilation <er> in normal and diabetic rats. Bradykinin-stimulated <re> vasodilation <er> of the rat coronary vasculature is mediated by a cytochrome P450-1A (CYP-1A)- inhibitable metabolite that activates KCa, but not KATP, channels on the coronary vascular smooth muscle. Although <el> BK <le> stimulates the release of nitric oxide from the vascular endothelium, the released nitric oxide and its ability to stimulate guanylate cyclase only modulates the duration of, rather than the magnitude of, <el> BK <le>-induced coronary <re> vasodilation <er>. Twelve weeks of streptozotocin-induced diabetes did not affect the coronary vascular responses to <el> BK <le> or the components that mediate <el> BK <le>-induced <re> vasodilation <er> (ie, K-channel activation, nitric oxide-guanylate cyclase). 
The effect of <el> EGF <le> on (14)C-alpha-methyl-D-glucopyranoside (<re> alpha-MG <er>) uptake and its related signaling pathways were examined in primary cultured rabbit renal proximal tubule cells (PTCs). Epidermal growth factor (<el> EGF <le>) (50 ng/ml) was found to inhibit <re> alpha-MG <er> uptake, a distinctive proximal tubule marker. The <el> EGF <le> effect was blocked by AG1478 (an <el> EGF <le> receptor antagonist) or genistein and herbimycin (tyrosine kinase inhibitors), respectively. In addition, the <el> EGF <le>-induced inhibition of <re> alpha-MG <er> uptake was blocked by neomycin and U73122 (phospholipase C inhibitors) as well as staurosporine, H-7, and bisindolylmaleimide I (protein kinase C inhibitors). <el> EGF <le> was also observed to increase inositol phosphate formation. Furthermore, both the <el> EGF <le>-induced inhibition of <re> alpha-MG <er> uptake and increase of arachidonic acid (AA) release were blocked by AACOCF(3) (a cytosolic phospholipase A(2) inhibitor), indomethacin (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor), and econazole (a cytochrome P-450 epoxygenase inhibitor). We examined the involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in mediating the effect of <el> EGF <le> on <re> alpha-MG <er> uptake. Indeed, <el> EGF <le> increased phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAPK and the <el> EGF <le>-induced inhibition of <re> alpha-MG <er> uptake as well as the stimulatory effect of <el> EGF <le> on AA release was blocked by PD 98059 (a p44/42 MAPK inhibitor), suggesting a causal relationship. However, inhibitors of PKC also prevented the <el> EGF <le>-induced increase of AA release. 
To determine whether any interaction occurs between <el> progesterone <le> and 17 beta-estradiol in the regulation of FFA metabolism by the liver, normal female rats were injected sc daily for 14 days with 7.5, 15, 50, or 100 microgram 17 beta-estradiol/kg, 25 mg <el> progesterone <le>/kg, 15 microgram 17 beta-estradiol plus 25 mg <el> progesterone <le>/kg, or vehicle (sesame oil) alone. To determine the effects of these hormones in the absence of endogenous estradiol and <el> progesterone <le>, ovariectomized rats were treated with the steroids. Livers were removed from the variously treated rats and perfused in vitro in a recycling system. An albumin-oleate complex was infused into the perfusate, providing a steady state concentration of 0.3--0.5 nM oleate. The uptake of FFA and output of ketone bodies and glucose by the livers were generally not altered by any of the steroid treatments. Neither these parameters nor <re> triglyceride secretion <er> was altered by ovariectomy. The administration of 15, 50, and 100 microgram estradiol/kg to normal, but not ovariectomized rats, increased <re> triglyceride secretion <er>. Progesterone alone had no effect on the secretion of triglyceride, but did antagonize the estradiol-mediated stimulation of <re> triglyceride secretion <er> in normal rats. The molar ratios of phospholipid to triglyceride and cholesterol to triglyceride of the very low density lipoprotein secreted by livers from normal females treated with estradiol were not altered, suggesting that the livers secreted more very low density lipoprotein particles of the same size. Based on the same criteria, livers from ovariectomized rats secreted smaller very low density lipoprotein particles compared to livers from control animals, an effect which was reversed by the administration of estradiol. 
Sessile organisms may experience chronic exposure to <el> copper <le> that is released into the marine environment from antifoulants and stormwater runoff. We have identified the site of damage caused by <el> copper <le> to the symbiotic cnidarian, Zoanthus robustus (Anthozoa, Hexacorallia). External changes to the zoanthids were apparent when compared with controls. The normally flexible bodies contracted and became rigid. Histological examination of the zoanthid tissue revealed that <el> copper <le> had caused sub-cellular changes to proteins within the extracellular matrix (<re> ECM <er>) of the tubular body. Collagen in the <re> ECM <er> and the internal septa increased in thickness to five and seven times that of controls respectively. The epithelium, which stained for elastin, was also twice as thick and tough to cut, but exposure to <el> copper <le> did not change the total amount of desmosine which is found only in elastin. 
Studies demonstrating the antagonism by prostaglandins (PGs) of antidiuretic hormone (<el> ADH <le>) action led to the proposal that renal medullary PGs may act to attenuate the physiologic effects of <el> ADH <le> via a negative-feedback loop. Therefore, we examined urinary PG excretion, an indicator of renal PG synthesis, in rats with hereditary diabetes insipidus (DI) utilizing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The DI rats, devoid of <el> ADH <le>, excrete much less prostaglandin E2 (<re> PGE2 <er>) than normal Long-Evans rats (39 +/- 5 vs. 228 +/- 53 ng/24 h, means +/- SE, P less than 0.005). DI and normal rats were treated for 35 days with <el> ADH <le> while separate groups of DI and normal controls received vehicle only. The <el> ADH <le> treatment increased urinary <re> PGE2 <er> excretion in DI rats to 233 +/- 35 ng/24 h whereas <re> PGE2 <er> excretion was unaffected by vehicle treatment. <el> ADH <le> treatment in normal rats similarly increased <re> PGE2 <er> excretion from 215 +/- 49 to 410 +/- 63 ng/24 h (P less than 0.05). To determine whether the rise in <re> PGE2 <er> excretion is the result of the rise in papillary osmolality, we subjected DI rats to dehydration, which increased urine osmolality from 130 +/- 10 to 302 +/- 12 mosmol/kg H2O but left urinary <re> PGE2 <er> unaffected. 
The neurotransmitters and receptor types involved in the afferent arm of the human pupillary light reflex are unknown. We hypothesized that the pupillary light reflex is mediated in part by <re> NMDA <er> receptors and that it would be depressed by the <re> NMDA <er> antagonists, nitrous oxide and <el> ketamine <le>. To study this question, sixteen patients received general anesthesia with desflurane, fentanyl, and muscular relaxation with rocuronium. After a stable level of general anesthesia had been obtained and at least 1h after the start of the surgical procedure, <el> ketamine <le> 1mg/kg (N=8) or saline (N=8) was injected intravenously by random selection. Heart rate, pupil size, pupillary light reflex, BIS scores, and blood pressure were measured every 2min before and for 30min after drug administration. A similar study of sixteen patients was then conducted with either addition of 60% nitrous oxide or 60% nitrogen to the gas mixture. We observed that the pupillary light reflex was depressed by <el> ketamine <le> and nitrous oxide by approximately 50%. The BIS score, representing the processed electroencephalogram, was elevated by <el> ketamine <le> and unchanged with nitrous oxide. Heart rate, pupil size, and blood pressure were unchanged by the drugs when compared to the control groups. 
In this three-stage study, we test the hypothesis that supplementary cleaning with <el> potassium <le> permanganate > or =4 mg.l(-1) eliminates protein and particle contamination from the reusable Classic laryngeal <re> mask <er> airway. The first stage involved supplementary cleaning of 70 1 x 1 cm segments from deliberately contaminated laryngeal <re> mask <er> airways using <el> potassium <le> permanganate at 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 mg.l(-1) and testing for protein staining. This showed that the lowest concentration required to eliminate protein contamination was 8 mg.l(-1). The second stage involved supplementary cleaning of 50 used laryngeal <re> mask <er> airways with either <el> potassium <le> permanganate 8 mg.l(-1) or saline and testing for protein staining. This showed that protein contamination was lower in the <el> potassium <le> permanganate group (p < 0.00001): all laryngeal <re> mask <er> airways in the control group and none in the <el> potassium <le> permanganate group were contaminated. The third stage involved scanning electron microscopic examination of 1 x 1 cm segments from three laryngeal <re> mask <er> airways used in the control group, three from the <el> potassium <le> permanganate group, plus three brand new laryngeal <re> mask <er> airways. The mean density of > or =1 mum surface particles was lower in the <el> potassium <le> permanganate 8 mg.l(-1) than the control group (21 vs. 121 .cm(-2), p < 0.0001) and was similar to brand new laryngeal <re> mask <er> airways (24 .cm(-2)). 
Morolic (1) and moronic (2) acids are the main constituents of acetonic extract from Phoradendron reichenbachianum (Loranthaceae), a medicinal plant used in Mexico for the treatment of diabetes. The aim of the current study was to establish the sub-acute antidiabetic and antihyperlipidemic effects of compounds 1 and 2 over non <el> insulin <le>-dependent diabetic rat model. Also, to determine the antihyperglycemic action on normoglycemic rats by oral glucose tolerance test. Daily-administered morolic (1) and moronic (2) acids (50 mg/kg) significantly lowered the blood glucose levels at 60% since first day until tenth day after treatment than untreated group (p<0.05). Moreover, analyzed blood samples obtained from diabetic rats indicated that both compounds diminished plasmatic concentration of <re> cholesterol <er> (CHO) and triglycerides (TG), returning them to normal levels (p<0.05). Also, pretreatment with 50 mg/kg of each compound induced significant antihyperglycemic effect after glucose and sucrose loading (2 g/kg) compared with control group (p<0.05). In vitro studies showed that compounds 1 and 2 induced inhibition of 11β-HSD 1 activity at 10 μM. However, in silico analysis of the pentaclyclic triterpenic acids on 11β-HSD 1 revealed that all compounds had high docking scores and important interactions with the catalytic site allowing them to inhibit 11β-HSD 1 enzyme. 
Chemical cauterization of the central cornea with <el> silver nitrate <le> was assessed as a superficial injury model of tissue sensitization accompanying acute <re> inflammation <er>. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with halothane gas, and the centers of their right corneas treated with a <el> silver nitrate <le> applicator stick (75% <el> silver nitrate <le>, 25% potassium nitrate) to produce a discrete lesion 1 mm in diameter. Edema of the corneal stroma and elevated immune cell counts became significant 4 h after cauterization, and were still evident after 48 h. Behavioral sensitization to chemical stimuli was determined by counting the number of blinks following application of 1 microM capsaicin directly to the corneal surface. A significant increase in stimulus-induced blinking was evident 2 h after cauterization. 
Diclofenac (DCL), an anti-inflammatory drug used to reduce pain and inflammation, ranks in the top causes of drug-induced liver injury. The inflammatory stress induced by inflammagens is implicated in DCL-induced liver injury. Curcumin (CUR) and selenium (<el> Se <le>) possess anti-inflammatory effects; therefore, this study evaluated their protective potential against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/DCL-induced liver injury. Rats received CUR and/or <el> Se <le> for 7 days followed by a single intravenous administration of LPS 2 h before a single injection of DCL and two other doses of CUR and/or <el> Se <le> 2 and 8 h after DCL. Administration of nontoxic doses of LPS and DCL resulted in liver damage evidenced by the significantly elevated liver function markers in serum. LPS/DCL-induced liver injury was confirmed by histological alterations, increased lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide, and diminished glutathione and superoxide dismutase. CUR and/or <el> Se <le> prevented liver injury, histological alterations, and oxidative stress and boosted antioxidant defenses in LPS/DCL-induced rats. In addition, CUR and/or <el> Se <le> reduced serum C-reactive protein, liver pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the expression of <re> TLR4 <er>, NF-κB, JNK, and p38, and upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). 
Prolonged stimulation of FRTL-5 thyroid cells with cAMP-generating agents including thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or cAMP analogues potentiates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2 triggered by insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, leading to enhancement of IGF-I-dependent proliferation. Because we identified <el> HSP90 <le> as an IRS-2-interacting protein, the roles of <el> HSP90 <le> in potentiation of IGF signals through IRS-2 were investigated. We found that prolonged dibutyryl cAMP treatment induced serine/threonine <re> phosphorylation of IRS-2 <er>. Using a specific inhibitor of <el> HSP90 <le> chaperone activity, geldanamycin, or small interfering RNA against <el> HSP90 <le>, we showed that <el> HSP90 <le> mediates cAMP-induced serine/threonine <re> phosphorylation of IRS-2 <er>. Furthermore, inhibition of <el> HSP90 <le> by geldanamycin during dibutyryl cAMP pretreatment of cells for 24h suppressed cAMP-dependent potentiation of tyrosine <re> phosphorylation of IRS-2 <er> induced by IGF-I. 
alpha-latrotoxin (LTX), a 120 kDa protein in black widow spider venom, triggers massive neurotransmitter <re> exocytosis <er>. Previous studies have highlighted a role for both intrinsic pore-forming activity and receptor binding in the action of this toxin. Intriguingly, activation of a presynaptic G protein-coupled receptor, <el> latrophilin <le>, may trigger release independent of pore-formation. Here we have utilized a previously identified ligand of nematode <el> latrophilin <le>, emodepside, to define a <el> latrophilin <le>-dependent pathway for neurotransmitter release in C. elegans. In the pharyngeal nervous system of this animal, emodepside (100 nM) stimulates <re> exocytosis <er> and elicits pharyngeal paralysis. The pharynxes of animals with <el> latrophilin <le> (lat-1) gene knockouts are resistant to emodepside, indicating that emodepside exerts its high-affinity paralytic effect through LAT-1. The expression pattern of lat-1 supports the hypothesis that emodepside exerts its effect on the pharynx primarily via neuronal <el> latrophilin <le>. We build on these observations to show that pharynxes from animals with either reduction or loss of function mutations in Gq, phospholipaseC-beta, and UNC-13 are resistant to emodepside. The latter is a key priming molecule essential for synaptic vesicle-mediated release of neurotransmitter. 
Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) participates in diverse fibrotic processes including glomerulosclerosis. The adenylyl cyclase agonist <el> forskolin <le> inhibits CTGF expression in mesangial cells by unclear mechanisms. We recently reported that the histone H3K79 methyltransferase disruptor of telomeric silencing-1 (Dot1) suppresses CTGF gene expression in collecting duct cells (J Clin Invest 117: 773-783, 2007) and HEK 293 cells (J Biol Chem In press). In the present study, we characterized the involvement of Dot1 in mediating the inhibitory effect of <el> forskolin <le> on <re> CTGF transcription <er> in mouse mesangial cells. Overexpression of Dot1 or treatment with <el> forskolin <le> dramatically suppressed basal CTGF mRNA levels and CTGF promoter-luciferase activity, while hypermethylating H3K79 in chromatin associated with the CTGF promoter. siRNA knockdown of Dot1 abrogated the inhibitory effect of <el> forskolin <le> on CTGF mRNA expression. Analysis of the Dot1 promoter sequence identified a CREB response element (CRE) at -384/-380. Overexpression of CREB enhanced <el> forskolin <le>-stimulated Dot1 promoter activity. A constitutively active CREB mutant (CREB-VP16) strongly induced Dot1 promoter-luciferase activity, whereas overexpression of CREBdLZ-VP16, which lacks the CREB DNA-binding domain, abolished this activation. Mutation of the -384/-380 CRE resulted in 70% lower levels of Dot1 promoter activity. ChIP assays confirmed CREB binding to the Dot1 promoter in chromatin. 
Previous studies have demonstrated a protective effect of the Ang-(1-7)/<el> Mas <le> receptor axis on pathological cardiac <re> hypertrophy <er>. Also, the involvement of <el> Mas <le> receptor in the exercise-induced cardiac <re> hypertrophy <er> has been suggested. However, the role of the Ang-(1-7)/<el> Mas <le> receptor on pregnancy-induced cardiac remodeling remains unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate the participation of the <el> Mas <le> receptor in the development of the cardiac <re> hypertrophy <er> and fibrosis induced by gestation. Female Wistar rats were shared in 3 groups: control , pregnant , and pregnant treated with <el> Mas <le> receptor antagonist A-779 . Wild type (WT) and <el> Mas <le>-knockout mice (KO) were distributed in non-pregnant  and pregnant  groups. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured by tail-cuff plethysmography. The medial part of the left ventricle (LV) was collected for histological analysis. Echocardiographic analysis was used to evaluate the cardiac function. SBP was not changed by pregnancy or A-779 treatment in the Wistar rats. Pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion of <el> Mas <le> receptor attenuates the pregnancy-induced myocyte <re> hypertrophy <er>. The treatment with A-779 or genetic deletion of the <el> Mas <le> receptor increased the collagen III deposition in LV from pregnant animals without changing the fibroblast proliferation. KO mice presented a lower ejection fraction, fraction shortening, stroke volume and higher end systolic volume compared to WT. Interestingly, the pregnancy restored these parameters. 
Regulation of the hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1, a member of the ETS family, plays a critical role in the development of blood cells and in leukemia. The dosage of PU.1 has been shown to cause a shift in myelomonocytic progenitor fate. Pin1 is a unique substrate-specific enzyme that can isomerize phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro peptide bonds, accelerating the conformational change in its substrates between a cis and a trans form. Such activity has been demonstrated to be a tightly controlled mechanism regulating a wide variety of protein functions under both normal physiological and pathological conditions. We have previously reported that a conformational change in Runx2 induced by Pin1 is essential for its function in osteogenesis in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we show that the Pin1-mediated conformational change in <el> Runx1 <le> enhances its acetylation and stabilization and, consequently, enhances its transacting activity. The increased acetylation of <el> Runx1 <le> represses <re> PU.1 transcription <er> in pre-monocytes. Conversely, the lack of (or the inhibition of) Pin1 increases <re> PU.1 transcription <er> in vitro and in vivo in pre-monocytes and in the spleen tissue. Pin1 KO mice have an increased CD11b(+) /F4/80(+) cell population and F4/80 protein expression in spleen. 
1. Bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity increases in hypoxic and acidotic conditions. We have analysed the effects of R(+)bupivacaine on <re> hKv1.5 <er> channels stably expressed in Ltk(-) cells using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique, at three different extracellular <el> pH <le> (<el> pH <le>(o)), 6.5, 7.4 and 10.0. 2. Acidification of the <el> pH <le>(o) from 7.4 to 6.5 decreased 4 fold the potency of R(+)bupivacaine to block <re> hKv1.5 <er> channels. At <el> pH <le>(o) 10.0, the potency of the drug increased approximately 2.5 fold. 3. Block induced by R(+)bupivacaine at <el> pH <le>(o) 6.5, 7.4 and 10.0, was voltage- and time-dependent in a manner consistent with an open state block of <re> hKv1.5 <er> channels. 4. At <el> pH <le>(o) 6.5, but not at <el> pH <le>(o) 7.4 or 10.0, R(+)bupivacaine increased by 95+/-3 % (n=6; P<0.05) the <re> hKv1.5 <er> current recorded at -10 mV, likely due to a drug-induced shift of the midpoint of activation (DeltaV=-8.5+/-1.4 mV; n=7). 5. R(+)bupivacaine development of block exhibited an 'instantaneous' component of block at the beginning of the depolarizing pulse, which averaged 12.5+/-1.8% (n=5) and 4.6+/-1.6% (n=6), at <el> pH <le>(o) 6.5 and 7.4, respectively, and that was not observed at <el> pH <le>(o) 10.0. 6. 
Disintegrins are Arg-Gly-Asp-containing proteins that inhibit <el> integrin <le>-mediated cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. We have purified a disintegrin, contortrostatin, from Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix snake venom that is a potent inhibitor of human metastatic melanoma (M24 met) <re> cell adhesion <er> to extracellular matrix proteins. Contortrostatin inhibits M24 met <re> cell adhesion <er> to type I collagen, vitronectin, and fibronectin with 50% inhibitory concentration values of 20, 75, and 220 nM, respectively. Contortrostatin does not significantly inhibit adhesion of M24 met cells to laminin. 125I-labeled contortrostatin binds to M24 met cells in a saturable and displaceable manner. Scatchard analysis indicates that there are two binding sites for 125I-labeled contortrostatin on the surface of these cells. High affinity binding has a Kd of 3 nM with 165,000 sites/cells low affinity binding has a Kd of 60 nM with 500,000 sites/cell. Immobilized contortrostatin can support adhesion of M24 met cells; this binding is blocked by a monoclonal antibody to the beta 1 <el> integrin <le> subunit and by an antibody to the fibronectin receptor alpha 5 beta 1. The anti-vitronectin receptor (alpha v beta 5) monoclonal antibody which blocks adhesion of M24 met cells to immobilized vitronectin does not block binding of M24 met cells to immobilized contortrostatin. In an in vivo experimental metastasis model system, contortrostatin at 20 micrograms and 100 micrograms inhibits lung colonization of M24 met cells (5 x 10(5)), injected in the tail vein of scid mice, by 51 and 73%, respectively. 
Envenomations by the snake Bothrops asper are characterized by prominent local tissue damage (i.e. myonecrosis), blistering, hemorrhage and edema. Various phospholipases A2 and metalloproteinases that induce local pathological alterations have been purified from this venom. Since these toxins induce a conspicuous <re> inflammatory response <er>, it has been hypothesized that inflammatory mediators may contribute to the local pathological alterations described. This study evaluated the local production of cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) as a consequence of intramuscular injections of an Asp-49 myotoxic phospholipase A2 (myotoxin III (MT-III)) and a P-I type hemorrhagic metalloproteinase (<el> BaP1 <le>) isolated from B. asper venom. Both enzymes induced prominent tissue alterations and conspicuous increments in interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6 and a number of MMPs, especially gelatinase MMP-9, rapidly after injection. In contrast, no increments in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma were detected. In agreement, MT-III and <el> BaP1 <le> did not induce the synthesis of TNF-alpha by resident peritoneal macrophages in vitro. Despite the conspicuous expression of latent forms of MMPs in muscle, evidenced by zymography, there were no increments in activated MMP-2 and only a small increase in activated MMP-9, as detected by a functional enzymatic assay. This suggests that MMP activity was regulated by a highly controlled activation of latent forms and, probably, by a concomitant synthesis of MMP inhibitors. Since no hemorrhage nor dermonecrosis were observed after injection of MT-III, despite a prominent increase in MMP expression, and since inflammatory exudate did not enhance hemorrhage induced by <el> BaP1 <le>, it is suggested that endogenous MMPs released in the tissue are not responsible for the dermonecrosis and hemorrhage characteristic of B. asper envenomation. Moreover, pretreatment of mice with the peptidomimetic MMP inhibitor batimastat did not reduce myotoxic nor edema-forming activities of MT-III, suggesting that MMPs do not play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of these effects in this experimental model. 
We tested the hypothesis that platelet-activating factor plays an important role in promoting <el> endotoxin <le>-induced <re> lung injury <er> by studying the effect of WEB 2086, a specific platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist, on lung vascular leak in <el> endotoxin <le>-treated rats. Intraperitoneal injection of Salmonella enteritidis <el> endotoxin <le> (2 mg/kg) increased the extravascular leakage of 125I-labeled albumin in perfused lungs at 30 min, 2 h, 6 h, and 48 h. Treatment with WEB 2086 (10 mg/kg ip) either 20 min before or 30 min after <el> endotoxin <le> injection significantly reduced <re> lung injury <er> at 2 h after <el> endotoxin <le> (leak index: control 0.74 +/- 0.03, <el> endotoxin <le> 1.79 +/- 0.14, <el> endotoxin <le> + pretreated WEB 1.23 +/- 0.09, <el> endotoxin <le> + posttreated WEB 1.21 +/- 0.13). In addition, posttreatment with WEB 2086 starting at 90 min after <el> endotoxin <le> injection markedly reduced lung leak at 6 h (control 0.74 +/- 0.03, <el> endotoxin <le> 1.29 +/- 0.14, <el> endotoxin <le> + WEB 0.71 +/- 0.06). The protective effect of WEB 2086 was not the result of cyclooxygenase blockade because the release of thromboxane B2 by <el> endotoxin <le>-treated lungs was not affected by WEB 2086. Furthermore, neither pretreatment nor posttreatment with WEB 2086 significantly reduced the <el> endotoxin <le>-induced increase in plasma glutathione disulfide, a marker of in vivo oxidative stress. In rats given a lethal dose of <el> endotoxin <le> (20 mg/kg ip), posttreatment with WEB 2086, starting at 2 h after <el> endotoxin <le>, significantly improved survival compared with vehicle treatment. 
We examined the down-regulation of alpha-1B adrenoceptors in Madin-Darby canine kidney D1 (MDCK) cells with an emphasis on a possible role of <re> protein kinase C <er>. The alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (1-100 microM) concentration-dependently down-regulated alpha-1B adrenoceptors in MDCK cells. Down-regulation by 100 microM phenylephrine was detectable after 2 hr and maximal after 8 to 24 hr. The receptor down-regulation was accompanied by a decrease in phenylephrine-stimulated inositol phosphate formation but not by an altered expression of immunodetectable Gq/11 alpha subunits. Even though alpha-1B adrenoceptor and P2 purinergic receptor stimulation promote prostaglandin E2 formation, receptor down-regulation was not prevented by indomethacin (10 microM) treatment but was partly mimicked by treatment with the purinergic receptor agonists adenosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate and 2-methylthio-ATP (300 microM each). Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (1-100 nM) concentration-dependently down-regulated MDCK alpha-1B adrenoceptors to a greater extent than did phenylephrine. Three <re> protein kinase C <er> inhibitors, H7 (100 microM), staurosporine (100 nM) and KT5926 (1 microM), markedly attenuated receptor down-regulation promoted by <el> phorbol ester <le> but did not affect that by phenylephrine. Two inhibitors of Ca++/calmodulin protein kinase pathways, KT5926 (1 microM) and W-7 (30 microM), also failed to prevent phenylephrine-induced down-regulation of alpha-1B adrenoceptors. 
The precursor cells that form the enteric nervous system (ENS) are multipotent when they arrive in the gut from the neural crest. Their <re> differentiation <er> thus depends on signals from the enteric microenvironment. Crest-derived cells were isolated from the fetal rat bowel by immunoselection at E14 with NC-1/HNK-1 antibodies and secondary antibodies coupled to magnetic beads. NC-1/HNK-1-immunoreactive cells were enriched approximately 36-fold. The NC-1/HNK-1-selected population and the residual population were plated at equal cell density and maintained in a defined medium for 6-7 d. The total number of cells found in the cultures of the residual cells was three- to fourfold that in cultures of immunoselected cells. Neurotrophin-3 (<el> NT-3 <le>), but not nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), or neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4/5), was found to increase the proportion of neurons (neurofilament-immunoreactive or neuron-specific enolase-immunoreactive) or glia (S-100-immunoreactive) (from 6.6 +/- 0.9% to 15.2 +/- 1.4%; p < 0.001). This effect was concentration dependent (from 1 to 40 ng/ml) and observed only in the cultures of immunoselected cells. <el> NT-3 <le> also enhanced neurite outgrowth. <el> NT-3 <le> increased neither cell number nor bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and thus was not mitogenic. Exposure of immunoselected cells to <el> NT-3 <le> rapidly and transiently induced the appearance of nuclear Fos immunoreactivity. Transcripts coding for TrkC, the transducing receptor for <el> NT-3 <le>, were identified in the fetal rat gut (E14-E16) and in the immunoselected population of cells using reverse transcriptase and the polymerase chain reaction. 
Ferrochelatase (FECH) is an enzyme necessary for <el> heme <le> synthesis, which is essential for maintaining normal functions of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). We tested the hypothesis that inhibition of vascular FECH to attenuate <el> heme <le> synthesis downregulates eNOS and <re> sGC expression <er>, resulting in impaired NO/cGMP-dependent relaxation. To this end, isolated bovine coronary arteries (BCAs) were in vitro incubated without (as controls) or with N-methyl protoporphyrin (NMPP; 10-5-10-7M; a selective FECH antagonist) for 24 and 72 hours respectively. Tissue FECH activity, <el> heme <le>, nitrite/NO and superoxide levels were sequentially measured. Protein expression of FECH, eNOS and sGC was detected by western blot analysis. Vascular responses to various vasoactive agents were evaluated via isometric tension studies. Treatment of BCAs with NMPP initiated a time- and dose-dependent attenuation of FECH activity without changes in its protein expression, followed by significant reduction in the <el> heme <le> level. Moreover, ACh-induced relaxation and ACh-stimulated release of NO were significant reduced, associated with suppression of eNOS protein expression in NMPP-treated groups. Decreased relaxation to NO donor spermine-NONOate reached the statistical significance in BCAs incubated with NMPP for 72 hours, concomitantly with downregulation of sGCβ1 expression that was independent of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), nor did it significantly affect BCA relaxation caused by BAY 58-2667 that activates sGC in the <el> heme <le>-deficiency. Neither vascular responses to non-NO/sGC-mediators nor production of superoxide was affected by NMPP-treatment. 
Both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia are featured by inflammatory responses and it is known that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) decrease the risk and severity of these diseases. To study the effect of NSAIDs on PGE2 levels and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels in the whole blood assay, blood samples from 23 elderly persons aged 85 years were stimulated with <el> thrombin <le> or LPS as primary stimulus. Indomethacin was added in concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 16 microg/ml and acetylsalicylic acid was added to in concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 8.0 microg/ml. Indomethacin abrogated <el> thrombin <le>- and LPS-induced PGE2 production at all concentrations tested. In addition, indomethacin reduced the production of <el> thrombin <le>-induced <re> IL-6 <er> and IL-10 (p<0.05) at physiological concentrations. Indomethacin reduced the production of LPS-induced <re> IL-6 <er>, IL-1 beta and IL-10 (p<0.05) at the highest indomethacin concentration tested. Similar results were obtained upon incubation with acetylsalicylic acid. 
Smooth muscle membrane potential (E(m)) depends on K(+) channels, and arteries from rats made hypertensive with N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine (<re> LHR <er>) are depolarized compared with control. We hypothesized that decreased K(+) channel function, due to decreased K(+) channel protein expression, underlies E(m) depolarization. Furthermore, K(+) channel blockers should move control E(m) (-46 +/- 1 mV) toward that in <re> LHR <er> (-37 +/- 2 mV) and normalize contraction. The E(m) vs. K(+) relationship was less steep in <re> LHR <er> (23 +/- 2 vs. 28 +/- 1 mV/log K(+) concentration), and contractile sensitivity to K(+) was increased (EC(50) = 37 +/- 1 vs. 23 +/- 1 mM). Iberiotoxin (10 nM), an inhibitor of large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (<el> BK <le>(Ca)) channels, depolarized control and <re> LHR <er> E(m) to -35 +/- 1 and -30 +/- 2 mV, respectively; however, effects on K(+) sensitivity were more profound in <re> LHR <er> (EC(50) = 25 +/- 2 vs. 15 +/- 3 mM). The voltage-dependent K(+) (K(V)) channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (3 mM) depolarized control E(m) to the level of <re> LHR <er> (-28 +/- 1 vs. -28 +/- 1 mV); however, effects on K(+) sensitivity were greater in <re> LHR <er> (EC(50) = 17 +/- 4 vs. 4 +/- 4 mM). Western blots revealed reduced <el> BK <le>(Ca) and K(V)1.5 channel expression in <re> LHR <er> arteries. The findings suggest that diminished expression of K(+) channels contributes to depolarization and enhanced contractile sensitivity. 
Both hyper- and hypothyroidism have been reported during prolonged recombinant human interferon-alpha (rhIFN alpha) therapy. To assess the short term effects of <el> IFN <le> alpha therapy on <re> thyroid hormone metabolism <er>, we measured thyroid hormone concentrations in eight healthy volunteers for 24 h after sc administration of rhIFN alpha and, on another occasion, after sc administration of saline (control study). There were no effects of rhIFN alpha on plasma T4 and free T4 or on thyroid hormone binding index. However, rhIFN alpha induced a significant decrease in the plasma concentrations of TSH (P < 0.03) and T3 (P < 0.02) compared with those in the control study, associated with an increase in rT3 concentrations (P < 0.02). <el> IFN <le> alpha induced a moderate increase in interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations (P < 0.02 vs. control study), whereas IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor concentrations remained below the detection limit in all subjects. 
The role of <re> nitric oxide <er> in ulcer formation remains unknown. Accordingly, we assessed local expression of inducible <re> nitric oxide <er> synthase (NOS) and nitration of tyrosine as an indicator of peroxynitrite formation in patients with Helicobacter pylori (<el> HP <le>)-associated gastric ulcers compared with <el> HP <le>-negative ulcers. Biopsy specimens were taken from the ulcer margin and from an area remote from the ulcer portion. Inducible NOS, nitrotyrosine, and macrophage immunoreactivity were assessed immunohistochemically using a labeled streptavidin-biotin method. In <el> HP <le>-positive gastric ulcers, inducible NOS and nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity was frequently observed at active ulcer margins, sometimes in surface epithelial cells as well as in the lamina propria. Occasionally, inducible NOS and nitrotyrosine reactivity were found in areas remote from the lesion in cases of <el> HP <le>-positive ulcer and <el> HP <le>-related gastritis. Macrophages accumulated significantly in the margin of <el> HP <le>-positive ulcers. In <el> HP <le>-negative gastric ulcers, inducible NOS and nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity also were frequent at the ulcer margin, but no significant immunoreactivity was observed at a distance. <el> HP <le> eradication caused significant attenuation in inducible NOS and macrophage immunoreactivity. 
The organic cation transporter-1 (OCT1) mediates the hepatocellular uptake of cationic drugs and endobiotics from sinusoidal blood. The uptake rates of these compounds may depend on OCT1 expression level. Because little is known about the regulation of the human OCT1 (<re> hOCT1 <er>) gene, we characterized the <re> hOCT1 <er> promoter with respect to DNA-response elements and their binding factors. By computer analysis, we identified two adjacent putative DNA-response elements for the liver-enriched homodimeric nuclear receptor hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha (<el> HNF-4alpha <le>) in the <re> hOCT1 <er> promoter. Each element is of the direct repeat (DR)-2 format, containing directly repeated hexamers separated by two bases. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, both elements directly interacted with <el> HNF-4alpha <le>. A luciferase reporter construct containing the <re> hOCT1 <er> promoter was strongly activated by <el> HNF-4alpha <le> in transiently transfected Huh7 cells. Site-directed mutagenesis of either DR-2 element alone or in combination severely decreased the <el> HNF-4alpha <le>-mediated activation of the <re> hOCT1 <er> promoter, indicating that both elements are functionally important. Because <el> HNF-4alpha <le> is a known target for bile acid-mediated suppression of transcription, we studied whether chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) suppresses <re> hOCT1 <er> gene expression by inhibiting <el> HNF-4alpha <le>-mediated transactivation. Treatment of cells with CDCA could indeed suppress the activation of the endogenous <re> hOCT1 <er> gene by <el> HNF-4alpha <le>. In addition, bile acid-inducible transcriptional repressor, small heterodimer partner (SHP), inhibited activation of the reporter-linked <re> hOCT1 <er> promoter and of the endogenous <re> hOCT1 <er> gene by <el> HNF-4alpha <le>. 
The alternatively activated macrophage phenotype induced by IL-10 is called M2c. Adenosine is an endogenous purine nucleoside that accumulates in the extracellular space in response to metabolic disturbances, hypoxia, inflammation, physical damage, or apoptosis. As <el> adenosine <le> is known to regulate classically activated M1 and IL4- and IL-13-activated M2a macrophages, the goal of the present study was to explore its effects on M2c macrophages. We found that <el> adenosine <le> augmented the IL-10-induced expression of TIMP-1 and arginase-1 by the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 and by mouse BMDMs. The effects of AR stimulation on IL-10-induced TIMP-1 or arginase-1 expression were lacking in A2BAR KO macrophages. The role of A2BAR on TIMP-1 production of RAW 264.7 cells was confirmed with specific agonist BAY606583 and antagonist PSB0788. AR stimulation augmented IL-10-induced <re> STAT3 <er> phosphorylation in macrophages, and pharmacological inhibition or silencing of <re> STAT3 <er> using siRNA reduced the stimulatory effect of AR stimulation on TIMP-1 production. In contrast to its stimulatory effect on IL-10-induced <re> STAT3 <er> activation, <el> adenosine <le> inhibited IL-6-induced <re> STAT3 <er> phosphorylation and SAA3 expression. 
The conversion of [1,2,6,7-3H]testosterone to [3H]<el> dihydrotestosterone <le> has been assessed in ground sp¿ongiosa of normal and osteoporotic bone. The tissue was obtained from 23 patients, 18 women, 3 men and 2 children who were undergoing orthopedic surgery. The formation of <el> dihydrotestosterone <le> was demonstrated in all samples examined. The half maximum rate of <el> dihydrotestosterone <le> formation occurred at a substrate concentration of 0.3 microM a value similar to that reported for <el> dihydrotestosterone <le> formation in other <re> androgen <er> target organs. Under the standardized conditions utilized in this study the rate of <el> dihydrotestosterone <le> formation did not differ significantly in normal as compared to osteoporotic bone. Furthermore, the conversion of testosterone to androstenedione was also similar in osteoporotic and normal bone. 
On the basis of our previous clinical experience, we hypothesized in this study that the duration and/or quality of labor analgesia produced by intrathecal <el> sufentanil <le> was less in <re> cocaine <er>-abusing parturients compared with nonabusing parturients. Ten micro g of <el> sufentanil <le> was given intrathecally as part of a combined spinal-epidural (CSE) technique to two groups of laboring parturients: 1). those whose urine tested positive for <re> cocaine <er> (<re> cocaine <er> group), and 2). those whose urine tested negative for <re> cocaine <er> (control group). The epidural catheter was not injected with local anesthetic until the patient requested additional pain relief. The time from injection of intrathecal <el> sufentanil <le> until patient request for additional pain relief was defined as duration of analgesia. Baseline visual analog pain score (VAPS) and cervical dilation were measured before the CSE was performed. After injection of intrathecal <el> sufentanil <le>, VAPS was recorded at specific intervals. Cervical dilation was again documented when the patient requested additional analgesia. We found that both groups reported high baseline VAPS and a marked decrease in VAPS after injection of <el> sufentanil <le> that did not differ between groups. Geometric mean duration of pain relief with adjustment for cervical dilation was 87 min in the <re> cocaine <er> group compared with 139 min in the control group (P = 0.019). All patients experienced itching. 
The effects of chronic (40%) food restriction from 6 weeks of age were studied in aging male Fisher 344 rats. When compared with 3-month-old, ad libitum fed rats, pineal N-acetyltransferase (<el> NAT <le>) activity had declined to less than 30% and pineal and serum levels of melatonin to 40% after 28 months when feeding had been ad libitum. Food restriction significantly retarded this development (P less than 0.05) giving <el> NAT <le> and melatonin levels which were twice as high as in the ad libitum fed group. Nighttime levels of pineal serotonin (<re> 5-HT <er>) were similar in food-restricted and ad libitum fed old rats but were nearly twice as high (P less than 0.05) as in young rats. There was also a tendency for increased production of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the pineal gland with higher levels of <re> 5-HT <er>. 
The small GTPase, <el> Rho <le>A, and its downstream effecter <el> Rho <le>-kinase (ROK) are reported to be involved in various cellular functions, such as myosin light chain phosphorylation during smooth muscle contraction and exocytosis. Indeed, growing evidence suggests that the <el> Rho <le>A/<el> Rho <le>-kinase pathway plays an important role in regulating exocytosis in these cells. However, it is not known whether the <el> Rho <le>A/<el> Rho <le>-kinase pathway has an effect on catecholamine synthesis. Using the rat pheochromocytoma cell line, PC12, we examined the effects of either <el> Rho <le>-kinase inhibitor (Y27632) or <el> Rho <le>A inhibitor (C3 toxin) on nicotine-induced catecholamine biosynthesis. We show that nicotine (10 microM) induces a significant, though transient, increase in <el> Rho <le>A activation in these cells. Treatment with either Y27632 (1 microM) or C3 toxin (10 microg/ml) significantly inhibited the nicotine-induced increase of tyrosine hydroxylase (<re> TH <er>) mRNA and the corresponding enzyme activity. <re> TH <er> catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of catecholamine. Y27632 significantly inhibited nicotine-induced phosphorylation of <re> TH <er> at Ser40 as well as Ser19, which are known to be phosphorylated by Ca(2+)/calmodulin kinase II. Furthermore, Y27632 (10 microM) as well as C3 toxin (10 microg/ml) significantly inhibited the nicotine-induced increase of <re> TH <er> at the protein level. Thus, we propose that activation of <el> Rho <le>A, and its downstream effecter <el> Rho <le>-kinase, is a prerequisite for catecholamine biosynthesis in PC12 cells. At the concentrations used in our experiments, Y27632 does not affect cAMP/PKA activity or PKC activity, indicating that the inhibitory effect of Y27632 can be attributed to the inhibition of <el> Rho <le>-kinase activity as observed in chromaffin cells. In contrast, neither Y27632 (10 microM) nor C3 toxin (10 microg/ml) significantly altered catecholamine secretion in PC12 cells. 
The extracellular conversion of lung <re> surfactant <er> from tubular myelin to the small vesicular form has previously been shown to require a serine-active enzyme called "<re> surfactant <er> convertase." In the present study, a 72kD serine-active enzyme previously identified in mouse lung alveolar lavage and having convertase activity was partially sequenced. Sixty-eight residues obtained from amino acid sequencing of this protein show that it is a new member of the mouse <el> carboxylesterase <le> family (EC 3.1.1.1). The 72kD lung protein also has esterase activity. A commercial esterase of the same family was able to reproduce <re> surfactant <er> convertase bioactivity in vitro, unlike several serine proteinases previously tested. 
Beta-asarone has significant pharmacological effects on the central nervous system. It can attenuate neuronal apoptosis, but its effects on the brain ischemia-reperfusion-induced <re> autophagy <er> have not been reported yet. Our study was a two-stage procedure: evaluation of <el> β-asarone <le> effects on the <re> autophagy <er> at first, and then analysis of the possible mechanism. The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was adopted to make the brain injure and Beclin 1 was used to evaluate the <re> autophagy <er>. We hypothesized that the mechanism might be related to c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), phospho-JNK (p-JNK), Bcl-2 and Beclin 1. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated JNK, p-JNK, Bcl-2 and Beclin 1 levels with flow cytometry. Additionally, we divided the brain into three regions: ischemic region, ischemic penumbra, and normal region, and analyzed them respectively. We found, compared to both groups II (model control) and III (low dose), Beclin 1 levels in groups IV (medium dose) and V (high dose) were significantly decreased. Beclin 1, JNK and p-JNK levels in groups VII (<el> β-asarone <le>) and VIII (JNK inhibitor) were significantly decreased, but Bcl-2 levels were significantly increased. Additionally, Beclin 1, JNK, p-JNK and Bcl-2 levels among the three regions had no significant differences. 
Receptor-interacting protein (RIP) plays a critical role in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced IkappaB kinase (IKK) activation and subsequent activation of transcription factor <re> NF-kappaB <er>. However, the molecular mechanism by which RIP mediates TNF-alpha-induced <re> NF-kappaB <er> activation is not completely defined. In this study, we have found that <el> TAK1 <le> is recruited to the TNF-alpha receptor complex in a RIP-dependent manner following the stimulation of TNF-alpha receptor 1 (TNF-R1). Moreover, a forced recruitment of <el> TAK1 <le> to TNF-R1 in the absence of RIP is sufficient to mediate TNF-alpha-induced <re> NF-kappaB <er> activation, indicating that the major function of RIP is to recruit its downstream kinases to the TNF-R1 complex. Interestingly, we also find that <el> TAK1 <le> and MEKK3 form a functional complex, in which <el> TAK1 <le> regulates autophosphorylation of MEKK3. The <el> TAK1 <le>-mediated regulation of MEKK3 phosphorylation is dependent on the kinase activity of <el> TAK1 <le>. Although <el> TAK1 <le>-MEKK3 interaction is not affected by overexpressed TAB1, TAB1 is required for <el> TAK1 <le> activation and subsequent MEKK3 phosphorylation. 
In the present study we report the properties of vasopressin (VP) receptors in the anterior pituitary gland and show that the number of these receptors is markedly affected by adrenalectomy and hypothalamic lesions. VP-binding activity was assayed in particulate fractions of rat anterior pituitary glands using tritium-labeled arginine VP ([3H] <re> AVP <er>) as tracer. In the presence of Mg2+ the radioligand interacted with a single class of high affinity, low capacity binding sites. <el> Magnesium ions <le> modulated the affinity of the receptors but had no effect on binding capacity. Guanine nucleotides decreased the amount of tracer bound in a dose-dependent manner by increasing the dissociation constant (Kd) of the binding reaction by approximately 2-fold. Increasing the concentration of Mg2+ did not prevent this effect. Bilateral adrenalectomy (ADX) decreased pituitary <re> AVP <er>-binding activity: binding fell by 30% 4 h after surgery and declined further to 10% or less of control at 4 days. The decrease in binding was primarily due to a reduction in the number of receptors. Daily administration of corticosterone inhibited the reduction of binding activity at 4 days in a dose-dependent manner. Destruction of hypophyseotropic VP neurons by means of surgical lesioning of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus or the medial basal hypothalamus abolished the effect of ADX on pituitary <re> AVP <er> binding at 24 h but only attenuated the degree of receptor loss at 4 days. Furthermore, the lesions themselves caused a significant (approximately 30%) reduction in receptor number 4-7 days after hypothalamic surgery. Adrenalectomy reduced pituitary <re> AVP <er>-binding activity in homozygous (di/di) Brattleboro rats. The extent as well as the time course of the loss of receptor activity resembled that in normal rats. Rat anterior pituitary segments were exposed to synthetic CRF, <re> AVP <er>, or oxytocin (all 10(-7) M) for 4 h in vitro, and [3H] <re> AVP <er>-binding activity was subsequently determined. Both <re> AVP <er> and oxytocin reduced the amount of radioligand bound, while CRF had no effect. 
<el> GH <le> treatment increases protein deposition and the efficiency of dietary protein used for growth. To identify the mechanisms that regulate tissue <re> protein synthesis <er> in response to exogenous <el> GH <le> treatment, fully fed, growing swine were treated with <el> GH <le> for 7 d. Fasted and fed pigs were infused with [1-(13)C]leucine to determine <re> protein synthesis <er> rates, and translation initiation factor activity levels were measured in skeletal muscle and liver. Feeding increased <re> protein synthesis <er> and translational efficiency in both muscle and liver of control and <el> GH <le>-treated pigs, and this was associated with increased 4E-BP1 and S6 kinase 1 phosphorylation, decreased association of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E with 4E-BP1, and increased association of eIF4E with eIF4G. <el> GH <le> increased muscle <re> protein synthesis <er> and translational efficiency in fed pigs. <el> GH <le> increased liver <re> protein synthesis <er> of fasted and fed pigs in association with increased ribosome number. In muscle, but not liver, <el> GH <le> increased eIF2B activity and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in both the fasted and fed state and increased the association of eIF4E with eIF4G in the fed state. 
CYP2J2 is abundant in cardiomyocytes and is involved in the metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA) to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which affect multiple cell functions. In this study, we investigated the effect of <re> overexpression of CYP2J2 <er> on cardiac L-type Ca2+ currents (<el> ICa <le>) in adult transgenic mice. Cardiac-specific <re> overexpression of CYP2J2 <er> was achieved using the alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter. <el> ICa <le> was recorded from isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes. Compared with the wild-type cardiomyocytes (n = 60), the density of <el> ICa <le> was significantly increased by 40 +/- 9% in the CYP2J2 transgenic cardiomyocytes (n = 71; P < 0.001). N-Methylsulfonyl-6-(2-proparglyloxyphenyl)hexanamide (MS-PPOH), a specific inhibitor of EET biosynthesis, and clotrimazole, a cytochrome P450 inhibitor, significantly reduced <el> ICa <le> in both wild-type and transgenic cardiomyocytes; however, MS-PPOH inhibited <el> ICa <le> to a greater extent in the CYP2J2 transgenic cells (n = 10) than in the wild-type cells (n = 10; P < 0.01). Addition of 11,12-EET significantly restored <el> ICa <le> in MS-PPOH-treated cells. Intracellular dialysis with either of two inhibitory monoclonal antibodies against CYP2J2 significantly reduced <el> ICa <le> in both wild-type and transgenic mice. Membrane-permeable 8-bromo-cAMP and the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol significantly reversed the monoclonal antibody-induced inhibition of <el> ICa <le>. In addition, the total protein level of the alpha1 subunit of the Cav1.2 L-type Ca2+ channel was not altered in CYP2J2 transgenic hearts, but the phosphorylated portion was markedly increased. 
<el> IL-1β <le> is a prominent proinflammatory cytokine that mediates degradation of extracellular matrix proteins through increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases, which involves a signaling pathway in adherent cells that is restricted by focal <re> adhesion <er>s. Currently, the mechanism by which <el> IL-1β <le> affects cell <re> adhesion <er> to matrix proteins is not defined, and it is not known whether degraded matrix proteins affect <el> IL-1β <le> signaling. We examined <re> adhesion <er>-related <el> IL-1β <le> signaling in fibroblasts attaching to native or MMP3-degraded fibronectin. <el> IL-1β <le> increased cell attachment, resistance to shear force and the numbers of focal <re> adhesion <er>s containing activated β(1) integrins. <el> IL-1β <le>-enhanced attachment required FAK, kindlins 1/2, and talin. MMP3-degraded fibronectin-inhibited <el> IL-1β <le>-enhanced cell <re> adhesion <er> and promoted spontaneous ERK activation that was independent of <el> IL-1β <le> treatment. 
We have studied the effects of nitrous oxide on cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and intracranial pressure (ICP) during <el> isoflurane <le>-induced <re> hypotension <er> in 10 pigs. CBF was measured using laser Doppler flowmetry, CBFV in the right middle cerebral artery was calculated using Doppler ultrasound and ICP was measured using an extradural ICP monitor. Each animal was studied under four conditions, examined sequentially: (i) mean intra-arterial pressure (MAP) 85 mm Hg, maintained with <el> isoflurane <le>, (ii) MAP 50-55 mm Hg, induced by <el> isoflurane <le> only, (iii) MAP 85 mm Hg, maintained with <el> isoflurane <le> and 50% nitrous oxide, and (iv) MAP 50-55 mm Hg, induced by <el> isoflurane <le> and 50% nitrous oxide. No significant differences were noted between conditions with respect to ICP. There was a significant difference in CBF during condition (ii) compared with (i) (mean 75(SD 21) vs 100(0)%) and during condition (iv) compared with (iii) (90(26) vs 109(13)%). Animals under condition (iv) exhibited a 20% reduction in CBFV compared with those under condition (iii) (57 vs 69 cm s-1). For animals under normotensive conditions, addition of nitrous oxide to <el> isoflurane <le> resulted in a 16% increase in CBFV (69 vs 60 cm s-1). Comparing <el> isoflurane <le>-induced <re> hypotension <er> ((ii) vs (iv)), there was no statistical difference in either CBF or CBFV on addition of 50% nitrous oxide. The correlation between changes in CBF and CBFV was not significant. 
Neuronal cells undergo rapid growth cone collapse, neurite retraction, and cell rounding in response to certain G protein-coupled receptor agonists such as lysophosphatidic acid (<el> LPA <le>). These shape changes are driven by Rho-mediated contraction of the actomyosin-based cytoskeleton. To date, however, detection of Rho activation has been hampered by the lack of a suitable assay. Furthermore, the nature of the G protein(s) mediating <el> LPA <le>-induced neurite retraction remains unknown. We have developed a Rho activation assay that is based on the specific binding of active <re> RhoA <er> to its downstream effector Rho-kinase (ROK). A fusion protein of GST and the Rho-binding domain of ROK pulls down activated but not inactive <re> RhoA <er> from cell lysates. Using GST-ROK, we show that in N1E-115 neuronal cells <el> LPA <le> activates endogenous <re> RhoA <er> within 30 s, concomitant with growth cone collapse. Maximal activation occurs after 3 min when neurite retraction is complete and the actin cytoskeleton is fully contracted. <el> LPA <le>-induced <re> RhoA <er> activation is completely inhibited by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tyrphostin 47 and genistein). Activated Galpha12 and Galpha13 subunits mimic <el> LPA <le> both in activating <re> RhoA <er> and in inducing <re> RhoA <er>-mediated cytoskeletal contraction, thereby preventing neurite outgrowth. 
Cross-talk between insulin-like growth factor 1 (<el> IGF-1 <le>) and estrogen receptor alpha (ER) regulates gene expression in breast cancer cells, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we studied how 17-beta-estradiol (E2) and <el> IGF-1 <le> affect <re> ER transcription <er>al machinery in MCF-7 cells. E2 treatment stimulated ER loading on the estrogen response element (ERE) in the pS2 promoter and on the AP-1 motif in the cyclin D1 promoter. On ERE, similar amounts of liganded ER were found at 1-24-h time points, whereas on AP-1, ER binding fluctuated over time. At 1 h, liganded ER was recruited to ERE together with histone acetyltransferases SRC-1 and p300, ubiquitin ligase E6-AP, histone methyltransferase Carm1 (Carm), and polymerase (pol) II. This coincided with increased histone H3 acetylation and up-regulation of pS2 mRNA levels. At the same time, E2 moderately increased cyclin D1 expression, which was associated with the recruitment of liganded ER, SRC-1, p300, ubiquitin ligase E6-AP (E6L), Mdm2, and pol II, but not other regulatory proteins, to AP-1. In contrast, at 1 h, <el> IGF-1 <le> increased the recruitment of the ER.SRC-1.p300.E6L.Mdm2.Carm.pol II complex on AP-1, but not on ERE, and induced cyclin D1, but not pS2, mRNA expression. Notably, ER knockdown reduced the association of ER, E6L, Mdm2, Carm, and pol II with AP-1 and resulted in down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression. <el> IGF-1 <le> potentiated the effects of E2 on ERE but not to AP-1 and increased E2-dependent pS2, but not cyclin D1, mRNA expression. 
This study tested the ability of a novel adipose tissue derived cytokine, C1q TNF Related Protein 3 (<el> CTRP3 <le>), to prevent alcohol-induced hepatic lipid accumulation, or alcoholic fatty liver disease (ALD). Previous work has demonstrated that <el> CTRP3 <le> is effective at preventing high fat diet-induced fatty liver, however, the potential of <el> CTRP3 <le> to inhibit ALD has not been explored. To test the potential protective effects of <el> CTRP3 <le>, transgenic mice overexpressing <el> CTRP3 <le> (Tg) or wildtype littermates (WT) were subjected to one of two different models of ALD. In the first model, known as the NIAAA model, mice were fed control or alcohol-containing liquid diets (5% v/v) for 10 days followed by a single gavage of ethanol (5 g/kg). In the second model, the chronic model, mice were fed control or alcohol-containing diets for 6 weeks with no gavage. This study found that <el> CTRP3 <le> reduced <re> triglyceride <er> accumulation in the chronic model of alcohol consumption by ~50%, whereas no reduction was observed in the NIAAA model. Further analysis of isolated primary hepatocytes from WT and Tg mice demonstrated that <el> CTRP3 <le> increased oxygen consumption in the presence of fatty acids, indicating that <el> CTRP3 <le> increases hepatic fatty acid utilization. 
The type 2 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP(3)R2) was identified previously as the predominant isoform in cardiac ventricular myocytes. Here we reported the subcellular localization of InsP(3)R2 to the cardiomyocyte nuclear envelope (NE). The other major known endo/sarcoplasmic reticulum <el> calcium <le>-release channel (ryanodine receptor) was not localized to the NE, indicating functional segregation of these channels and possibly a unique role for InsP(3)R2 in regulating nuclear <el> calcium <le> dynamics. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the NE InsP(3)R2 associates with Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIdelta (<re> CaMKII <er>delta), the major isoform expressed in cardiac myocytes. Recombinant InsP(3)R2 and <re> CaMKII <er>delta(B) also co-immunoprecipitated after co-expression in COS-1 cells. Additionally, the amino-terminal 1078 amino acids of the InsP(3)R2 were sufficient for interaction with <re> CaMKII <er>delta(B) and associated upon mixing following separate expression. <re> CaMKII <er> can also phosphorylate InsP(3)R2, as demonstrated by (32)P labeling. Incorporation of <re> CaMKII <er>-treated InsP(3)R2 into planar lipid bilayers revealed that InsP(3)-mediated channel open probability is significantly reduced ( approximately 11 times) by phosphorylation via <re> CaMKII <er>. 
In seven alpha-chloralose anesthetized dogs we examined the contribution of lung afferents to the rapid, shallow breathing induced by inhalation of 10 breaths of <el> histamine <le> aerosol. In four spontaneously breathing dogs, the inhalation of <el> histamine <le> caused an increased respiratory frequency, decreased tidal volume, and decreased dynamic lung compliance. Selective blockade of pulmonary C-fibers abolished a reflex-induced increase in respiratory frequency but did not significantly affect the reductions in tidal volume or lung compliance. Terbutaline treatment in combination with C-fiber blockade abolished the reductions in tidal volume and lung compliance induced by <el> histamine <le>. In three separate alpha-chloralose anesthetized, open-chest, mechanically ventilated dogs, we recorded an increase in the inspiratory activity of rapidly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors (<re> RAR <er>s) induced by the inhalation of <el> histamine <le> aerosol. Selective C-fiber blockade abolished <el> histamine <le>-induced increases in <re> RAR <er> activity while only partially attenuating reductions in lung compliance. 
In previous studies, neutral endopeptidase (<el> NEP <le>) hydrolyzed the Cys105-Phe106 bond of atrial natriuretic peptides (<re> ANP <er>) in vitro. Three such ring-opened peptides derived from <re> ANP <er> 99-126, 103-126, and 103-123 were inactive in conscious rats. In conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) in the present study, 100 mumol/kg, intravenously (i.v.) of the <el> NEP <le> inhibitor, SQ 29,072 (7-[[2-(mercaptomethyl)-1-oxo-3-phenyl-propyl]amino]heptanoic acid), significantly increased the area over the curve (AOC) of the depressor response to 3 nmol/kg of <re> ANP <er> 103-126 from 165 +/- 36 to 792 +/- 350, 1,515 +/- 374, and 828 +/- 164 mm Hg.min at 15, 30, and 60 min after inhibitor treatment. Thirty minutes after 3, 10, 30, and 100 mumol/kg of SQ 29,072, the AOC of 3 nmol/kg of <re> ANP <er> 99-126 increased from 175 +/- 59 mm Hg.min in vehicle-treated rats to 296 +/- 100, 318 +/- 34, 632 +/- 194 (p less than 0.05) and 656 +/- 151 (p less than 0.05) mm Hg.min. Furthermore, 100 mumol/kg of SQ 29,072 potentiated the AOC of human <re> ANP <er> 99-126 and 105-126 and rat <re> ANP <er> 99-126, 103-126, and 103-123, suggesting that the exocyclic N-terminal residues and the C-terminal tripeptide did not influence <re> ANP <er> potentiation by SQ 29,072. In contrast, inhibitors of aminopeptidase, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and serine protease and an arginine vasopressin (AVP) antagonist did not substantially affect the AOC of 3 nmol/kg <re> ANP <er> 99-126. Finally, SQ 29,072 did not alter the activities of bradykinin, AVP, or angiotensin I or II. 
The class II transactivator (<re> CIITA <er>) is a transcriptional co-activator regulating the constitutive and interferon-gamma-inducible expression of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and related genes. Promoter remodeling occurs following <re> CIITA <er> induction, suggesting the involvement of chromatin remodeling factors. Transcription of numerous genes requires the histone acetyltransferase (<el> HAT <le>) activities of CREB-binding protein (CBP), p300, and/or p300/CBP-associated factor (pCAF). These co-activators cooperate with <re> CIITA <er> and are hypothesized to promote class II major histocompatibility complex transcription through their <el> HAT <le> activity. To directly test this, we used <el> HAT <le>-defective CBP and pCAF. We demonstrate that cooperation between <re> CIITA <er> and CBP is independent of CBP <el> HAT <le> activity. Further, although pCAF enhances <re> CIITA <er>-mediated transcription, pCAF <el> HAT <le> domain dependence appears contingent upon the concentration of available <re> CIITA <er>. When <el> HAT <le>-defective CBP and pCAF are both present, cooperativity with <re> CIITA <er> is maintained. Consistent with a recent report, we show that nuclear localization of <re> CIITA <er> is enhanced by lysine 144, an in vitro target of pCAF-mediated <el> HAT <le>. Yet we find that neither mutation of lysine 144 nor deletion of residues 132-209 affects transcriptional cooperation with CBP or pCAF. Thus, acetylation of this residue may not be the primary mechanism for pCAF/CBP cooperation with <re> CIITA <er>. 
PFK-2/FBPase-2 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase) catalyses the formation and degradation of fructose 2,6-P(2) (fructose 2,6-bisphosphate) and is also a glucokinase-binding protein. The role of fructose 2,6-P(2) in regulating <el> glucose <le> metabolism and <re> insulin secretion <er> in pancreatic beta-cells is unresolved. We down-regulated the endogenous isoforms of PFK-2/FBPase-2 with siRNA (small interfering RNA) and expressed KA (kinase active) and KD (kinase deficient) variants to distinguish between the role of PFK-2/FBPase-2 protein and the role of its product, fructose 2,6-P(2), in regulating beta-cell function. Human islets expressed the PFKFB2 (the gene encoding isoform 2 of the PFK2/FBPase2 protein) and PFKFB3 (the gene encoding isoform 3 of the PFK2/FBPase2 protein) isoforms and mouse islets expressed PFKFB2 at the mRNA level [RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR)]. Rat islets expressed PFKFB2 lacking the C-terminal phosphorylation sites. The <el> glucose <le>-responsive MIN6 and INS1E cell lines expressed PFKFB2 and PFKFB3. PFK-2 activity and the cell content of fructose 2,6-P(2) were increased by elevated <el> glucose <le> concentration and during pharmacological activation of AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase), which also increased <re> insulin secretion <er>. Partial down-regulation of endogenous PFKFB2 and PFKFB3 in INS1E by siRNA decreased PFK-2/FBPase-2 protein, fructose 2,6-P(2) content, glucokinase activity and <el> glucose <le>induced <re> insulin secretion <er>. Selective down-regulation of <el> glucose <le>-induced fructose 2,6-P(2) in the absence of down-regulation of PFK-2/FBPase-2 protein, using a KD PFK-2/FBPase-2 variant, resulted in sustained glycolysis and elevated <el> glucose <le>-induced <re> insulin secretion <er>, indicating an over-riding role of PFK-2/FBPase-2 protein, as distinct from its product fructose 2,6-P(2), in potentiating <el> glucose <le>-induced <re> insulin secretion <er>. Whereas down-regulation of PFK-2/FBPase-2 decreased glucokinase activity, overexpression of PFK-2/FBPase-2 only affected glucokinase distribution. 
The effect of Neo Red Cells (NRC), liposome-encapsulated hemoglobin, on production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (<re> TNF-alpha <er>) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were studied in whole blood preparations ex vivo. Venous blood was collected with heparin and incubated in a CO2 incubator. Treatment of blood samples with NRC reduced the constitutive levels of <re> TNF-alpha <er> and IL-6. Lipopolysaccharide (<el> LPS <le>) treatment for 24 h increased production of <re> TNF-alpha <er> and IL-6 in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment with NRC (5%) for 24 h markedly potentiated the <el> LPS <le>-induced <re> TNF-alpha <er> production and, that of IL-6 to a lesser extent. Northern blotting analysis of total RNA in whole blood showed that pretreatment with NRC caused a marked increase in <re> TNF-alpha <er> mRNA expression in response to <el> LPS <le>. 
One hundred and ninety-three children with T-cell acute lymphocytic <re> leukemia <er> (T-ALL) whose <re> leukemia <er> cells were E-rosette positive were treated on a Pediatric Oncology Group study (1979-1986) designed specifically for patients with T-ALL. The results of modified LSA2L2 therapy with or without intensified intrathecal chemotherapy and cranial irradiation (radiotherapy) were compared with those obtained using a simpler <el> multi <le>-agent protocol which included radiotherapy (T-cell 2). The complete remission (approximately 90%) and 3-year event-free survival rates (approximately 40%) were similar in the three treatment groups. However, the pattern of extramedullary relapse varied according to specific treatment regimen. Patients who received LSA2L2 therapy with less intensive intrathecal chemotherapy and no radiotherapy had a central nervous system (CNS) relapse rate (i.e. isolated CNS +/- other site) of over 20%, compared to only 10% for patients receiving the same systemic chemotherapy with intensified intrathecal therapy and radiotherapy, and less than 5% for those receiving T-cell 2 therapy. In contrast, males receiving T-cell 2 therapy had a testicular relapse rate of greater than 20% compared to less than 10% for patients receiving either regimen (i.e. +/- intensified intrathecal chemotherapy and radiotherapy) of modified LSA2L2 therapy. 
It is well established that epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces the cytoskeleton reorganization and <re> cell migration <er> through two major signaling cascades: phospholipase C-gamma1 (<el> PLC-gamma1 <le>) and Rho GTPases. However, little is known about the cross talk between <el> PLC-gamma1 <le> and Rho GTPases. Here we showed that <el> PLC-gamma1 <le> forms a complex with Rac1 in response to EGF. This interaction is direct and mediated by <el> PLC-gamma1 <le> Src homology 3 (SH3) domain and Rac1 (106)PNTP(109) motif. This interaction is critical for EGF-induced Rac1 activation in vivo, and <el> PLC-gamma1 <le> SH3 domain is actually a potent and specific Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor in vitro. We have also demonstrated that the interaction between <el> PLC-gamma1 <le> SH3 domain and Rac1 play a significant role in EGF-induced F-actin formation and <re> cell migration <er>. 
Gallic acid (<el> GA <le>) induces <re> apoptosis <er> in various cancer cell lines. In this study, we investigated the apoptotic activity induced by <el> GA <le> on chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell line-K562 and the underlying mechanism. <el> GA <le> reduced the viability of K562 cells in a dose and time dependent manner. <el> GA <le> led to G0/G1 phase arrest in K562 cells by promoting p21 and p27 and inhibiting the levels of cyclin D and cyclin E. Further studies indicated <re> apoptosis <er> with impaired mitochondrial function as a result of deranged Bcl-2/Bax ratio, leakage of cytochrome c and PARP cleavage along with DNA fragmentation and by up-regulating the expression of caspase-3. <el> GA <le> also activated the protein expressions of fatty acid synthase ligand and caspase-8. <el> GA <le> is more effective in imatinib resistant-K562 (IR-K562) cells (IC50 4 μM) than on K562 cells (IC50 33 μM). <el> GA <le> inhibited cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in K562 as well as IR-K562 cells appears to be COX-2 involved in the suppression of growth. Interestingly, <el> GA <le> also inhibited BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase and NF-κB. 
Licochalcone E (lico E) is a retrochalcone isolated from the root of Glycyrrhiza inflata. Retrochalcone compounds evidence a variety of pharmacological profiles, including anticancer, antiparasitic, antibacterial, antioxidative and superoxide-scavenging properties. In this study, we evaluated the biological effects of lico E on <re> adipocyte differentiation <er> in vitro and obesity-related diabetes in vivo. We employed 3T3-L1 preadipocyte and C3H10T1/2 stem cells for in vitro <re> adipocyte differentiation <er> study and diet-induced diabetic mice for in vivo study. The presence of lico E during adipogenesis induced <re> adipocyte differentiation <er> to a significant degree, particularly at the early induction stage. Licochalcone E evidenced weak, but significant, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (<el> PPAR <le>γ) ligand-binding activity. Two weeks of lico E treatment lowered blood glucose levels and serum triglyceride levels in the diabetic mice. Additionally, treatment with lico E resulted in marked reductions in adipocyte size and increases in the mRNA expression levels of <el> PPAR <le>γ in white adipose tissue (WAT). Licochalcone E was also shown to significantly stimulate Akt signaling in epididymal WAT. 
The influence of brain cholinergic activation on hepatic <re> glycogenolysis <er> and gluconeogenesis was studied in fed and 48-hour fasted rats. Neostigmine was injected into the third cerebral ventricle and hepatic venous plasma glucose, <el> glucagon <le>, insulin, and epinephrine were measured. The activity of hepatic phosphorylase-a and phosphoenolpyruvate-carboxykinase (PEP-CK) was also measured. Experimental groups: 1, intact rats; 2, rats infused with somatostatin through the femoral vein; 3, bilateral adrenodemedullated (ADMX) rats; 4, somatostatin infused ADMX rats; 5, 5-methoxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (MICA) was injected intraperitoneally 30 minutes before injection of neostigmine into the third cerebral ventricle of intact rats. MICA treatment completely suppressed the increase in hepatic glucose in fasted rats, but had no effect in fed rats. Phosphorylase-a activity was not changed in fasted rats, but increased in fed rats, intact rats, somatostatin-infused rats, somatostatin-infused ADMX rats, and ADMX rats in that order. PEP-CK was not changed in fed rats, but increased at 60 and 120 minutes after neostigmine injection into the third cerebral ventricle in fasted rats. 
The key pathological link between obesity and type 2 diabetes is <el> insulin <le> resistance, but the molecular mechanisms are not entirely identified. micro-RNAs (miRNA) are dysregulated in obesity and may contribute to <el> insulin <le> resistance. Our objective was to detect and functionally investigate miRNAs linked to <el> insulin <le> sensitivity in human subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT). Subjects were selected based on the <el> insulin <le>-stimulated <re> lipogenesis <er> response of subcutaneous adipocytes. Global miRNA profiling was performed in abdominal scWAT of 18 obese <el> insulin <le>-resistance (OIR), 21 obese <el> insulin <le>-sensitive (OIS), and 9 lean women. miRNAs demonstrating differential expression between OIR and OIS women were overexpressed in human in vitro-differentiated adipocytes followed by assessment of <re> lipogenesis <er> and identification of miRNA targets by measuring mRNA/protein expression and 3'-untranslated region analysis. Eleven miRNAs displayed differential expression between OIR and OIS states. Overexpression of miR-143-3p and miR-652-3p increased <el> insulin <le>-stimulated <re> lipogenesis <er> in human in vitro differentiated adipocytes and directly or indirectly affected several genes/proteins involved in <el> insulin <le> signaling at transcriptional or posttranscriptional levels. Adipose expression of miR-143-3p and miR-652-3p was positively associated with <el> insulin <le>-stimulated <re> lipogenesis <er> in scWAT independent of body mass index. 
Abnormalities of GH secretion and clearance are well-documented in poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), but the contribution of the receptor (<re> GHR <er>) and the GH-binding protein (GHBP) to these abnormalities has not been defined. We studied the expression of the <re> GHR <er>/GHBP gene in the livers, hearts and kidneys in streptozocin-induced diabetes (<el> STZ-D <le>) in the rat. <re> GHR <er> and GHBP mRNA levels were measured by Northern blot and ribonuclease protection assays. Whereas levels of <re> GHR <er> and GHBP mRNA were significantly decreased in liver and heart of <el> STZ-D <le> rats when compared with the control group (P < 0.01), <re> GHR <er> mRNA was significantly increased in the kidneys of <el> STZ-D <le> rats (P = 0.03). Six days of insulin treatment did not significantly alter the levels of <re> GHR <er>/GHBP mRNA in the liver or heart of <el> STZ-D <le> rats, but significantly decreased GHBP mRNA (P = 0.04) in the kidney. Circulating IGF-I was reduced, as was IGF-I mRNA in the liver and heart of <el> STZ-D <le> rats; only circulating IGF-I was restored by insulin treatment. Neither <el> STZ-D <le> nor insulin treatment affected IGF-I or IGF-I receptor mRNA concentrations in the kidney. 
Primary cultures of rabbit hepatocytes were used to examine the effect of natural and synthetic antioxidants--polyhydroxynaphthoquinones (PHNQ) and alpha-tocopherol on <re> cholesterol <er> and bile acid synthesis. Histochrome, one of the PHNQ, slightly decreased <re> cholesterol <er> synthesis at concentrations 10-100 microM, whereas alpha-tocopherol stimulated <re> cholesterol <er> synthesis. After administration of <el> histochrome <le> or alpha-tocopherol into culture medium a significant stimulation of bile acid synthesis in dose-dependent manner was observed. The increase of bile acid secretion by <el> histochrome <le> in the presence of physiological concentration of HDL2 was found as well. 
The effect of growth hormone (<el> GH <le>) on binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to liver membrane preparations was investigated in hypophysectomized <re> mice <er> and partially <el> GH <le>-deficient, genetic mutant "little" (lit/lit) <re> mice <er>. The EGF binding of normal male <re> mice <er> and testosterone-treated females was higher than in normal females. Due to diminished receptor concentration, hepatic EGF binding was decreased in male and female lit/lit <re> mice <er> to a level that was unaffected by gender or androgen treatment. <el> GH <le> replacement therapy by intermittent injections and continuous infusion restored the EGF binding of hypophysectomized <re> mice <er> to normal male and female levels, respectively, suggesting a role for the more pulsatile <el> GH <le> secretion in normal males. In lit/lit <re> mice <er>, however, both continuous and intermittent <el> GH <le> resulted in EGF binding levels comparable to those in normal females. In normal males continuous <el> GH <le> suppressed EGF binding. 
Rat hearts were perfused by means of the Langendorff's technique and paced at 150/min. Oxygen saturation level of myocardial <el> myoglobin <le> was measured continuously according to an optical method, by which the intracellular <re> oxygen <er> level in the myocardial cells can be monitored continuously. Krebs-Henseleit solution was bubbled with a gas mixture containing either 95% O2 + 5% CO2 (high <re> oxygen <er> solution) or 95% N2 + 5% CO2 (anoxic solution), or both (low <re> oxygen <er> solution). Hypoxia was produced by changing the perfusion fluid from high to low <re> oxygen <er> solution. After 10 min of hypoxia, drugs were infused into the inflow tube at a rate of 0.1 ml/min for 10 min. Hypoxia increased coronary flow by about 25%, decreased <re> oxygen <er> saturation level of <el> myoglobin <le> by 23.1-35.7%, without a marked change in left ventricular pressure. Nifedipine (1.0 microgram/ml) increased <re> oxygen <er> saturation level, which had been reduced by hypoxia, by 16-27%. Nifedipine at the concentration of 0.1 microgram/ml also increased the <re> oxygen <er> saturation level of myocardial <el> myoglobin <le> slightly, but at the concentration of 10 micrograms/ml it decreased. Nitroglycerin (100 micrograms/kg) increased the <re> oxygen <er> saturation level, which had been decreased by hypoxia, by 6-8%, whereas dipyridamole (100 micrograms/ml) did not. 
1-Cells from rodents and humans express different receptors recognizing hormones of the secretin-glucagon family, which--when activated--synergize with <re> glucose <er> in the control of insulin release. We have recently reported that isolated islets from mice homozygous for a GLP-1 receptor null mutation (GLP-1R(-/-)) exhibit a well-preserved insulin-secretory response to <re> glucose <er>. This observation can be interpreted in two different ways: 1) the presence of GLP-1R is not essential for the secretory response of isolated islets to <re> glucose <er> alone; 2) beta-cells in GLP-1R(-/-) pancreases underwent compensatory changes in response to the null mutation. To explore these possibilities, we studied islets from control GLP-IR(+/+) mice in the absence or presence of 1 pmol/l exendin (9-39)amide, a specific and potent GLP-1R antagonist. Exendin (9-39)amide (15-min exposure) reduced <re> glucose <er>-induced insulin secretion from both perifused and statically incubated GLP-1R(+/+) islets by 50% (P < 0.05), and reduced islet <el> cAMP <le> production in parallel (P < 0.001). Furthermore, GLP-1R(-/-) islets exhibited: 1) reduced <el> cAMP <le> accumulation in the presence of 20 mmol/l <re> glucose <er> (knockout islets versus control islets, 12 +/- 1 vs. 27 +/- 3 fmol x islet(-1) x 15 min(-1); P < 0.001) and exaggerated acceleration of <el> cAMP <le> production by 10 nmol/l <re> glucose <er>-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) (increase over 20 mmol/l <re> glucose <er> by GIP in knockout islets versus control islets: 66 +/- 5 vs. 14 +/- 3 fmol x islet(-1) x 15 min(-1); P < 0.001); 2) increased mean cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]c) at 7, 10, and 15 mmol/l <re> glucose <er> in knockout islets versus control islets; and 3) signs of asynchrony of [Ca2+]c oscillations between different islet subregions. 
Profound changes in thyroid hormone metabolism occur in the central part of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis during fasting. Hypothalamic changes are partly reversed by <el> leptin <le> administration, which decreases during fasting. It is unknown to what extent <el> leptin <le> affects the HPT axis at the level of the pituitary. We, therefore, studied fasting-induced alterations in pituitary thyroid hormone metabolism, as well as effects of <el> leptin <le> administration on these changes. Because refeeding rapidly increased serum <el> leptin <le>, the same parameters were studied after fasting followed by refeeding. Fasting for 24 h decreased serum T(3) and T(4) and pituitary TSHbeta, type 2deiodinase (D2), and thyroid hormone receptor beta2 (TRbeta2) mRNA expression. The decrease in D2 and <re> TRbeta2 mRNA expression <er> was prevented when 20 mug <el> leptin <le> was administered twice during fasting. By contrast, the decrease in TSHbeta mRNA expression was unaffected. A single dose of <el> leptin <le> given after 24 h fasting did not affect decreased TSHbeta, D2, and <re> TRbeta2 mRNA expression <er>, while 4 h refeeding resulted in pituitary D2 and <re> TRbeta2 mRNA expression <er> as observed in control mice. Serum <el> leptin <le>, T(3), and T(4) after refeeding were similar compared with <el> leptin <le> administration. 
<el> BDNF <le> signaling contributes to protein-synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity, but the dynamics of TrkB signaling and mechanisms of translation have not been defined. Here, we show that long-term potentiation (<re> LTP <er>) consolidation in the dentate gyrus of live rodents requires sustained (hours) <el> BDNF <le>-TrkB signaling. Surprisingly, this sustained activation maintains an otherwise labile signaling pathway from TrkB to MAP-kinase-interacting kinase (MNK). MNK activity promotes eIF4F translation initiation complex formation and protein synthesis in mechanistically distinct early and late stages. In early-stage translation, MNK triggers release of the CYFIP1/FMRP repressor complex from the 5'-mRNA cap. In late-stage translation, MNK regulates the canonical translational repressor 4E-BP2 in a synapse-compartment-specific manner. This late stage is coupled to MNK-dependent enhanced dendritic mRNA translation. 
The effects of two weeks of oral administration of the <el> angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors <le> captopril (a sulphydryl-containing drug) and enalapril (which lacks the sulphydryl group) on skeletal muscle glucose uptake, arterial blood pressure, cardiac <re> hypertrophy <er>, proteinuria and aortic vascular reactivity in obese Zucker rats were evaluated. Captopril (50 mg kg(-1) once daily) and enalapril (10 mg kg(-1) did not modify body weight gain or food or water intake. Both drugs decreased systolic blood pressure (157+/-6, 133+/-4 and 136+/-3 mm Hg, in vehicle-, captopril- and enalapril-treated rats, respectively), blood glucose (172+/-8 vs. 151+/-7 and 158+/-5 mg dl(-1), respectively), proteinuria (46+/-10 vs. 17+/-2 and 18+/-2.5 mg dl(-1), respectively) and heart weight (2.17+/-0.03, 1.98+/-0.02 and 1.99+/-0.04 mg g(-1)of body weight, respectively). Plasma insulin concentration was significantly increased by enalapril (17+/-2 ng ml(-1) vs. 9+/-2) but not by captopril (12+/-1). In the absence of insulin, the diaphragms from captopril- or enalapril-treated rats showed a significantly higher glucose uptake than that of controls (31% and 30% vs. control group, respectively). The presence of insulin in the incubation medium did not stimulate peripheral glucose uptake in the control group but significantly increased glucose uptake in diaphragms from captopril- or enalapril-treated rats (enhancement of glucose uptake vs. control: 52% and 43%, respectively). Endothelium-intact aortic rings from control Zucker rats showed a poor relaxant response to acetylcholine (maximal relaxation of 38.4+/-4.7%). Captopril significantly improved the endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation responses to acetylcholine and the endothelium-independent relaxation to the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside whereas enalapril did not modify these relaxant responses. Neither captopril nor enalapril significantly affected the vascular contractile responses to the vasoconstrictors noradrenaline or KCl. 
Systemic infection activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and brainstem catecholamine cells have been shown to contribute to this response. However, recent work also suggests an important role for the central amygdala (<el> CeA <le>). Because direct connections between the <el> CeA <le> and the hypothalamic apex of the HPA axis are minimal, the present study investigated whether the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) might act as a relay between them. This was done by using an animal model of acute systemic infection involving intravascular delivery of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta, 1 microg/kg). Unilateral ibotenic acid lesions encompassing the ventral BNST significantly reduced both IL-1beta-induced increases in Fos immunoreactivity in corticotropin-releasing factor (<re> CRF <er>) cells of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and corresponding increases in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion. Similar lesions had no effect on <re> CRF <er> cell responses to physical restraint, suggesting that the effects of BNST lesions were not due to a nonspecific effect on stress responses. In further studies, we examined the functional connections between PVN, BNST, and <el> CeA <le> by combining retrograde tracing with mapping of IL-1beta-induced increases in Fos in BNST and <el> CeA <le> cells. In the case of the BNST, these studies showed that systemic IL-1beta administration recruits ventral BNST cells that project directly to the PVN. In the case of the <el> CeA <le>, the results obtained were consistent with an arrangement whereby lateral <el> CeA <le> cells recruited by systemic IL-1beta could regulate the activity of medial <el> CeA <le> cells projecting directly to the BNST. 
<el> Tumor <le>-induced <re> angiogenesis <er> is a prerequisite for excessive tumor growth. Blood vessels invade the tumor tissue after degradation of the extracellular matrix scaffold by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Inhibition of MMPs has been therefore suggested to be a useful tool to abolish neoangiogenesis of solid tumors. In the present study, antioxidative plant ingredients used in traditional Chinese medicine were investigated for their capacity to down-regulate MMP expression and to inhibit <re> angiogenesis <er> in embryonic stem cell-derived embryoid bodies and tumor-induced <re> angiogenesis <er> in confrontation cultures consisting of embryoid bodies and multicellular DU-145 prostate tumor spheroids. Embryoid bodies transiently expressed MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 during the time of differentiation of capillary-like structures. In confrontation cultures, MMP expression was increased compared with control tumor spheroids and embryoid bodies cultivated separately. The increased expression of MMPs in confrontation cultures was a result of elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon confrontation culture and was totally abolished in the presence of the free radical scavenger vitamin E. Incubation of embryoid bodies with baicalein, epicatechin, berberine, and acteoside, which are herbal ingredients used in traditional Chinese medicine, significantly inhibited <re> angiogenesis <er> in embryoid bodies and decreased intracellular ROS levels. 
Interleukin-1 (IL-1) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IL-1 action is regulated in part by its naturally occurring inhibitor, the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). Four splice variants of IL-1Ra gene product have been described, one secreted (sIL-1Ra) and three intracellular (<el> icIL-1Ra1 <le>, 2, 3). Although sIL-1Ra and <el> icIL-1Ra1 <le> bind to type I IL-1 receptor with equal affinity, <el> icIL-1Ra1 <le> may carry out unique functions inside cells. The goal of this study was to determine the role of <el> icIL-1Ra1 <le> in regulation of cytokine-induced <re> IL-6 <er> and IL-8 production in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells. <el> icIL-1Ra1 <le> inhibited IL-1-induced <re> IL-6 <er> and IL-8 production. IL-1 activated all three mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family members: p38 MAP kinase, extracellular-regulated kinases (ERK), and c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK). Specific inhibitors of each MAP kinase pathway decreased IL-1-induced <re> IL-6 <er> and IL-8 production. Overexpression of <el> icIL-1Ra1 <le> inhibited p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation, but had no effect on ERK and JNK phosphorylation. In addition, <el> icIL-1Ra1 <le> inhibited nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB after IL-1 stimulation. 
LncRNAs has been demonstrated to modulate neoplastic development by modulating downstream miRNAs and functional genes. In this study, we aimed to detect the interaction among lncRNA <el> ZFAS1 <le> miR-296-5p and USF1. We explored the proliferation, migration and invasion of cholangiocarcinoma. The differentially expressed <el> ZFAS1 <le> was discovered in both tissues and cell lines by qRT-PCR. The targeting relationship between miR-296-5p and <el> ZFAS1 <le> or USF1 was validated by dual-luciferase assay. The impact of <el> ZFAS1 <le> on CCA cell proliferation was observed by CCK-8 assay. The protein expression of USF1 was determined by Western blot. The effects of <el> ZFAS1 <le>, miR-296-5p and USF1 on tumour growth were further confirmed using xenograft model. LncRNA <el> ZFAS1 <le> expression was relatively up-regulated in tumour tissues and cells while miR-296-5p was significantly down-regulated. Knockdown of <el> ZFAS1 <le> significantly suppressed tumour proliferation, migration, invasion and USF1 expression. Overexpressed miR-296-5p suppressed cell proliferation and <re> metastasis <er>. Knockdown of USF1 inhibited cell proliferation and <re> metastasis <er> and xenograft tumour growth. 
Phasic respiratory bursting in the facial nerve (FN) can be uncoupled from phrenic bursting by application of 9 cmH(2)O positive end-expired pressure (<el> PEEP <le>). This response reflects excitation of expiratory-inspiratory (<re> EI <er>) and preinspiratory (Pre-I) facial neurons during the Pre-I period and inhibition of <re> EI <er> neurons during inspiration (I). Because activation of pulmonary C-fiber (PCF) receptors can inhibit the discharge of <re> EI <er> and Pre-I neurons, we hypothesized that PCF receptor activation via capsaicin would attenuate or abolish uncoupled FN bursting with an increase from 3 cmH(2)O (baseline) to 9 cmH(2)O <el> PEEP <le>. Neurograms were recorded in the FN and phrenic nerve in anesthetized, ventilated, vagally intact adult Wistar rats. Increasing <el> PEEP <le> to 9 cmH(2)O resulted in a persistent rhythmic discharge in the FN during phrenic quiescence (i.e., uncoupled bursting). Combination of <el> PEEP <le> with intrajugular capsaicin injection severely attenuated or eliminated uncoupled bursting in the FN (P < 0.05). Additional experiments examined the pattern of facial motoneuron (vs. neurogram) bursting during <el> PEEP <le> application and capsaicin treatment. These single-fiber recordings confirmed that Pre-I and <re> EI <er> (but not I) neurons continued to burst during <el> PEEP <le>-induced phrenic apnea. Capsaicin treatment during <el> PEEP <le> substantially inhibited Pre-I and <re> EI <er> neuron discharge. Finally, analyses of FN and motoneuron bursting across the respiratory cycle indicated that the inhibitory effects of capsaicin were more pronounced during the Pre-I period. 
We recently reported that extracellular <el> ATP <le> was mitogenic for Swiss 3T3, 3T6, and A431 cells (Huang et al.: Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86:7904-7908, 1989). Here we examined the possible involvement of activation of the protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction pathway in the mechanism of action of extracellular <el> ATP <le>. A potent synergistic stimulation of <re> DNA synthesis <er> in quiescent cultures of 3T3 and 3T6 cells was observed when <el> ATP <le> was presented in combination with growth factors that activate PKC, such as bombesin, vasopressin, or tumor-promoting phorbol esters. This finding suggests that <el> ATP <le> and these mitogens do not act through a common mechanism. In contrast, <el> ATP <le> was unable to show synergism with phorbol esters in A431 cells. We discovered striking differences when we examined the kinetics of formation of diacylglycerol (DAG) stimulated by <el> ATP <le> among these cell lines. Thus, <el> ATP <le> stimulated a sustained biphasic increase of DAG in A431 cells, but only a rapid transient increase of DAG formation was observed in 3T3 and 3T6 cells. The breakdown of phosphatidylcholine was stimulated by <el> ATP <le> in A431 cells; however, a significantly reduced effect was displayed in 3T6 cells. Furthermore, we found that the diacylglycerol-kinase inhibitor, 1-monooleoylglycerol, greatly potentiated <el> ATP <le>-stimulated <re> DNA synthesis <er> in A431 cells. Finally, down-regulation of PKC by long-term exposure to phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu) prevented stimulation of <re> DNA synthesis <er> induced by bombesin, vasopressin, or phorbol esters in 3T3 or 3T6 cells, while it had no such effect on <el> ATP <le>-stimulated mitogenesis in the presence of insulin or epidermal growth factor. On the other hand, PDBu-mediated down-regulation of PKC partially inhibited [3H [thymidine incorporation stimulated by <el> ATP <le> in A431 cells. 
We studied the effect of antiflammin-2 (<el> AF-2 <le>) on <re> adhesion <er> molecule expression by HL-60 cells and endothelial (ECV304) cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), and on leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction in an in vitro coculture system. The action of <el> AF-2 <le> on prostanoid production in these experimental conditions was also tested. LPS increased the <re> adhesion <er> molecule expression, such as lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 and membrane attack complex-1 on HL-60 cells and E-selectin and intercellular <re> adhesion <er> molecule-1 on ECV304 cells. The LPS-stimulated <re> adhesion <er> molecule expression on HL-60/ECV304 coculture system was higher than on HL-60 or ECV304 cultures. LPS also induced HL-60 <re> adhesion <er> to ECV304 monolayer and thromboxane B(2) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production in HL-60 culture and PGE(2) in ECV304 culture. Prostanoid production by HL-60/ECV304 cocultures was higher than by simple cultures. <el> AF-2 <le> inhibited the enhancement of <re> adhesion <er> molecule expression induced by LPSs, especially E-selectin. Thus, <el> AF-2 <le> significantly reduced the HL-60 <re> adhesion <er> to endothelial cells stimulated by LPSs. <el> AF-2 <le> also inhibited prostanoid synthesis by ECV304 cells or HL-60/ECV304 coculture challenged by LPSs. 
Monoclonal gammopathies (MG) are monoclonal proliferative disorders of B cells at the differentiation stage of <re> Ig <er> production. They can be detected in the serum, either as transient or as persistent homogenous immunoglobulin (H-<re> Ig <er>) components. The exact phenotype, localization, and cell lineage origin of the precursor cells of MG are unknown, but may be crucial for both the correct diagnosis and for timely efficient treatment of the malignant forms. We used for the first time transgenic (Tg) mice (Sp6; mu/kappa) to study the origin of MG. In the mu, kappa <el> Tg mice <le> a small proportion of B cells can still produce endogenous <re> Ig <er>M. These cells are of B-1 cell origin. The MG in <el> Tg mice <le> showed a later onset and a lower frequency than those in littermate control mice, mainly due to a four times lower frequency of benign monoclonal gammopathy. The 10% of B-1 cells that were able to produce endogenous <re> Ig <er> led to the development of MG in a frequency that was half the number of MG found in normal littermates. 
Glucose transport in mammalian skeletal muscle is stimulated by insulin, <el> hypoxia <le> and tyrosine protein phosphatase inhibitors such as vanadate. However, it is unknown whether the vanadate signaling mechanism shares a common or separate pathway with insulin or <el> hypoxia <le>. Therefore, experiments were conducted on incubated human muscle strips to compare the effects of vanadate with insulin and <el> hypoxia <le> stimulated 2-deoxyglucose transport (2-DOG). We also used the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) inhibitor wortmannin to examine whether PI 3-kinase is a common step by which each stimulate <re> glucose transport <er>. Results demonstrate that whereas the effects of vanadate and <el> hypoxia <le> were additive with insulin stimulated <re> glucose transport <er>, the effect of vanadate plus <el> hypoxia <le> was not. In addition, wortmannin significantly (P < 0.05) reduced insulin but not vanadate or <el> hypoxia <le> stimulated 2-DOG transport. Moreover, PI 3-kinase activity was significantly elevated (P < 0.05) in the presence of insulin but not vanadate. 
Cadmium (<el> Cd <le>) is a reproductive toxicant that induces germ cell <re> apoptosis <er> in the testes. Previous studies have demonstrated that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is involved in <el> Cd <le>-induced germ cell <re> apoptosis <er>. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, on <el> Cd <le>-induced ER stress and germ cell <re> apoptosis <er> in the testes. Male CD-1 mice were intraperitoneally injected with <el> Cd <le>Cl2 (2.0 mg kg(-1)). As expected, acute <el> Cd <le> exposure induced germ cell <re> apoptosis <er> in the testes, as determined by terminal dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL). However, the administration of NAC alleviated <el> Cd <le>-induced germ cell <re> apoptosis <er> in the testes. Further analysis showed that NAC attenuated the <el> Cd <le>-induced upregulation of testicular glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), an important ER molecular chaperone. Moreover, NAC inhibited the <el> Cd <le>-induced phosphorylation of testicular eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), a downstream target of the double-stranded RNA-activated kinase-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway. In addition, NAC blocked the <el> Cd <le>-induced activation of testicular X binding protein (XBP)-1, indicating that NAC attenuates the <el> Cd <le>-induced ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR). Interestingly, NAC almost completely prevented the <el> Cd <le>-induced elevation of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), two components of the ER stress-mediated apoptotic pathway. 
The inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) has been proposed to be a site of atrial natriuretic factor (<el> ANF <le>) action. We carried out experiments in isolated perfused terminal IMCDs to determine whether <el> ANF <le> (rat <el> ANF <le> 1-28) affects either osmotic water permeability (<re> Pf <er>) or urea permeability. In the presence of a submaximally stimulating concentration of vasopressin (10(-11) M), <el> ANF <le> (100 nM) significantly reduced <re> Pf <er> by an average of 46%. Lower concentrations of <el> ANF <le> also significantly inhibited vasopressin-stimulated <re> Pf <er> by the following percentages: 0.01 nM <el> ANF <le>, 18%; 0.1 nM, 46%; 1 nM, 48%. Addition of exogenous cyclic GMP (0.1 mM) mimicked the effect of <el> ANF <le>, decreasing <re> Pf <er> by an average of 48%. <el> ANF <le> also inhibited cyclic AMP-stimulated <re> Pf <er> by an average of 31%. <el> ANF <le> did not affect urea permeability, nor did it alter vasopressin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation. 
Activation of the renin-angiotensin system exacerbates <re> atrial remodeling <er>, leading to atrial fibrillation and thrombosis, especially in a condition with decreased <el> NO <le> bioavailability. Recently, it has been reported that statins reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation through attenuation of <re> atrial remodeling <er>; however, the mechanisms have not been completely elucidated. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the beneficial effect of statin on <re> atrial remodeling <er> in condition with reduced <el> NO <le> bioavailability. Endothelial <el> NO <le> synthase(-/-) mice were sham operated or infused with angiotensin II (Ang II) via an osmotic minipump for 2 weeks, and Ang II-infused mice were divided into 3 treatment groups: pitavastatin, Tempol (a free radical scavenger), or vehicle. Echocardiography and electrocardiography showed that Ang II infusion caused left atrial enlargement and a high incidence of atrial fibrillation, whereas pitavastatin and Tempol prevented these abnormalities. In histological analysis, Ang II-induced atrial interstitial fibrosis, perivascular fibrosis, and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy were all attenuated by pitavastatin and Tempol. Immunohistochemical staining showed that Ang II downregulated thrombomodulin and tissue factor pathway inhibitor and upregulated tissue factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 in the left atrium and that pitavastatin and Tempol corrected the thrombogenic condition. Moreover, pitavastatin and Tempol reduced Ang II-induced atrial superoxide production and atrial transforming growth factor-beta1 expression and Smad 2/3 phosphorylation. Atrial rac1-GTPase activity, known to activate NADPH oxidase, was attenuated by pitavastatin but not by Tempol. 
Antizyme is a polyamine-induced cellular protein that binds to ornithine decarboxylase (<re> ODC <er>), and targets it to rapid <el> ubiquitin <le>-independent degradation by the 26S proteasome. However, the metabolic fate of antizyme is not clear. We have tested the stability of antizyme in mammalian cells. In contrast with previous studies demonstrating stability in vitro in a reticulocyte lysate-based degradation system, in cells antizyme is rapidly degraded and this degradation is inhibited by specific proteasome inhibitors. While the degradation of <re> ODC <er> is stimulated by the presence of cotransfected antizyme, degradation of antizyme seems to be independent of <re> ODC <er>, suggesting that antizyme degradation does not occur while presenting <re> ODC <er> to the 26S proteasome. Interestingly, both species of antizyme, which represent initiation at two in-frame initiation codons, are rapidly degraded. The degradation of both antizyme proteins is inhibited in ts20 cells containing a thermosensitive <el> ubiquitin <le>-activating enzyme, E1. 
Production of glutamate from glutamine by rat heart mitochondria was stimulated by citrate and ATP in a dose-dependent manner. Citrate required <el> phosphate <le> for manifestation of its stimulatory action, whereas ATP enhanced <re> glutaminase <er> activity with and without <el> phosphate <le>. At low concentrations (1-50 mM) ATP was more potent than citrate, whereas the opposite was true at high (50-150 mM) levels of these anions. Both citrate and ATP decreased the concentration of <el> phosphate <le> required for half-maximal stimulation of glutamate production (EC50) and reduced the value of the Hill coefficient. Phosphate lowered the EC50 for ATP. Chloride and other anions of chaotropic series inhibited glutamine catabolism, most likely by causing depolymerization of the enzyme. Rupture of mitochondrial membranes by freeze-thawing decreased the responsiveness of <re> glutaminase <er> to <el> phosphate <le>, ATP, and especially to citrate but it did not alter the inhibition of the enzyme by chaotropic anions. 
Oxidative stress is thought to play an important role in atherogenesis. The statin group of cholesterol-lowering drugs have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events and possess antioxidant properties. We aimed to assess the effects of <el> simvastatin <le> on a novel measure of prooxidant-antioxidant balance (<re> PAB <er>) in dyslipidemic patients. The <re> PAB <er> assay can measure the prooxidant burden and the antioxidant capacity simultaneously in one assay, thereby giving a redox index. We treated 102 dyslipidemic individuals with <el> simvastatin <le>, or a placebo in a double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial. <re> PAB <er> values were measured before and after each treatment period. Seventy-seven subjects completed the study. We found that statin therapy was associated with a significant reduction in <re> PAB <er> values (P < 0.001). This effect appeared to be independent of the cholesterol-lowering effects of statins. 
We reported recently that the <el> neuropeptides <le> vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) protect CD4+ T cells against Ag-induced apoptosis by down-regulating the expression of Fas ligand (FasL). Because the cytotoxic activity of CD8+ CTLs is mediated through two mechanisms, which involve the perforin/granzyme and the FasL/Fas pathways, in this study we investigated the effects of VIP/PACAP on the generation and activity of allogeneic CTLs, of CD8+ T1 and T2 effector cells and of alloreactive peritoneal exudate cytotoxic T cells (PEL) generated in vivo. VIP/PACAP did not affect perforin/granzyme-mediated cytotoxicity, perforin gene expression, or granzyme B enzymatic activity, but drastically inhibited FasL/Fas-mediated cytotoxicity against allogeneic or syngeneic Fas-bearing targets. VIP/PACAP inhibit CTL generation, but not the activity of competent CTLs. The inhibition is associated with a profound down-regulation of <re> FasL expression <er>, and these effects are mediated through both VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors. VIP/PACAP inhibit the FasL/Fas-mediated cytotoxicity of T1 effectors and do not affect T2 cytotoxicity, which is entirely perforin/granzyme mediated. Similar effects were observed in vivo. Both the FasL/Fas-mediated cytotoxicity and <re> FasL expression <er> of cytotoxic allogeneic PELs generated in vivo in the presence of VIP or PACAP were significantly reduced. 
Drosophila neuroblasts are a model system for studying asymmetric cell division: they divide unequally to produce an apical neuroblast and a basal ganglion mother cell that differ in size, mitotic activity and developmental potential. During neuroblast mitosis, an apical protein complex orients the mitotic spindle and targets determinants of cell fate to the basal cortex, but the mechanism of each process is unknown. Here we show that the tumour-suppressor genes lethal giant larvae (lgl) and discs large (dlg) regulate basal <re> protein targeting <er>, but not apical complex formation or spindle orientation, in both embryonic and larval neuroblasts. Dlg protein is apically enriched and is required for maintaining cortical localization of Lgl protein. Basal <re> protein targeting <er> requires microfilament and <el> myosin <le> function, yet the lgl phenotype is strongly suppressed by reducing levels of <el> myosin <le> II. 
Protein kinase C (PKC) is considered to modulate <el> glucose <le>-stimulated <re> insulin secretion <er>. Pancreatic beta cells express multiple isoforms of PKCs; however, the role of each isoform in <el> glucose <le>-stimulated <re> insulin secretion <er> remains controversial. In this study we investigated the role of PKCdelta, a major isoform expressed in pancreatic beta cells on beta cell function. Here, we showed that PKCdelta null mice manifested <el> glucose <le> intolerance with impaired <re> insulin secretion <er>. Insulin tolerance test showed no decrease in insulin sensitivity in PKCdelta null mice. Studies using islets isolated from these mice demonstrated decreased <el> glucose <le>- and KCl-stimulated <re> insulin secretion <er>. Perifusion studies indicated that mainly the second phase of <re> insulin secretion <er> was decreased. On the other hand, <el> glucose <le>-induced influx of Ca2+ into beta cells was not altered. Immunohistochemistry using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopic analysis showed an increased number of insulin granules close to the plasma membrane in beta cells of PKCdelta null mice. Although PKC is thought to phosphorylate Munc18-1 and facilitate soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptors complex formation, the phosphorylation of Munc18-1 by <el> glucose <le> stimulation was decreased in islets of PKCdelta null mice. 
The present study addresses the question whether tetrameric flavocytochrome b2 in the crystal is catalytically competent and, if so, whether it is possible to prepare a functional complex of the crystalline enzyme with its physiological electron acceptor <re> cytochrome c <er>. By single crystal microspectrophotometry we show that the native reduced enzyme can be oxidized by oxygen or ferricyanide and that the oxidized enzyme can be reduced by the electron donor <el> L-lactate <le>. Reduced <re> cytochrome c <er> appears to diffuse through the liquid channels of flavocytochrome b2 crystals and, at low ionic strength, to accumulate in amounts stoichiometrically equivalent to the enzyme protomers. Both cytochromes can be oxidized by ferricyanide. In the presence of <el> L-lactate <le>, both cytochromes become reduced. 
Levels of tissue advanced glycation end products (<re> AGE <er>s) that result from nonenzymatic reactions of glucose and proteins are high in both diabetic and aging people. Irreversible <re> AGE <er> formation is based on increases in <re> AGE <er>-derived protein-to-protein cross-linking and is considered to be a factor contributing to the complications of diabetes. A novel inhibitor of advanced glycation, OPB-9195, belongs to a group of <el> thiazolidine <le> derivatives, known as hypoglycemic drugs; however, they do not lower blood glucose levels. We did studies to determine if OPB-9195 would prevent the progression of nephropathy in spontaneous diabetic rats. In vitro inhibitory effects of OPB-9195 on <re> AGE <er> formation and <re> AGE <er>-derived cross-linking were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and SDS-PAGE, respectively. Otsuka-Long-Evans-Tokushima-Fatty (OLETF) rats, a model of NIDDM, were used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of OPB-9195. Light microscopic findings by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, the extent of <re> AGE <er> accumulation detected by immunohistochemical staining in the kidneys, the levels of serum <re> AGE <er>s by <re> AGE <er>-specific ELISA, and urinary albumin excretion were examined. OPB-9195 effectively inhibited both <re> AGE <er>-derived cross-linking and the formation of <re> AGE <er>s, in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. In addition, the administration of OPB-9195 prevented the progression of glomerular sclerosis and <re> AGE <er> deposition in glomeruli. Elevation of circulating <re> AGE <er> levels and urinary albumin excretion were dramatically prevented in rats, even at 56 weeks of age and with persistent hyperglycemia. 
Recently, thyroid follicular cells were shown to exhibit atrial natriuretic factor (<el> ANF <le>)-like immunoreactivity and high affinity <el> ANF <le> receptors. In this study, we therefore examined the effects of synthetic rat <el> ANF <le>1-28 on basal and stimulated <re> thyroid hormone secretion <er> in the mouse, according to the McKenzie technique. Iodine deficient mice were pretreated with 125I and thyroxine. <el> ANF <le> (3 nmol/animal) was found to inhibit the increase in blood radioiodine levels that was induced by TSH or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Furthermore, <el> ANF <le> and norepinephrine additively inhibited the TSH-induced increase in blood radioiodine levels. 
The epithelial and epidermal innate cytokines IL-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) have pivotal roles in the initiation of allergic inflammation in <el> asthma <le> and atopic dermatitis (AD). However, the mechanism by which the expression of these innate cytokines is regulated remains unclear. Intelectin (ITLN) is expressed in airway epithelial cells and promotes allergic airway inflammation. We hypothesized that ITLN is required for allergen-induced IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP expression. In two <el> asthma <le> models, Itln knockdown reduced allergen-induced increases in Il-25, Il-33, and <re> Tslp <er> and development of type 2 response, eosinophilic inflammation, mucus overproduction, and airway hyperresponsiveness. Itln knockdown also inhibited house dust mite (HDM)-induced early upregulation of Il-25, Il-33, and <re> Tslp <er> in a model solely inducing airway sensitization. Using human airway epithelial cells, we demonstrated that HDM-induced increases in ITLN led to phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor and extracellular-signal regulated kinase, which were required for induction of IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP expression. In two AD models, Itln knockdown suppressed expression of Il-33, <re> Tslp <er>, and Th2 cytokines and eosinophilic inflammation. In humans, ITLN1 expression was significantly increased in <el> asthma <le>tic airways and in lesional skin of AD. 
1. The effect of a respiratory <el> acidosis <le> on the interval-force relation and on mechanical restitution was investigated in ferret papillary muscles. 2. Acidosis (pH 6.85) decreased developed force over a range of stimulation frequencies (1.0.06 Hz); the percentage decrease was greatest at the lowest stimulation frequencies. Qualitatively similar effects of <el> acidosis <le> on developed force were observed in the presence of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (<re> SR <er>) inhibitor ryanodine. 3. Mechanical restitution curves were constructed by interpolating extra-systoles at different test intervals following a train of steady-state beats. Mechanical restitution in ferret papillary muscle was triphasic: an initial, rapid, exponential increase in force with test intervals to 2 s, a further increase with test intervals between 60 and 90 s and then a slow decline, with a plateau at about 30 min (0.33 Hz, 30 degrees C). 4. Acidosis slowed the initial phase of mechanical restitution. The degree of slowing depended on the steady-state stimulation frequency, being greatest at low frequencies. 5. Inhibition of the <re> SR <er> abolished the initial phase of mechanical restitution, suggesting that this phase depends on Ca2+ release from the <re> SR <er>. 6. The strength of the first contraction after the extra-systole varied inversely with the size of the extra-systole under all conditions studied. 7. 
The <el> AMPD2 <le> gene, a member of the AMPD gene family encoding AMP deaminase, is widely expressed in nonmuscle tissues including kidney, although its functions have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we studied the function of the <el> AMPD2 <le> gene by establishing <el> AMPD2 <le>-deficient model animal. We established <el> AMPD2 <le> knockout mice by using gene transfer and homologous recombination in murine ES cells and studied phenotypes and functions in the kidneys of these animals. AMPD activity was decreased from 22.9 mIU/mg protein to 2.5 mIU/mg protein in the kidneys of AMPD knockout mice. In addition to changes in <re> nucleotide metabolism <er> in the kidneys, proteinuria was found in 3-week-old <el> AMPD2 <le> knockout mice, followed by a further increment up to a peak level at 6 weeks old (up to 0.6 g/dL). The major protein component in the urine of <el> AMPD2 <le> knockout mice was found to be albumin, indicating that <el> AMPD2 <le> may have a key role in glomerular filtration. Indeed, an ultrastructure study of glomerulus specimens from these mice showed effacement of the podocyte foot processes, resembling minimal-change nephropathy in humans. 
The PTH receptor (PTH1R) activates multiple signaling pathways, including extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (<el> ERK <le>1/2). The role of epidermal growth factor receptor (<re> EGFR <er>) transactivation in <el> ERK <le>1/2 activation by PTH in distal kidney cells, a primary site of PTH action, was characterized. <el> ERK <le>1/2 phosphorylation was stimulated by PTH and blocked by the <re> EGFR <er> inhibitor, AG1478. Upon PTH stimulation, metalloprotease cleavage of membrane-bound heparin-binding fragment (HB-EGF) induced <re> EGFR <er> transactivation of <el> ERK <le>. Conditioned media from PTH-treated distal kidney cells activated <el> ERK <le> in HEK-293 cells. AG1478 added to HEK-293 cells ablated transactivation by conditioned media. HB-EGF directly activated <el> ERK <le>1/2 in HEK-293 cells. Pretreatment of distal kidney cells with the metalloprotease inhibitor GM-6001 abolished transactivation of <el> ERK <le>1/2 by PTH. The role of the PTH1R COOH terminus in PTX-sensitive <el> ERK <le>1/2 activation was characterized in HEK-293 cells transfected with wild-type PTH1R, with a PTH1R mutated at its COOH terminus, or with PTH1R truncated at position 480. PTH stimulated <el> ERK <le> by wild-type, mutated and truncated PTH1Rs 21-, 27- and 57-fold, respectively. Thus, the PTH1R COOH terminus exerts an inhibitory effect on <el> ERK <le> activation. EBP50, a scaffolding protein that binds to the PDZ recognition domain of the PTH1R, impaired PTH but not isoproterenol or calcitonin-induced <el> ERK <le> activation. Pertussis toxin inhibited PTH-stimulated <el> ERK <le>1/2 by mutated and truncated PTH1Rs and abolished <el> ERK <le>1/2 activation by wild-type PTH1R. 
Tissue glucose uptake occurs by <re> insulin <er>-dependent and <re> insulin <er>-independent mechanisms. To evaluate the effect of mild <el> hyperglycemia <le> and hyperinsulinemia on the parameters responsible for glucose disposal, glucose (1.17 mmol/min) or saline was infused into six healthy male subjects (age 25-38 yr, body mass index 22.1-26.3 kg/m2) for 24 h. Thereafter, while the infusion continued, indexes of <re> insulin <er> sensitivity (SI), glucose effectiveness at basal <re> insulin <er> (SG), basal <re> insulin <er> effect (BIE = SI x basal <re> insulin <er>), and glucose effectiveness at zero <re> insulin <er> (GEZI = SG - BIE) were measured using Bergman's minimal model of <re> insulin <er> action. GEZI provides a measure of the efficiency of glucose to accelerate its own disposal independent of <re> insulin <er>. Twenty-four hours of glucose infusion increased the basal plasma glucose (5.1 +/- 0.1 to 6.4 +/- 0.2 mM, P = 0.001) and <re> insulin <er> (79 +/- 8 to 174 +/- 31 pM, P less than 0.05) levels. Hyperglycemia was also associated with an increase in the <re> insulin <er> response, predominantly in the second-phase component (138 +/- 31 to 258 +/- 66 pM, P less than 0.05). SI (4.8 +/- 1.0 to 8.2 +/- 1.6 x 10(-5) min-1.pM-1, P less than 0.05) and SG (1.7 +/- 0.1 to 2.5 +/- 0.3 x 10(-2) min-1, P less than 0.05) both increased after glucose infusion. The increase in SG was entirely due to the combined increase in basal <re> insulin <er> and <re> insulin <er> sensitivity (BIE 0.4 +/- 0.1 to 1.2 +/- 0.1 x 10(-2) min-1, P = 0.001) since GEZI did not change at all (1.3 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.3 x 10(-2) min-1, P = not significant). 
Increasing evidence indicates that pulmonary arterial hypertension is a vascular inflammatory disease. Prostacyclin (PGI(2)) is widely used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension and is believed to benefit patients largely through vasodilatory effects. PGI(2) is also increasingly believed to have anti-inflammatory effects, including decreasing leukocyte <el> cytokine production <le>, yet few mechanistic details exist to explain how these effects are mediated at the transcriptional level. Because activated monocytes are critical sources of MCP-1 and other cytokines in cardiovascular inflammation, we examined the effects of iloprost on IFN-gamma- and IL-6-stimulated <el> cytokine production <le> in human monocytes. We found that iloprost inhibited IFN-gamma- and IL-6-induced MCP-1, IL-8, RANTES, and TNF-alpha production in monocytes, indicating wide-ranging anti-inflammatory action. We found that activation of STAT1 was critical for IFN-gamma-induced MCP-1 production and demonstrated that iloprost inhibited STAT1 activation by several actions as follows: 1) iloprost inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT1-S727 in the transactivation domain, thereby reducing recruitment of the <re> histone <er> acetylase and coactivator CBP/p300 to STAT1; 2) iloprost selectively inhibited activation of JAK2 but not JAK1, both responsible for activation of STAT1 via phosphorylation of STAT1-Y701, resulting in reduced nuclear recruitment and activation of STAT1; and 3) SOCS-1, which normally terminates IFN-gamma-signaling, was not involved in iloprost-mediated inhibition of STAT1, indicating divergence from the classical pathway for terminating IFN-gamma-signaling. 
The combined depressant effects of <re> verapamil <er> and <el> halothane <le> on myocardial contractility were studied using isolated papillary muscle from the rabbit. Verapamil alone (0.5 microM) significantly decreased peak developed tension (PDT) by 15 +/- 2%, time to peak tension (TPT) by 10 +/- 1%, and maximum rate of increase of tension (+dT/dt) by 5 +/- 1%, but not maximum rate of decrease of tension (-dT/dt). Halothane alone (0.8%) significantly decreased PDT by 56 +/- 2%, TPT by 11 +/- 2%, +dT/dt by 53 +/- 2%, and -dT/dt by 56 +/- 2%. During the exposure period, the combination of <re> verapamil <er> and <el> halothane <le> together produced a simple additive effect (no significant interaction effect by two-way analysis of variance), with PDT decreased by 68 +/- 2%, TPT by 20 +/- 3%, +dT/dt by 62 +/- 2%, and -dT/dt by 65 +/- 2%. The reversibility of <el> halothane <le>-induced depression was also studied. Peak developed tension showed complete reversibility 30 min after discontinuing <el> halothane <le>. In the presence of <re> verapamil <er>, however, the reversibility of <el> halothane <le>-induced depression was not complete, and significant residual depression of PDT (19 +/- 3%) was observed. 
Plant protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are important in regulating cellular responses to redox change through their reversible inactivation under oxidative conditions. Studies on the soybean (Glycine max) <re> GmPTP <er> have shown that, compared with its mammalian counterparts, the plant enzyme is relatively insensitive to inactivation by H2O2 but hypersensitive (k(inact) = 559 M(-1) s(-1)) to S-glutathionylation (thiolation) promoted by the presence of oxidized glutathione (<el> GSSG <le>). Through a combination of chemical and mutational modification studies, three of the seven cysteine residues of <re> GmPTP <er> have been identified by mass spectrometry as being able to inactivate the enzyme when thiolated by <el> GSSG <le> or alkylated with iodoacetamide. Conserved Cys 266 was shown to be essential for catalysis but surprisingly resistant to S-modification, whereas the regulatory Cys 78 and Cys 176 were readily thiolated and/or alkylated. Mutagenesis of these cysteines showed that all three residues were in proximity of each other, regulating each's reactivity to S-modifying agents. 
The virus safety of blood derivatives continues to be of concern, especially with respect to nonenveloped and/or heat-stable viruses. Previously, we demonstrated that treatment of whole plasma, AHF concentrate or fibrinogen with short wavelength ultraviolet light (UVC) results in the inactivation of > or = 10(6) infectious doses (<re> ID <er>) of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), hepatitis A virus (HAV) and porcine parvovirus (PPV), each of which is nonenveloped. Protein recovery was enhanced greatly by inclusion of the flavonoid, rutin, added prior to UVC exposure to quench reactive oxygen species. We now report on the treatment of <el> albumin <le> and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) isolated by a previously described, integrated chromatographic method. Albumin was treated with either 0.1 or 0.2 J/cm2 UVC in the presence of 0.8 or 1.6 mM rutin; IVIG was treated with either 0.05 or 0.1 J/cm2 UVC in the presence of 0.5 or 1.0 mM rutin. Our results show that > or = 10(6.9) <re> ID <er> of EMCV and PPV were inactivated under each of the conditions studied except the treatment of <el> albumin <le> with 0.1 J/cm2 UVC in the presence of 1.6 mM rutin where 10(4.3) <re> ID <er> of EMCV and > or = 10(6.9) <re> ID <er> of PPV were killed. It appears that the sensitivity of PPV to UVC exceeds that of EMCV and that virus kill with UVC is higher in IVIG than in <el> albumin <le>. In the absence of rutin, UVC increased the extent of aggregation of both <el> albumin <le> and IVIG by two- to three-fold. With rutin present, the increase in <el> albumin <le> aggregation was reduced, and it was virtually eliminated by subsequent processing on Sephacryl S-200, a step in the existing procedure designed to remove aggregates. The increase in aggregation of IVIG appeared to be eliminated on inclusion of either 0.5 mM or 1 mM rutin. 
Cardiac remodeling involves the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins including fibronectin (FN). FN contains RGD motifs that bind integrins at DDX sequences allowing signaling from the ECM to the nucleus. We noted that the natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPR-A) sequence contains both RGD and DDX sequences. The goal of the current investigation was to determine potential interactions between FN and NPR-A on <el> BNP <le> induction of <re> cGMP <er> in cultured human cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). Further, we sought to determine whether a Mayo designed NPR-A specific RGD peptide could modify this interaction. Here we reconfirm the presence of all three natriuretic peptide receptors (NPR) in CFs. CFs plated on FN demonstrated a pronounced increase in <re> cGMP <er> production to <el> BNP <le> compared to non-coated plates. This production was also enhanced by the NPR-A specific RGD peptide, which further augmented FN associated <re> cGMP <er> production. Addition of HS-142-1, a NPR-A/B antagonist, abrogated the responses of <el> BNP <le> to both FN and the NPR-A specific RGD peptide. Finally, we defined a possible role for the NPR-C through non-<re> cGMP <er> mechanisms in mediating the anti-proliferative actions of <el> BNP <le> in CFs where the NPR-C antagonist cANF 4-28 but not HS-142-1 blocked <el> BNP <le>-mediated inhibition of proliferation of CFs. 
The effects of lithium (<el> Li <le>) on the kidney were studied in normal Long Evans (LE) rats and in rats of the Brattleboro strain (DI rats) which have a congenital (hypothalamic) diabetes insipidus. The rats received a moderate daily oral dose of <el> Li <le> for 4 weeks. The renal cortex of untreated DI rats showed no changes compared with LE rats, but in their medullary collecting ducts (CD) the cells appeared more voluminous, and by light microscope morphometry (outer medulla) their volume fraction was increased. Furthermore, there was an increase in the enzyme histochemical activities of succinate and alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenases, most pronounced in the inner medullary zone. <el> Li <le>-treated LE rats and DI rats both showed the same degree of cortical and medullary changes. In the cortex, the light microscope and enzyme histochemical changes were confined to the connecting tubules (CNT) and CD. In the outer and inner medullary zones the increase in CD volume fraction and enzyme activity was much more pronounced than in untreated DI rats. Morphometry of the inner stripe of the outer medullary zone showed the same decrease in the volume fraction of the distal straight tubules (<re> DST <er>) in DI rats with and without <el> Li <le> treatment, as well as in <el> Li <le>-treated LE rats compared with normal LE rats. This decrease may be due to the lack of vasopressin-mediated cyclic AMP generation in the <re> DST <er> of these three groups of animals. 
Steady-state levels of mRNAs that encode specific Fc gamma R and Ia antigen genes have been measured in macrophages treated with interferons (IFNs) to examine the induction of these markers at the molecular level. Our previous studies suggested requirement for protein kinase C (PKC) in the IFN induction of these macrophage surface markers, although a difference in PKC dependence was found between IFN-alpha/beta- and <el> IFN-gamma <le>-induced Fc gamma R expression. The protein kinase antagonist H7, used previously to distinguish between the surface induction of Fc gamma R by IFN-alpha/beta and <el> IFN-gamma <le>, also distinguishes between the IFN-alpha and <el> IFN-gamma <le> in the induction of Fc gamma <re> RI <er> mRNA and Fc gamma <re> RI <er> surface expression. Protein kinase inhibitors blocked the <el> IFN-gamma <le> induction of Ia mRNA in a manner similar to that reported previously for cell surface Ia expression. 
Atypical PKC (ι/λ and ζ; hereafter referred to as aPKC) is a key player in the acquisition of epithelial polarity and participates in other signaling cascades including the control of NF-κB signaling. This kinase is post-translationally regulated through <re> Hsp70 <er>-mediated refolding. Previous work has shown that such a chaperoning activity is specifically localized to keratin intermediate filaments. Our work was performed with the goal of identifying the molecule(s) that block <re> Hsp70 <er> activity on keratin filaments during inflammation. A transcriptional screen allowed us to focus on BAG-1, a multi-functional protein that assists <re> Hsp70 <er> in nucleotide exchange but also blocks its activity at higher concentrations. We found the BAG-1 isoform <el> BAG-1M <le> upregulated threefold in human Caco-2 cells following stimulation with tumor necrosis factor receptor α (TNFα) to induce a pro-inflammatory response, and up to sixfold in mouse enterocytes following treatment with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce colitis. <el> BAG-1M <le>, but no other isoform, was found to co-purify with intermediate filaments and block <re> Hsp70 <er> activity in the keratin fraction but not in the soluble fraction within the range of concentrations found in epithelial cells cultured under control and inflammation conditions. Constitutive expression of <el> BAG-1M <le> decreased levels of phosphorylated aPKC. By contrast, knockdown of BAG-1, blocked the TNFα-induced decrease of phosphorylated aPKC. 
Intracellular cGMP is an important second messenger in endothelial cells. Because Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels with large conductance (<el> BK <le>(Ca)) have been shown to regulate endothelial cell functions, the aim of the present study was to examine whether <re> sildenafil <er> modulates <el> BK <le>(Ca) activity in cultured human endothelial cells. Changes of the endothelial cell membrane potential were analyzed using the fluorescence dye DiBAC. The patch-clamp technique was used to study <el> BK <le>(Ca) in human endothelial cells of umbilical cord veins (HUVEC). Intracellular Ca(2+) levels were analyzed using Fura-2 fluorescence imaging. Sildenafil caused a dose-dependent (0.05-5 micromol/l) hyperpolarization of the endothelial cells with a maximum at a concentration of 1 micromol/l. A significant increase of <el> BK <le>(Ca) activity was induced by <re> sildenafil <er> (1 micromol/l) perfusion. <el> BK <le>(Ca) open state-probability (NPo) was also increased by the cGMP-analogue 8-bromo-cGMP (0.5 mmol/l), whereas inhibition of the cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG) had no effect on NPo. PKG-inhibition abolished 8-bromo-cGMP induced <el> BK <le>(Ca) activation, and reduced <re> sildenafil <er> induced NPo. Furthermore, <re> sildenafil <er> caused a significant increase of intracellular calcium that was blocked by the <el> BK <le>(Ca) inhibitor iberiotoxin (100 nmol/l). 
The aim of the present study was to verify whether overexpression of CXC receptor 4 (<el> CXCR4 <le>) promotes the invasion and migration of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) via epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9), and to detect the association between <el> CXCR4 <le>, EGFR and MMP-9. The effects of overexpression of <el> CXCR4 <le> on lung cancer cell functions were investigated by migration and invasion assays. Western blotting and zymograph assays were used to analyze the protein expression levels of EGFR and the production of MMP-9, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was applied to analyze the expression of EGFR, <el> CXCR4 <le> and MMP-9 in NSCLC. Statistical analyses were used to detect the associations among EGFR, <el> CXCR4 <le> and MMP-9 in NSCLC. Finally, survival analyses were performed. <el> CXCR4 <le> overexpression enhanced <re> cell motility <er> and invasion. <el> CXCR4 <le> also promoted expression of EGFR and elevated MMP-9 production. <el> CXCR4 <le>, EGFR and MMP-9 were highly expressed in NSCLC, and were not identified as associated with age and sex (P>0.05). However, they were associated with tumor differentiation and lymph node metastasis (P<0.05). <el> CXCR4 <le>, EGFR and <el> CXCR4 <le> expression were positively associated with one another in NSCLC (P<0.05). In addition, patients with positive expression of <el> CXCR4 <le>, EGFR or MMP-9 in tumors exhibited significantly shorter overall survival compared with those with negative expression (P<0.05). 
Intermittent PTH increases trabecular bone mass in vivo by stimulating osteoblast differentiation to increase bone formation. The molecular events that mediate the anabolic effect of PTH on osteoblasts have not been characterized. We investigated if PTH regulated mRNA expression of proto-oncogenes, c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc, early response genes that have been shown to be involved in the regulation of both <re> cell proliferation <er> and differentiation. As PTH also regulates the early expression of the cytokine, interleukin-6 (<el> IL-6 <le>), in bone cells in vitro, we also investigated if this occurred in vivo, in concert with the other early response genes. Northern blot hybridization was used to analyze mRNA expression in the metaphysis of the distal femur of young rats. To determine the proliferative state in these femurs, mRNA expression of the <re> cell proliferation <er> marker histone, H4, was assessed. Subcutaneous administration of a single injection of human PTH (1-34) at 8 micrograms/100 g, a dose known to increase bone forming surfaces, induced rapid and transient expression of c-fos, c-jun, c-myc, and <el> IL-6 <le> mRNA. A second novel transcript for <el> IL-6 <le> was detected, but its significance remains unknown. Induction of all these messages was evident by 1 h; the levels of mRNA returned to baseline after 3-6 h. Concurrently, PTH had a small inhibitory effect on the expression of histone H4 mRNA. 
Previous studies suggest that salicylic acid (<el> SA <le>) plays an important role in influencing plant resistance to ozone (<re> O3 <er>). To further define the role of <el> SA <le> in <re> O3 <er>-induced responses, we compared the responses of two Arabidopsis genotypes that accumulate different amounts of <el> SA <le> in response to <re> O3 <er> and a <el> SA <le>-deficient transgenic Col-0 line expressing salicylate hydroxylase (NahG). The differences observed in <re> O3 <er>-induced changes in <el> SA <le> levels, the accumulation of active oxygen species, defense gene expression, and the kinetics and severity of lesion formation indicate that <el> SA <le> influences <re> O3 <er> tolerance via two distinct mechanisms. Detailed analyses indicated that features associated with a hypersensitive response (HR) were significantly greater in <re> O3 <er>-exposed Cvi-0 than in Col-0, and that NahG plants failed to exhibit these HR-like responses. Furthermore, <re> O3 <er>-induced antioxidant defenses, including the redox state of glutathione, were greatly reduced in NahG plants compared to Col-0 and Cvi-0. This suggests that <re> O3 <er>-induced cell death in NahG plants is due to the loss of <el> SA <le>-mediated potentiation of antioxidant defenses, while <re> O3 <er>-induced cell death in Cvi-0 is due to activation of a HR. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that inhibition of NADPH-oxidases reduced <re> O3 <er>-induced H2O2 levels and the <re> O3 <er>-induced cell death in Cvi-0, while no major changes were observed in NahG plants. 
We have evaluated the effects of different anti-coagulants or agonists on the generation of platelet-derived microparticles (<re> PMP <er>s) using flow cytometry. Twenty microg/ml of collagen induced significantly greater <re> PMP <er> formation in whole blood anti-coagulated with argatroban, a selective thrombin inhibitor, as compared with platelet-rich plasma, or whole blood anti-coagulated with citrate. Thus, whole blood kept at the physiological Ca2+ concentration provides an optimal condition for the formation of <re> PMP <er>. Convulxin, a GPVI-selective agonist, also induced <re> PMP <er> formation at the magnitude which far exceeds those of other agonists, such as thrombin receptor-activating peptide, <el> ADP <le> or epinephrine. These findings suggest that GPVI-mediated platelet activation plays a key role in the formation of <re> PMP <er> in the presence of physiological Ca2+ in whole blood. The addition of red blood cells to PRP potentiated <re> PMP <er> formation induced by collagen. Pretreatment of whole blood with the combination of creatine phosphate and creatine phosphokinase reduced <re> PMP <er> formation induced by collagen. Blockade of <el> ADP <le> receptors, P2Y12 with AR-C69931MX and P2Y1 with A3P5P, respectively, further suppressed collagen-induced <re> PMP <er> formation. 
Glucokinase (GK) catalyzes the phosphorylation of <el> glucose <le> in beta-cells and hepatocytes, and mutations in the GK gene have been implicated in a form of human diabetes. To investigate the relative role of partial deficiencies in the hepatic vs. pancreatic GK activity, we examined <re> insulin secretion <er>, <el> glucose <le> disposal, and hepatic <el> glucose <le> production (HGP) in response to hyperglycemia in transgenic mice 1) with one disrupted GK allele, which manifest decreased GK activity in both liver and beta-cells (GK+/-), and 2) with decreased GK activity selectively in beta-cells (RIP-GKRZ). Liver GK activity was decreased by 35-50% in the GK+/- but not in the RIP-GKRZ compared with wild type (WT) mice. Hyperglycemic clamp studies were performed in conscious mice with or without concomitant pancreatic clamp. In all studies [3-(3)H]<el> glucose <le> was infused to measure the rate of appearance of <el> glucose <le> and HGP during 80 min of euglycemia (Glc approximately 5 mM) followed by 90 min of hyperglycemia (Glc approximately 17 mM). During hyperglycemic clamp studies, steady-state plasma insulin concentration, rate of <el> glucose <le> infusion, and rate of <el> glucose <le> disappearance (Rd) were decreased in both GK+/- and RIP-GKRZ compared with WT mice. However, whereas the basal HGP (at euglycemia) averaged approximately 22 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1) in all groups, during hyperglycemia HGP was suppressed by only 48% in GK+/- compared with approximately 70 and 65% in the WT and RIP-GKRZ mice, respectively. During the pancreatic clamp studies, the ability of hyperglycemia per se to increase Rd was similar in all groups. However, hyperglycemia inhibited HGP by only 12% in GK+/-, vs. 42 and 45%, respectively, in the WT and RIP-GKRZ mice. 
Vitamin D is an important regulator of the expression of antimicrobial peptides, and vitamin D deficiency is associated with respiratory infections. Regulating expression of antimicrobial peptides, such as the human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide 18 (hCAP18)/LL-37, by vitamin D in bronchial epithelial cells requires local conversion of 25(OH)-vitamin D(3) (25D(3)) into its bioactive metabolite, 1,25(OH)(2)-vitamin D(3) (1,25D(3)), by CYP27B1. Low circulating vitamin D levels in childhood asthma are associated with more-severe exacerbations, which are often associated with infections. Atopic asthma is accompanied by Th2-driven inflammation mediated by cytokines such as interleukin 4 (IL-4) and <el> IL-13 <le>, and the effect of these cytokines on vitamin D metabolism and hCAP18/<re> LL-37 expression <er> is unknown. Therefore, we investigated this with well-differentiated bronchial epithelial cells. To this end, cells were treated with <el> IL-13 <le> with and without 25D(3), and expression of hCAP18/LL-37, CYP27B1, the 1,25D(3)-inactivating enzyme CYP24A1, and vitamin D receptor was assessed by quantitative PCR. We show that <el> IL-13 <le> enhances the ability of 25D(3) to increase expression of hCAP18/LL-37 and CYP24A1. In addition, exposure to <el> IL-13 <le> resulted in increased CYP27B1 expression, whereas vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression was not significantly affected. The enhancing effect of <el> IL-13 <le> on 25D(3)-mediated expression of hCAP18/LL-37 was further confirmed using SDS-PAGE Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. 
The distribution and the functional significance of angiotensin-II (ANG-II) receptor subtypes, <el> AT1 <le> and AT2, in the rat adrenal gland has been investigated in vitro. Autoradiographic assessment of the selective displacement of [125I]ANG-II binding by selective ligands of the two receptor subtypes indicated that zona glomerulosa (ZG) was provided with both <el> AT1 <le> and AT2, and adrenal medulla (AM) almost exclusively with AT2 receptors. ANG-II (10(-9) M) evoked a marked rise in the secretion of <re> aldosterone <er> by dispersed ZG cells and catecholamines by AM fragments. The selective <el> AT1 <le>-receptor antagonist DuP753 blocked <re> aldosterone <er> response to ANG-II, while the selective AT2-receptor antagonist PD123319 was ineffective. Catecholamine response to ANG-II was inhibited by PD123319 and only moderately affected by high concentrations of DuP753. The selective AT2-receptor agonist CGP42112 did not change basal <re> aldosterone <er> release of ZG cells, but concentration-dependently enhanced basal catecholamine release by AM fragments. 
Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants can facilitate surgery and anaesthesia in numerous species. and volatile inhalational anaesthetics such as <el> isoflurane <le> potentiate their action. We studied the effect of <el> isoflurane <le> on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of <re> metocurine <er> in six goats. Each was studied twice: once during barbiturate-opiate anaesthesia and once during <el> isoflurane <le> anaesthesia. The evoked response to sciatic nerve stimulation was measured using a force transducer attached to the hoof. Metocurine was infused until approximately 80-90% blockade. Plasma <re> metocurine <er> concentration was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Isoflurane increased the potency of <re> metocurine <er> significantly; IC50 (the concentration in the effect compartment at 50% paralysis) was 70 +/- 15 ng/mL during <el> isoflurane <le> anaesthesia and 129 +/- 42 ng/mL during barbiturate-opiate anaesthesia (P < 0.03). Volume of distribution (63 +/- 18 mL/kg), clearance (1.6 +/- 0.4 mL/min.kg) and elimination half-life (99 +/- 9 min) during barbiturate-opiate anaesthesia were not significantly different during <el> isoflurane <le> anaesthesia: 64 +/- 25 mL/kg, 1.5 +/- 0.7 mL/kg.min, 116 +/- 16 min respectively. 
Non-metabolized <el> glucose <le> derivatives may cause inactivation of phosphorylase but, unlike <el> glucose <le>, they are unable to elicit activation of glycogen synthase in isolated hepatocytes. We report here that, after the previous inactivation of phosphorylase by one of these <el> glucose <le> derivatives (2-deoxy-2-fluoro-alpha-glucosyl fluoride), glycogen synthase was progressively activated by addition of increasing concentrations of <el> glucose <le>. Under these conditions, the degree of activation of glycogen synthase was linearly correlated with the intracellular <el> glucose <le>-6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) concentration. Addition of glucosamine, an inhibitor of glucokinase, decreased both parameters in parallel. Further experiments using an inhibitor of either protein kinases (5-iodotubercidin) or protein <re> phosphatase <er>s (microcystin) in isolated hepatocytes indicated that Glc-6-P does not affect glycogen-synthase kinase activity but enhances the glycogen-synthase <re> phosphatase <er> reaction. Experiments in vitro showed that the synthase <re> phosphatase <er> activity of glycogen-bound type-1 protein <re> phosphatase <er> was increased by physiological concentrations of Glc-6-P (0.1-0.5 mM), but not by 2.5 mM fructose-6-P, fructose-1-P or <el> glucose <le>-1-P. At physiological ionic strength, the glycogen-associated synthase <re> phosphatase <er> activity was nearly entirely Glc-6-P-dependent, but Glc-6-P did not relieve the strong inhibitory effect of phosphorylase a. 
Xanthohumol (XN) is a prenylated chalcone-type flavonoid found in hops and beer. Our objective of this study was to determine the anti-inflammatory activities of XN, isoxanthohumol (IX), and 15 related prenylated chalcones and flavanones, as well as their structure-activity relationships. The anti-inflammatory activities of the flavonoids were measured by their ability to inhibit lipopolysaccharide (<el> LPS <le>)-induced cytokine production in human monocytic THP-1 cells. The position, number, and length of the prenyl groups had a marked influence on the inhibitory activity of the prenylfavonoids towards MCP-1 and IL-6 production. The α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety present in chalcones such as XN was not an absolute requirement for inhibitory activity, as the saturated XN derivative, tetrahydroxanthohumol (TX), showed inhibitory activity comparable to XN. With the aim to determine the mechanism of the observed anti-inflammatory effects, cellular protein levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (<re> TLR4 <er>) were measured by Western blot 24 h following coexposure of THP-1 cells to <el> LPS <le> and either XN, TX, or IX. Only XN reduced the cellular <re> TLR4 <er> protein content. Therefore, an additional hypothesis was developed for an anti-inflammatory mechanism that involves the <re> TLR4 <er> coreceptor myeloid differentiation protein-2 (MD-2), which provides the actual binding site for <el> LPS <le>. Molecular docking studies showed that the complementarity of prenylated flavonoids with the hydrophobic MD-2 pocket (indicating goodness of fit) directly predicted their relative ability to inhibit MCP-1 and IL-6 production. 
GH secretagogues (GHS) possess potent GH-releasing activity but also stimulate PRL, <re> ACTH <er> and cortisol (F) secretion. To further clarify the endocrine activities of GHS, in 9 obese patients, 9 patients with Cushing's disease and 14 controls we studied the <re> ACTH <er>, F, GH and PRL responses to hexarelin (HEX, 2.0 micrograms/kg i.v.), a peptidyl GHS, alone and preceeded by <el> alprazolam <le> (ALP, 0.02 mg/kg p.o.), a benzodiazepine. The HEX-induced <re> ACTH <er> response in controls was similar to that in obese patients (delta peak: 9.9 +/- 1.9 and 24.7 +/- 7.6 ng/L, respectively) and both were lower (p < 0.002) than that in Cushing's patients (peak: 210.7 +/- 58.4 ng/L). The GH response to HEX in controls (peak: 58.1 +/- 10.3 x g/L) was higher (p < 0.001) than those in obese and Cushing's patients (18.2 +/- 3.8 and 12.6 +/- 5.4 x g/L, respectively) which, in turn, were similar. The PRL responses to HEX in controls, obese and Cushing's patients (peak: 11.9 +/- 1.6, 18.0 +/- 4.5 and 12.4 +/- 1.4 x g/L, respectively) were similar. In controls the HEX-induced <re> ACTH <er> response was abolished by ALP (peak: 8.6 +/- 2.4 vs 28.0 +/- 6.7 ng/L, p < 0.03) which, on the other hand, only blunted that in obese (peak: 12.7 +/- 2.1 vs 42.4 +/- 8.4 ng/L, p < 0.02) and did not modify that in Cushing's patients (205.6 +/- 55.4 vs 175.9 +/- 47.6 ng/L). ALP blunted the GH response to HEX in controls (peak: 31.0 +/- 7.1 x g/L, p < 0.03) while did not modify those in obese and in Cushing's patients (14.5 +/- 5.3 and 13.3 +/- 11.1 x g/L, respectively). ALP did not modify the HEX-induced PRL response in controls, obese and Cushing's patients (peak: 13.8 +/- 0.9, 16.3 +/- 2.4 and 19.2 +/- 1.1 x g/L, respectively). 
Previous studies have suggested that Klotho provides reno-protection against unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)-induced renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis (RTF). Because the existing studies are mainly performed using heterozygous Klotho mutant (HT) mice, we focused on the effect of UUO on homozygous Klotho mutant (kl/kl) mice. UUO kidneys from HT mice showed a significantly higher level of RTF and <re> TGF-β <er>/Smad3 signaling than wild-type (WT) mice, whereas both were greatly suppressed in kl/kl mice. Primary proximal tubular epithelial culture cells isolated from kl/kl mice showed no suppression in <re> TGF-β <er>1-induced epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) compared to those from HT mice. In the renal epithelial cell line NRK52E, a large amount of inorganic phosphate (Pi), FGF23, or calcitriol was added to the medium to mimic the in vivo homeostasis of kl/kl mice. Neither Pi nor FGF23 antagonized <re> TGF-β <er>1-induced EMT. In contrast, calcitriol ameliorated <re> TGF-β <er>1-induced EMT in a dose dependent manner. A <el> vitamin D3 <le>-deficient diet normalized the serum 1,25 (OH)2 <el> vitamin D3 <le> level in kl/kl mice and enhanced UUO-induced RTF and <re> TGF-β <er>/Smad3 signaling. 
The reported effects of nitric oxide (<re> NO <er>) on dopamine release from the striatum are variable and its precise effect on striatal nerve terminals is unclear. In the present study a novel method of applying <re> NO <er> to brain tissue in situ was employed. Photo-activation of Roussin's Black Salt (<el> RBS <le>), retained in isolated perfused brain tissue, was used to release <re> NO <er> at will upon illumination. Basal and electrically-stimulated dopamine efflux from the rat striatum in vitro was measured in real time using fast cyclic voltammetry. Illumination of an <el> RBS <le> pre-treated brain slice elicited a light intensity-related increase in basal dopamine efflux. Concomitantly there was a decrease in the level of electrically-stimulated dopamine efflux. Illumination in the absence of <el> RBS <le> pre-treatment had no effect on basal or stimulated dopamine efflux. The increase in basal dopamine efflux upon photo-activation of <el> RBS <le> was reduced by the presence of 10 microM oxyhaemoglobin, but was insensitive to the removal of extracellular calcium or the addition of 1 microM sulpiride. The decrease in electrically-stimulated dopamine efflux following illumination was not affected by the presence of either oxyhaemoglobin or sulpiride. 
Crocin is a pharmacologically active component of Crocus sativus L. (saffron) and has been reported to be useful in the treatment of neuronal damage. In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of crocin on retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) after retinal ischaemia/reperfusion (IR) injury, and our results show that crocin acts through the <re> PI3K <er>/AKT signalling pathway. Retinal IR injury was induced by raising the intraocular pressure of Sprague-Dawley rats to 110 mmHg for 60 min. The neuroprotective effect of crocin was determined by quantifying the surviving RGCs and apoptotic RGCs following IR injury by means of retrograde labelling and TUNEL staining, respectively. The phosphorylated AKT protein level was determined by western blot and immunohistochemical analysis. To determine the extent to which the <re> PI3K <er>/AKT pathway contributes to the neuroprotective effect of crocin, experiments were also performed using the <re> PI3K <er> inhibitor LY294002. Compared with the IR + vehicle group, crocin (50 mg/kg) treatment enhanced RGC survival by approximately 36% and decreased RGC <el> apoptosis <le> by 44% after retinal IR injury. Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the <re> PI3K <er>/AKT pathway was activated by crocin in the ganglion cell layer after retinal IR injury. Intravitreal injection of LY294002 blocked the neuroprotective effect of crocin on IR-induced RGC death. 
The neuromuscular effects of <el> desflurane <le> administered alone were studied in ten healthy human volunteers aged 20-27 yr. Also, the dose-response relationships of pancuronium and <re> succinylcholine <er> in surgical patients during anesthesia with <el> desflurane <le> (n = 13) were compared to those during isoflurane anesthesia (n = 14). In the volunteers, we measured the mechanical response of the adductor pollicis muscle to stimulation of the ulnar nerve in a train-of-four (TOF) sequence at 2 Hz and at tetanic frequencies of 50, 100, and 200 Hz, each administered for 5 s. Amplitudes of the first response (T1) in each TOF sequence and the ratios of the fourth TOF response (T4) to the first were similar at 3, 6, and 9% <el> desflurane <le> and decreased significantly only at 12% (P less than 0.05). Desflurane concentrations of 3-12% caused tetanic fade (greater than 10% decrement in amplitude) at 50, 100, and 200 Hz. The addition of N2O and the duration of anesthetic exposure did not alter <el> desflurane <le>'s neuromuscular effects. The only neuromuscular variable influenced by CO2 was T1 amplitude, which decreased as arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) increased. The doses of pancuronium that depressed T1 amplitude by 50% (ED50) were similar during anesthesia with 1.25 MAC <el> desflurane <le>, 10.5 +/- 2.8 micrograms/kg (mean +/- SD) and 1.25 MAC isoflurane, 12.3 +/- 5.0 micrograms/kg. The ED50 doses of <re> succinylcholine <er> were similar during anesthesia with <el> desflurane <le> 132 +/- 76 micrograms/kg and isoflurane 123 +/- 36 micrograms/kg. 
1. Bromsulphthalein (<re> BSP <er>) was administered throughout the experiments at a constant rate well in excess of its excretory rate, to anaesthetized dogs in which the common bile duct had been cannulated. The maximal excretory rate of <re> BSP <er> into bile (<re> BSP <er> T(m)) obtained in this manner was greatly elevated by choleresis arising from the administration of <el> bile salt <le> (usually taurocholate) at constant rate.2. When bile flow rate was increased in stages by raising the taurocholate administration rate, successive increments in <re> BSP <er> excretion rate were obtained up to a limiting value of about 3 times the original T(m). Beyond this point further increases in taurocholate administration rate caused either no further enhancement of <re> BSP <er> T(m) or a decline in the extent of enhancement produced at a previous lower rate of infusion.3. When taurocholate maximal secretion was established first, the subsequent administration of <re> BSP <er> at progressively increasing rates led to reduction in the taurocholate secretion rate.4. Portal infusion of secretin at constant rate (usually 0.2 units/kg body wt. min) which caused substantial increases in bile flow rate, had no effect on <re> BSP <er> T(m). Increases of bile flow rate of the same order following constant taurocholate infusion produced marked elevation of the <re> BSP <er> T(m).5. 
Th17 and γδ T cells are the dominant <re> IL-17 <er>-producing cell. We previously reported that high-mobility group box 1 (<el> HMGB1 <le>) is critical in inducing <re> IL-17 <er>-producing alloreactive T cells during early stage of acute allograft rejection. However, the role of γδ T cells during this process and its implication in <el> HMGB1 <le>-mediated allograft rejection are not fully understood. Here, we use a murine model of cardiac allograft transplantation to further study the role of <el> HMGB1 <le> and <re> IL-17 <er>-producing γδ T cells in acute allograft rejection. It was found that the expression of <el> HMGB1 <le> was increased in allograft, while blockade of <el> HMGB1 <le> suppressed <re> IL-17 <er>(+) γδ T-cell response and inhibited the gene transcription of IL-23 and IL-1β. Furthermore, in vitro <el> HMGB1 <le> indirectly promoted the development of <re> IL-17 <er>(+) γδ T cells by stimulating dendritic cells to produce IL-23 and IL-1β, meanwhile depletion of γδ T cells in vivo prolonged allograft survival and reduced the level of <re> IL-17 <er> in serum. 
A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay with native fluorescence detection was developed for the simultaneous quantification of <re> codeine <er> and its two metabolites, morphine and morphine-3-glucuronide (M-3-G), in rat plasma. Solid-phase extraction was used to separate <re> codeine <er> and its metabolites from plasma constituents. Extraction efficiencies of <re> codeine <er>, morphine and M-3-G from rat plasma samples were 97, 92 and 93%, respectively. The chromatographic separation was performed using a reversed-phase C18 column and an elution gradient at ambient temperature. Using native fluorescence detection (excitation at 245 nm and emission at 345 nm), the detection limits of 50 ng/ml for morphine, 25 ng/ml for <re> codeine <er> and 20 ng/ml for M-3-G were obtained. The method had good precision, accuracy and linearity, and was applied to the study of <el> glutethimide <le>'s influence on <re> codeine <er> metabolism in rat, following single doses of <re> codeine <er>-<el> glutethimide <le> association. The results confirmed the fact that <el> glutethimide <le> was responsible for a significant increase of morphine plasma levels and for their maintenance in time, concomitant with a significant decrease of M-3-G plasma levels, explained by the inhibition of morphine glucuronidation. 
This study examined the effect of acetylcholine (<el> ACh <le>) on the <re> hypoxia-induced apoptosis <er> of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Hypoxia (60 h) decreased both the cell viability and level of [3H] thymidine incorporation, which were prevented by a pretreatment with <el> ACh <le>. However, the atropine (<el> ACh <le> receptor [<el> ACh <le>R] inhibitor) treatment blocked the protective effect of <el> ACh <le>. Hypoxia (90 min) increased the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). On the other hand, <el> ACh <le> inhibited the hypoxia-induced increase in ROS, which was blocked by an atropine treatment. Subsequently, the hypoxia-induced ROS increased the level of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation, which were inhibited by the <el> ACh <le> pretreatment. Moreover, hypoxic exposure (90 min) increased the level of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) phosphorylation, which was blocked by a pretreatment with SB 203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) or SP 600125 (JNK inhibitor). However, hypoxia (60 h) decreased the protein levels of Bcl-2 and c-IAPs (cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins) but increased the level of caspase-3 activation. All these effects were inhibited by a pretreatment with <el> ACh <le>. 
An increase of cytosolic proteolytic activity during ischemic preservation and consecutive tissue degradation have recently been recognized as a major pathogenetic factor for liver injury during ischemia/reperfusion. In the present study, we propose a method for preventing proteolytic tissue disintegration, which results in improved recovery of the liver after transplantation. Livers were harvested from rats and stored for 24 hr at 4 degrees C in University of Wisconsin solution (group A). Others were additionally persufflated with gaseous <el> oxygen <le> via the inferior caval vein during this time (group B). At the end of ischemic preservation, <re> proteolysis <er> was confirmed in group A, with significantly elevated tissue levels of free alanine and free amino groups, whereas <re> proteolysis <er> was prevented in group B. After transplantation, the integrity of the graft was significantly improved in group B, in which there was a 50% reduction of plasma activities of alanine amino-transferase and a twofold increase in hepatic bile production after the onset of reperfusion, as compared with group A. Moreover, venous-systemic <el> oxygen <le> persufflation during cold preservation significantly attenuated the rise in plasma levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) after liver transplantation. 
Significant, sexual dimorphisms exist in counterregulatory responses to commonly occurring stresses, such as hypoglycemia, fasting, and cognitive testing. The question of whether counterregulatory responses differ during exercise in healthy <el> men <le> and women remains controversial. The aim of this study was to determine whether a sexual dimorphism exists in neuroendocrine, metabolic, or cardiovascular responses to prolonged moderate exercise. Sixteen healthy (eight <el> men <le> and eight women) subjects matched for age (28+/-2 yr), body mass index (22+/-1 kg/m2), nutrient intake, and spectrum of physical fitness were studied in a randomized fashion during 90 min of exercise on a cycle ergometer at 80% of their anaerobic threshold (approximately 50% VO2 max). Respiratory quotient and oxygen consumption relative to body weight were identical in <el> men <le> and women. Glycemia was equated (5.3+/-0.2 mmol/L) during exercise via an exogenous glucose infusion. Gender had significant effects on counterregulatory responses during exercise. Arterialized <re> epinephrine <er> (1.05+/-0.2 vs. 0.45+/-0.04 nmol/L), norepinephrine (9.2+/-1.1 vs. 5.8+/-1.1 nmol/L), and pancreatic polypeptide (52+/-6 vs. 37+/-6 pmol/L) were significantly (P<0.01) increased in <el> men <le> compared to women, respectively. Plasma glucagon, cortisol, and GH levels responded similarly in <el> men <le> and women. Insulin values were higher at baseline in <el> men <le> and fell by a greater amount to reach similar levels during exercise compared to those in women. Endogenous glucose production, measured with [3-3H]glucose was similar in <el> men <le> and women. Carbohydrate oxidation was significantly increased in <el> men <le> relative to women (21.2+/-2 vs. 15.6+/-2 mg/kg fat free mass x min; P<0.05). Despite reduced sympathetic nervous system (SNS) drive, lipolytic responses were increased in women. Arterialized blood glycerol (215+/-30 vs. 140+/-20 micromol/L), beta-hydroxybutyrate (54+/-9 vs. 25+/-10 micromol/L), and plasma nonesterified fatty acids (720+/-56 vs. 469+/-103 micromol/L) were significantly (P<0.01) increased in women. In keeping with increased SNS activity, systolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure were significantly increased (P<0.01) in <el> men <le>. In summary, this study demonstrates that a significant sexual dimorphism exists in neuroendocrine, metabolic, and cardiovascular counterregulatory responses to prolonged moderate exercise in man. 
20(S)-Protopanaxadiol (PPD), a ginsenoside isolated from Pananx quinquefolium L., has been shown to inhibit growth and proliferation in several cancer cell lines. The aim of this study was to evaluate its anticancer activity in human breast cancer cells. MCF-7 cells were incubated with different concentrations of 20(S)-PPD and cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT assay. Occurrence of <el> apoptosis <le> was detected by DAPI and Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining. Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured with Rhodamine 123. The Bcl-2 and Bax expression were determined by Western blot analysis. Caspase activity was measured by colorimetric assay. 20(S)-PPD dose-dependently inhibited cell proliferation in MCF-7 cells, with an IC50 value of 33.3 μM at 24h. MCF-7 cells treated with 20(S)-PPD presented typical <el> apoptosis <le>, as observed by morphological analysis in cell stained with DAPI. The percentages of annexin V-FITC positive cells were 8.92%, 17.8%, 24.5% and 30.5% in MCF-7 cells treated with 0, 15, 30 and 60μM of 20(S)-PPD, respectively. Moreover, 20(S)-PPD could induce mitochondrial membrane potential loss, up-regulate Bax expression and down-regulate Bcl-2 expression. These events paralleled activation of caspase-9, -3 and PARP cleavage. Apoptosis induced by 20(S)-PPD was blocked by z-VAD-fmk, a pan-caspase inhibitor, suggesting induction of caspase-mediated apoptotic cell <re> death <er>. 
Cannabinoid-1 (CB1) and CB2 receptors are present on neurons of the enteric nervous system. Our aim was to study whether cannabinoid receptor activation is involved in the regulation of <re> VIP release <er> and NO synthesis in isolated fractions of nerve terminals from rat ileum. VIP was measured by RIA and NO synthesis was analyzed using a L-[3H]arginine assay. Anandamide stimulated <re> VIP release <er> (basal: 245.9+/-12.4pg/mg, 10(-6)M: 307.6+/-11.7pg/mg, [n=6, P<0.05], 10(-7)M: 367.0+/-26.1pg/mg, [n=6, P<0.01]). The cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN 55,212-2 had similar effects (basal: 250.5+/-37.4pg/mg, 10(-6)M: 320.9+/-34.7pg/mg; [n=4, P<0.05]). The stimulatory effect of <el> anandamide <le> was blocked by the selective CB2 receptor antagonist, SR144528 (10(-7)M) (<el> anandamide <le> 10(-6)M: 307.6+/-11.7pg/mg; +SR144528: 249.0+/-26.3pg/mg, [n=6, P<0.05]), whereas the selective CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716 A had no effect. NO synthesis was stimulated by <el> anandamide <le> ([fmol/mg/min] basal: 0.08+/-0.01, 10(-6)M: 0.16+/-0.03; 10(-7)M: 0.13+/-0.02, n=4, P<0.05) and WIN 55,212-2 ([fmol/mg/min] basal: 0.05+/-0.01, 10(-6)M: 0.1+/-0.02, n=4, P<0.05). The <el> anandamide <le> reuptake inhibitor, AM 404 increased basal NOS activity ([fmol/mg/min] control: 0.1+/-0.04, 10(-6)M: 0.28+/-0.08, n=7, P<0.05). The stimulatory effect of <el> anandamide <le> on NO synthase was not antagonized by antagonists at the CB1, CB2 or TRPV1 receptor, respectively. 
In man, <el> GHRH <le> has been shown to potentiate the <re> TSH <er>-releasing activity of TRH. To study the way by which <el> GHRH <le> affects TRH-stimulated <re> TSH <er> release, we examined the effect of <el> GHRH <le> (1-29)NH2 on basal and stimulated <re> TSH <er> secretion in intact male rats and superfused dispersed rat pituitary cells. In the intact rats, <el> GHRH <le>(1-29)NH2 potentiated TRH-stimulated <re> TSH <er> release in the evening, but potentiation was not observed in the morning and in dispersed pituitary cells. Basal <re> TSH <er> levels were not changed by <el> GHRH <le>(1-29)NH2. 
Peripheral stimulation of the innate immune system with <re> LPS <er> causes exaggerated neuroinflammation and prolonged sickness behavior in aged mice. Regular moderate intensity exercise has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects that may protect against inappropriate neuroinflammation and sickness in aged mice. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that voluntary wheel running would attenuate <re> LPS <er>-induced sickness behavior and proinflammatory cytokine gene expression in ~22-month-old C57BL/6J mice. Mice were housed with a running wheel (<el> VWR <le>), locked-wheel (Locked), or no wheel (Standard) for 10 weeks, after which they were intraperitoneally injected with <re> LPS <er> across a range of doses (0.02, 0.08, 0.16, 0.33 mg/kg). <el> VWR <le> mice ran on average 3.5 km/day and lost significantly more body weight and body fat, and increased their forced exercise tolerance compared to Locked and Shoebox mice. <el> VWR <le> had no effect on <re> LPS <er>-induced anorexia, adipsia, weight-loss, or reductions in locomotor activity at any <re> LPS <er> dose when compared to Locked and Shoebox groups. <re> LPS <er> induced sickness behavior in a dose-dependent fashion (0.33>0.02 mg/kg). Twenty-four hours post-injection (0.33 mg/kg <re> LPS <er> or Saline) we found a <re> LPS <er>-induced upregulation of whole brain TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-10 mRNA, and increased IL-1β and IL-6 in the spleen and liver; these effects were not attenuated by <el> VWR <le>. 
Ethanol (0.6 g/100 g) was administered orally to rats by means of an intragastric tube. This caused an accumulation of secretory vesicles laden with VLDL particles which were seen 90 min after administration and later disappeared. Lysosomes and Golgi complex secretory vesicle (GCSV) fractions were isolated. The proteolytic and lipolytic activities of these fractions were measured in order to assess their possible role in the elimination of the initially retained secretory material. There was no change in <re> proteolysis <er> neither in lysosomes or in the GCSV-fraction from <el> ethanol <le>-intoxicated rats when measured by the release of degradation products during incubation. Similarly, the activities of acid hydrolases were unaffected by acute <el> ethanol <le> intoxication. On the other hand, lipolysis increased by some 50-100% in the GCSV fraction, whereas the lysosomes displayed unchanged lipolytic levels compared with controls. Ultrastructurally, the GCSV-fraction from <el> ethanol <le>-intoxicated rat livers showed signs of disintegrated VLDL particles. 
Gemcitabine (2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine, dFdC) is a deoxycytidine (dCyd) analog that extensively modulates intracellular <re> CTP <er> and dCTP metabolism. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, a 4-hour exposure to gemcitabine (100 mumol/L) reduced cellular <re> CTP <er> and dCTP concentrations to 5.9% and 50%, respectively. Intracellular UTP concentrations increased, indicating a metabolic block at <re> CTP <er> synthetase. Pool-sizes of ATP and GTP remained unaffected. In contrast, a CHO mutant deficient in deoxycytidine kinase, and thus unable to accumulate <el> dFdCTP <le>, maintained its <re> CTP <er> pools under identical conditions, suggesting that the <re> CTP <er> pool depletion was dependent on dFdC phosphorylation. Neither 100 mumol/L arabinosylcytosine nor 5 mmol/L hydroxyurea affected <re> CTP <er> levels, indicating that inhibition of DNA synthesis by analog incorporation or by depletion of dNTP pools were not the causes of the <re> CTP <er> pool perturbation. Metabolic studies demonstrated that incorporation of [3H]uridine into the UTP pool was not impaired by dFdC treatment, whereas the specific activity of the <re> CTP <er> pools decreased as a function of increasing gemcitabine concentration and time of exposure. Comparable results were obtained using 3-deazauridine, a known inhibitor of <re> CTP <er> synthetase. 
We investigated the effects of rikkunshito (RKT), a ghrelin signal enhancer, on the decrease in food intake after exposure to novelty stress in mice. RKT administration (500 mg/kg, per os) improved the decrease in 6 h cumulative food intake. In control mice, the plasma acylated ghrelin levels significantly increased by 24 h fasting. In contrast, the acylated ghrelin levels did not increase by fasting in mice exposed to the novelty stress. RKT administration to the novelty stress mice showed a significant increase in the acylated ghrelin levels compared with that in the distilled-water-treated control mice. Food intake after administering serotonin 2B (5-HT(2B)) receptor antagonists was evaluated to clarify the role of <el> 5-HT(2B) receptor <le> activation in the decrease in feeding behavior after novelty stress. SB215505 and SB204741, <el> 5-HT(2B) receptor <le> antagonists, significantly improved the decrease in food intake after exposure to novelty stress. A component of RKT, <re> isoliquiritigenin <er>, prevented the decrease in 6 h cumulative food intake. Isoliquiritigenin showed <el> 5-HT(2B) receptor <le> antagonistic activity in vitro. 
Recombinant human erythropoietin has been demonstrated to significantly increase autologous blood procurement. To determine the importance of dietary or prescribed <el> iron <le> absorption, we analyzed <el> iron <le>-restricted erythropoiesis in this setting. No differences were found when premenopausal placebo and erythropoietin treatment groups were compared for hematocrit changes, number of units donated, percentage of phlebotomies deferred, and total blood volume procured. Seven of 10 women who had not reached <re> men <er>opause donated more blood <el> iron <le> than the apparent amount of total mobilizable <el> iron <le> available, demonstrating that dietary or prescribed <el> iron <le> had to be absorbed to donate the amount of blood <el> iron <le> stored. Thus oral <el> iron <le> absorption can potentially be a limitation to erythropoiesis in the presence of erythropoiesis therapy in women who have not reached <re> men <er>opause. In contrast, none of 16 women who had reached <re> men <er>opause and only two of 21 <re> men <er> required oral absorption of dietary or prescribed <el> iron <le> for the amount of blood <el> iron <le> donated. 
The combined effects of lactic acid and <el> acetic acid <le> on <re> ethanol <er> production by S. cerevisiae in corn mash, as influenced by temperature, were examined. Duplicate full factorial experiments (three lactic acid concentrations x three <el> acetic acid <le> concentrations) were performed to evaluate the interaction between lactic and <el> acetic acid <le>s on the <re> ethanol <er> production of yeast at each of the three temperatures, 30, 34, and 37 degrees C. Corn mash at 30% dry solids adjusted to pH 4 after lactic and <el> acetic acid <le> addition was used as the substrate. Ethanol production rates and final <re> ethanol <er> concentrations decreased (P<0.001) progressively as the concentration of combined lactic and <el> acetic acid <le>s in the corn mash increased and the temperature was raised from 30 to 37 degrees C. At 30 degrees C, essentially no <re> ethanol <er> was produced after 96 h when 0.5% w/v <el> acetic acid <le> was present in the mash (with 0.5, 2, and 4% w/v lactic acid). At 34 and 37 degrees C, the final concentrations of <re> ethanol <er> produced by the yeast were noticeably reduced by the presence of 0.3% w/v <el> acetic acid <le> and >or=2% w/v lactic acid. 
Genetic and biochemical analyses show that IL-23p19 plays a central role in mediating bacteria-induced colitis in interleukin-10-deficient (IL-10(-/-)) mice. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the dysregulated innate host response leading to enhanced IL-23 gene expression in IL-10(-/-) mice are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of Bcl3 in controlling <el> LPS <le>-induced <re> IL-23p19 gene expression <er> in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) isolated from IL-10(-/-) mice. We report higher IL-23p19 mRNA accumulation and protein secretion in <el> LPS <le>-stimulated BMDC isolated from IL-10(-/-) compared with WT mice. Lipopolysaccharide (<el> LPS <le>)-induced B cell leukemia 3 (Bcl3) expression was strongly impaired (90% decrease) in IL-10(-/-) BMDC compared with WT BMDC. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated enhanced RelA binding to the IL-23p19 promoter in IL-10(-/-) compared with WT BMDC. Bcl3 overexpression decreased <el> LPS <le>-induced <re> IL-23p19 gene expression <er> in IL-10(-/-) BMDC, which correlated with enhanced NF-kappaB p50 binding and decreased RelA binding to the gene promoter. Conversely, Bcl3 knockdown enhanced <el> LPS <le>-induced <re> IL-23p19 gene expression <er> in WT BMDC. Moreover, <el> LPS <le>-induced <re> IL-23p19 gene expression <er> was significantly enhanced in Bcl3(-/-) BMDC compared with WT BMDC. 
Using a natural exposure trial design, the goal of our study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of an <el> iodine <le> teat disinfectant with barrier properties and a high level of free <el> iodine <le> relative to a conventional <el> iodine <le> teat disinfectant with no barrier properties and low levels of free <el> iodine <le>. During the 18 wk of the trial, quarter milk samples were collected every 2 wk from 385 dairy cows from 2 herds. Cows on both farms were assigned in a balanced way according to milk yield, number of lactation, days in milk, somatic cell count (SCC) and microbiology culture pretrial into one of following groups: nonbarrier post milking teat disinfectant (NBAR; n = 195 cows; 747 quarters) or barrier postmilking teat disinfectant (BAR; n = 190 cows; 728 quarters). Afterward, at each scoring date every 2 wk, milk SCC was quantified in samples from all mammary quarters and microbiologic culture was only performed on milk samples with SCC >200,000 cells/mL for multiparous cows and SCC >100,000 cells/mL for primiparous cows. A new intramammary infection (NIMI) was defined when a quarter had milk SCC <200,000 cells/mL for multiparous cows and <100,000 cells/mL for primiparous without microorganism isolation, and in a subsequent sampling visit had milk SCC >200,000 cells/mL for multiparous cows and >100,000 cells/mL for primiparous cows, and positive microorganism isolation. A quarter could have several NIMI, but only 1 case per specific pathogen was considered. The most frequently isolated microorganism group on both farms was Streptococcus spp. (6.25% of total mammary quarters), followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (3.6%) and Corynebacterium spp. (1.5%). In the present study, an interaction occurred between treatment and week of trial on the incidence risk of NIMI. Quarters disinfected with BAR had 54 and 37% lower odds of NIMI than quarters disinfected with NBAR at 8 and 16 wk of the trial, respectively; whereas at other weeks of the study both products had similar incidence risks of NIMI. Overall, teats disinfected with BAR had 46% lower odds of acquiring a clinical <re> mastitis <er> than those disinfected with NBAR. 
Vitamin D is stored in body fat. The purpose of this study was to determine <el> vitamin D <le> concentration in abdominal fat of obese patients who underwent roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and to describe changes in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(<re> OH <er>)D) levels in relation to loss of body fat. Subjects from a single clinic who were scheduled for RYGB were invited into the study. Abdominal subcutaneous, omental, and mesenteric fat were obtained at time of surgery. Adipose <el> vitamin D <le>(2) and <el> vitamin D <le>(3) concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Weight and serum 25(<re> OH <er>)D were assessed at baseline and every 3 months up to 1 year. Seventeen subjects were included, and fat samples were available from eleven. Total <el> vitamin D <le> content in subcutaneous abdominal fat was 297.2 ± 727.7 ng/g tissue, and a wide range was observed (4-2,470 ng/g). Both <el> vitamin D <le>(2) and <el> vitamin D <le>(3) were detected in some of the fat samples. At baseline, 25(<re> OH <er>)D was 23.1 ± 12.6 ng/ml. Average weight loss was 54.8 kg at 12 months, of which ~40 kg was fat mass. Despite daily <el> vitamin D <le> intake of ≥2,500 IU throughout the study, no significant increase in serum 25(<re> OH <er>)D was observed, with mean serum concentration of 25(<re> OH <er>)D at 1 year of 26.2 ± 5.36 ng/ml (P = 0.58). 
We aimed to study the intracellular signaling mechanisms involved in the stimulation and suppression of <re> renin secretion <er> from human nephroblastoma cells. Isoproterenol and forskolin increased intracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) concentration and stimulated <re> renin secretion <er> as did the addition of dibutyryl-cAMP. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) suppressed basal <re> renin secretion <er> and increased the concentration of extracellular guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (<el> cGMP <le>). When ANP was added in the presence of isoproterenol or forskolin, the increase in <el> cGMP <le> was reduced. ANP attenuated the cAMP response to isoproterenol but not forskolin. Nephroblastoma cell membranes contained the guanosine-binding proteins Gs and Gi2, and the isoforms were similar to those in vascular smooth muscle. A functional role for Gi was indicated because the ANP-induced suppression of basal <re> renin secretion <er> was blocked by pertussis toxin. 
A possible involvement of <re> endocannabinoid <er>s in a chronic model of endotoxemia was assessed by measuring the regional (renal, mesenteric, hindquarters) hemodynamic responses to continuous 24-h LPS infusion (150 microg.kg(-1).h(-1)) in conscious, male Sprague-Dawley rats, in the absence or presence of the cannabinoid (CB1) receptor antagonist <el> AM-251 <le> (3 mg/kg). <el> AM-251 <le> inhibited the tachycardic and hindquarters vasodilator effects of LPS, but did not influence the other hemodynamic changes. In subsequent experiments, it was shown that the tachycardic and hindquarters vasodilator effects of LPS were also inhibited by the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. In addition, the late (at 24 h) hindquarters vasodilator effects of LPS were inhibited by the beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI-118551. 
The monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) obtained in mice immunized with human PRL coupled to an anti-PRL MAb were screened for their ability to distinguish the glycosylated (<el> G- <le>) and nonglycosylated (NG-) forms of PRL. The 431-29 MAb exhibited high affinity binding for NG-PRL but little or no cross-reactivity to <el> G- <le>PRL. Using this antibody in conjunction with other MAbs which equally recognized both forms, we developed 2 immunoradiometric assays which were used to determine the amount of <el> G- <le> and NG-PRL in plasma. In 85 normal subjects, NG-PRL baseline levels averaged 6.6 +/- 3 micrograms/L, and represented 76 +/- 8% of the total PRL immunoreactivity. In 74 pregnant women, this proportion was significantly higher during the last 2 trimesters (84 +/- 4% and 85 +/- 6%), as compared to the first trimester (76 +/- 7%). In 6 healthy volunteers studied over 24 h, 79% of the NG-PRL peaks detected using the cluster algorithm occurred concomitantly to a <el> G- <le>PRL peak. The mean NG-PRL/PRL ratio was significantly higher during NG-PRL pulses (81 +/- 9%) than during valleys (71 +/- 12%). Similarly, this ratio was significantly increased during TRH or metoclopramide stimulated <re> PRL secretion <er> (to 88 +/- 7% and 86 +/- 6%, respectively). 
Bone metastasis of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) usually occurs early in the progression of the disease. However, the molecular mechanism underlying bone metastasis is largely unknown. <el> MGr1-Ag <le>, a multifunction protein, has been suggested to play important roles in cell growth, differentiation and migration. In our present study, <el> MGr1-Ag <le> was found to be highly expressed in bone-metastatic SCLC cells (SBC-5 cell line) as compared with the expression in cells without bone-metastatic ability (SBC-3 cell line). Therefore, we hypothesized that <el> MGr1-Ag <le> is involved in bone metastasis of SCLC. Using a sense vector to upregulate <el> MGr1-Ag <le> expression in SBC-3 cells, we found that forced overexpression of <el> MGr1-Ag <le> enhanced cell <re> invasion <er> and migration in vitro and promoted bone metastases in vivo. Furthermore, specific siRNA-induced knockdown of <el> MGr1-Ag <le> expression in SBC-5 cells suppressed the potential of cell <re> invasion <er> and migration in vitro and dramatically decreased the number and sites of bone metastasis in vivo. We also found that <el> MGr1-Ag <le> induced SCLC cells to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as demonstrated by cell morphological changes, decreased expression of epithelial markers and increased expression of mesenchymal markers. 
Most centrally mediated sympathoexcitatory reflexes produce increases in arterial pressure, heart rate, and peripheral vascular resistance, including coronary <re> vasoconstriction <er>. Cerebral <el> ischemia <le> also causes large increases in arterial pressure and peripheral <re> vasoconstriction <er> but with modest or variable changes in heart rate. To examine the effect of cerebral <el> ischemia <le> on coronary vascular resistance, we produced cerebral <el> ischemia <le> in 14 cats by occluding the right brachiocephalic and left subclavian arteries for 30 seconds. After vagotomy and beta-blockade, a marked increase in arterial pressure (89 +/- 14%) and coronary vascular resistance (52 +/- 7%) was seen. After inhibition of the carotid baroreceptor reflex by surgical denervation and application of topical lidocaine, the increase in arterial pressure to cerebral <el> ischemia <le> was not affected, but the increase in coronary vascular resistance was attenuated (33 +/- 6%; p < 0.05 versus before denervation) to a level expected with autoregulation. To evaluate the possible contribution of the chemoreflex on coronary blood flow during cerebral <el> ischemia <le>, we conducted separate experiments in which nicotine was injected into both carotid arteries. Coronary constriction was not observed. Adrenalectomy and upper extremity <el> ischemia <le> likewise did not alter coronary vascular resistance. 
Hypertriglyceridemia is known to be a feature of obesity-related NIDDM, but the patho-etiological significance of this association is obscure. The effects of triglycerides (TGs) on beta-cell function and morphological changes in pancreas were examined using in vivo and in vitro approaches in male OLETF rats at ages 6, 12, and 30 weeks, with their diabetes-resistant counterpart, LETO rats, as normal controls. The results showed that, in the fasting state, plasma TGs in OLETF rats were increased 2.5-fold at age 6 weeks, 3.3-fold at age 12 weeks, and 6.2-fold at age 30 weeks, compared with age-matched LETO rats. The TG content in islets from 12-week-old OLETF rats was significantly increased when compared with those from their age-matched counterparts, but this was not the case with the 6-week-old OLETF rats. Therefore, the islets from 6-week-old rats were cultured with either free fatty acids (FFAs; 1.0 mmol/l sodium oleate) or TG (5.0 mmol/l Intralipide) for 72 h. Several abnormalities in OLETF rats were evident, in contrast to the results from control LETO rats: 1) <el> glucose <le>-induced <re> insulin secretion <er> was more inhibited by either FFAs or TGs in the presence of 27.7 mmol/l <el> glucose <le>, a result associated, at least in part, with reduced glucokinase activity in the islets; 2) a marked elevation in TG content was found in the islets; and 3) the deposition of fat droplets in the enlarged islets, even in the beta-cells, was found by Oil Red O-insulin double staining at age 30 weeks. 
Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are frequently induced using <el> 3D <le> culture methodologies however, it is unknown whether spheroid-based (<el> 3D <le>) neural induction is actually superior to monolayer (2D) neural induction. Our aim was to compare the efficiency of 2D induction with <el> 3D <le> induction method in their ability to generate NPCs, and subsequently neurons and astrocytes. Neural differentiation was analysed at the protein level qualitatively by immunocytochemistry and quantitatively by flow cytometry for NPC (SOX1, <re> PAX6 <er>, NESTIN), neuronal (MAP2, TUBB3), cortical layer (TBR1, CUX1) and glial markers (SOX9, GFAP, AQP4). Electron microscopy demonstrated that both methods resulted in morphologically similar neural rosettes. However, quantification of NPCs derived from <el> 3D <le> neural induction exhibited an increase in the number of <re> PAX6 <er>/NESTIN double positive cells and the derived neurons exhibited longer neurites. In contrast, 2D neural induction resulted in more SOX1 positive cells. While 2D monolayer induction resulted in slightly less mature neurons, at an early stage of differentiation, the patch clamp analysis failed to reveal any significant differences between the electrophysiological properties between the two induction methods. 
Energy reserves (TAN) and anaerobic substrates (<el> glucose <le>, glycogen) are lower in renal than in myocardial tissue. Euro-Collins-solution contains nearly 200 mmol/l <el> glucose <le>, while the HTK-solution of Bretschneider contains none. Therefore the influence of <el> glucose <le> on kidney <re> lactate <er> production, on energy reserves (TAN), intrarenal pH and on morphology during the protection of ischemic kidneys was analysed using either Euro-Collins-solution, or modified "Euro-Collins-solution", containing mannitol instead of <el> glucose <le>, or HTK-solution with and without the addition of 5, 10 and 20 mmol/l <el> glucose <le>. Glucose content changed during kidney perfusion with Euro-Collins-solution from about 60 to 800 mumol/gdw. While intrarenal pH decreased from 7.1 to 5.1 in Euro-Collins-kidneys during 420 min of ischemia at 25 degrees C, pH decreased to 6.7 with the modified, mannitol containing "Euro-Collins-solution". In HTK-protected kidneys intrarenal pH decreased with increasing <el> glucose <le> addition to the solution. Although Total Adenine Nucleotides are highest at the end of ischemia with Euro-Collins-solution, structural protection after the same ischemic stress was best in HTK-protected kidneys without <el> glucose <le> addition. 
Synaptic terminals often contain metabotropic receptors that act as autoreceptors to control neurotransmitter release. Less appreciated is the heterosynaptic crossover of glutamate receptors to control GABA release and vice versa GABA receptors which control glutamate release. In the brainstem, activation of solitary tract (ST) afferents releases glutamate onto second-order neurons within the solitary tract nucleus (<el> NTS <le>). Multiple metabotropic receptors are expressed in <el> NTS <le> for glutamate (<re> mGluR <er>s) and for GABA (GABA(B)). The present report identifies <re> mGluR <er> regulation of glutamate release at second and higher order sensory neurons in <el> NTS <le> slices. We found strong inhibition of glutamate release to group II and III <re> mGluR <er> activation on mechanically isolated <el> NTS <le> neurons. However, the same <re> mGluR <er>-selective antagonists paradoxically decreased glutamate release (miniature, mEPSCs) at identified second-order <el> NTS <le> neurons. Unaltered amplitudes were consistent with selective presynaptic <re> mGluR <er> actions. GABA(B) blockade in slices resolved the paradoxical differences and revealed a group II/III <re> mGluR <er> negative feedback of mEPSC frequency similar to isolated neurons. Thus, the balance of glutamate control is tipped by <re> mGluR <er> receptors on GABA terminals resulting in predominating heterosynaptic GABA(B) inhibition of glutamate release. Regulation by <re> mGluR <er> or GABA(B) was not consistently evident in excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in higher-order <el> NTS <le> neurons demonstrating metabotropic receptor distinctions in processing at different <el> NTS <le> pathway stages. These cellular localizations may figure importantly in understanding interventions such as brain-penetrant compounds or microinjections. 
The management of ecosystem has been a major contributor to the control of <re> diseases <er> that are transmitted by <el> snail <le> intermediate hosts. The ability of freshwater <el> snail <le>s to self-fertilize, giving rise to thousands of hatchlings, enables them to contribute immensely to the difficulty in reducing the endemicity of some infections in the world. One of the effects of land use/land cover change (LU/LCC) is deforestation, which, in turn, leads to the creation of suitable habitats for the survival of freshwater <el> snail <le>s. This study was aimed at studying the land use/land cover change, physico-chemical parameters of water bodies and to understand the interplay between them and freshwater <el> snail <le>s in an environment where a new industrial plant was established. Landsat TM, 1984, Landsat ETM+ 2000 and Operational land Imager (OLI) 2014 imageries of the study area were digitally processed using ERDAS Imagine. The land use classification includes settlement, water bodies, wetlands, vegetation and exposed surface. Dissolved oxygen, water temperature, pH, total dissolved solids and conductivity were measured with multipurpose digital meters. Snail sampling was done at each site for 30 minutes along the littoral zones, using a long-handled scoop (0.2mm mesh size) net once every month for 24 months. Independent t-test was used to determine the variation between seasons, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to test the relationship between physico-chemical parameters and <el> snail <le> species while regression was used to analyze the relationship between LU/LCC and freshwater <el> snail <le>s. Species' richness, diversity and evenness were examined using Margalef, Shannon Weiner and Equitability indexes. Snail species recovered include: Bulinus globosus, Bulinus jousseaumei, Bulinus camerunensis, Bulinus senegalensis, Bulinus forskalii, Amerianna carinatus, Ferrissia spp., Segmentorbis augustus, Lymnaea natalensis, Melanoides tuberculata, Physa acuta, Gyraulus costulatus, Indoplanorbis exuxtus and Gibbiella species. Out of the total <el> snail <le>s recovered, M. tuberculata (2907) was the most abundant, followed by Lymnaea natalensis (1542). The highest number of <el> snail <le> species was recovered from Iho River while the least number of <el> snail <le>s was recovered from Euro River. The mean and standard deviation of physico-chemical parameters of the water bodies were DO (2.13±0.9 mg/L), pH (6.80±0.4), TDS (50.58±18.8 mg/L), Temperature (26.2±0.9°C) and Conductivity (74.00±27.5 μS/cm). There was significant positive correlation between pH and B. globosus (r = 0.439; P<0.05). Dissolved oxygen showed significant positive correlation with B. globosus (r = 0.454; P<0.05) and M. tuberculata (r = 0.687; P<0.01). There was a positive significant relationship between LULCC and B. camerunensis (p<0.05). The positive relationship between LULCC and the abundance of B. globosus, B. jousseaumei was not significant. The area covered by water bodies increased from 3.72 to 4.51 kilometers; this indicates that, more suitable habitats were being created for the multiplication of freshwater <el> snail <le>s. 
Loss of extracellular superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3) contributes to inflammatory and fibrotic lung diseases. The human SOD3 R213G polymorphism decreases matrix binding, redistributing SOD3 from the lung to extracellular fluids, and protects against LPS-induced alveolar inflammation. We used R213G <el> mice <le> expressing a naturally occurring single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs1799895, within the heparin-binding domain of SOD3, which results in an amino acid substitution at position 213 to test the hypothesis that the redistribution of SOD3 into the extracellular fluids would impart protection against bleomycin-induced lung <re> fibrosis <er> and secondary pulmonary hypertension (PH). In R213G <el> mice <le>, SOD3 content and activity was increased in extracellular fluids and decreased in lung at baseline, with greater increases in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) SOD3 compared with wild-type <el> mice <le> 3 days after bleomycin. R213G <el> mice <le> developed less <re> fibrosis <er> based on pulmonary mechanics, <re> fibrosis <er> scoring, collagen quantification, and gene expression at 21 days, and less PH by right ventricular systolic pressure and pulmonary arteriole medial wall thickening at 28 days. In wild-type <el> mice <le>, macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, proinflammatory cytokines, and protein increased in BALF on Day 7 and/or 21. In R213G <el> mice <le>, total BALF cell counts increased on Day 7 but resolved by 21 days. At 1 or 3 days, BALF pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines and BALF protein were higher in R213G <el> mice <le>, resolving by 21 days. 
Polyozellus multiplex (Thelephoraceae) is a wild mushroom in Korea and Japan and is usually harvested in early autumn for food. Polyozellin, a major constituent of the edible mushroom P multiplex, has been known to exhibit biological activities such as antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. Transforming growth factor β-induced protein (<re> TGFBIp <er>) is an extracellular matrix protein whose expression in several cell types is greatly increased by TGF-β. <re> TGFBIp <er> is released by human umbilical vein endothelial cells and functions as a mediator of experimental sepsis. We hypothesized that <el> polyozellin <le> could reduce <re> TGFBIp <er>-mediated severe inflammatory responses in human endothelial cells and mice. Here, we investigated the antiseptic effects and underlying mechanisms of <el> polyozellin <le> against <re> TGFBIp <er>-mediated septic responses. Polyozellin effectively inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced release of <re> TGFBIp <er> and suppressed <re> TGFBIp <er>-mediated septic responses. In addition, <el> polyozellin <le> suppressed cecal ligation and puncture-induced sepsis lethality and pulmonary injury. 
We previously reported the development of epidermal growth factor receptor (<re> EGFR <er>)-targeted immunoliposomes that bind and internalize in tumor cells which overexpress <re> EGFR <er> and/or mutant <re> EGFR <er> variant III (<re> EGFR <er>vIII), enabling intracellular delivery of potent anticancer agents in vitro. We now describe in vivo proof-of-concept for this approach for the delivery of multiple anticancer drugs in <re> EGFR <er>-overexpressing tumor models. Anti-<re> EGFR <er> immunoliposomes were constructed modularly with Fab' fragments of cetuximab (IMC-C225), covalently linked to liposomes containing probes and/or anticancer drugs. Pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies confirmed long circulation times (t(1/2) = 21 hours) and efficient accumulation in <el> tumors <le> (up to 15% ID/g) irrespective of the presence of the targeting ligand. Although total accumulations of anti-<re> EGFR <er> immunoliposomes and nontargeted liposomes in <re> EGFR <er>-overexpressing <el> tumors <le> were comparable, only immunoliposomes internalized extensively within tumor cells (92% of analyzed cells versus <5% for nontargeted liposomes), indicating different mechanisms of delivery at the cellular level. In vivo therapy studies in a series of xenograft models featuring overexpression of <re> EGFR <er> and/or <re> EGFR <er>vIII showed the superiority of immunoliposomal delivery of encapsulated drugs, which included doxorubicin, epirubicin, and vinorelbine. For each of these drugs, anti-<re> EGFR <er> immunoliposome delivery showed significant antitumor effects and was significantly superior to all other treatments, including the corresponding free or liposomal drug (P < 0.001-0.003). 
Diabetic patients have an elevated risk to develop renal dysfunction and it has been postulated that altered energy metabolism is involved. We have previously shown that diabetic rats have markedly decreased oxygen availability in the kidney, resulting from increased oxygen consumption. A substantial part of the increased oxygen consumption is unrelated to tubular transport, suggesting decreased mitochondrial efficiency. In this study, we investigated the protein expression of mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 in kidney tissue from control and streptozotocin (<el> STZ <le>)-induced diabetic rats. Protein levels of UCP-2 were measured in adult male control and <el> STZ <le>-diabetic Wistar Furth as well as Sprague Dawley rats in both the kidney cortex and medulla by Western blot technique. Two weeks of <re> hyperglycemia <er> resulted in increased protein levels of UCP-2 in kidneys from both Wistar Furth and Sprague Dawley rats. Both cortical and medullary UCP-2 levels were elevated 2-3 fold above control levels. 
A cell line, RIN-m, established from a transplantable rat islet cell tumor secretes insulin (IRI) and somatostatin (SRIF) and expresses high levels of the key amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation (APUD) cell enzyme L-dopa-decarboxylase (DDC). Conditioned medium from a rat <el> pituitary tumor <le> line <re> GH <er>3, secreting <re> GH <er> and PRL, improved the cloning efficiency of RIN-m cells 24-fold and enabled the isolation and establishment of a large number of primary and secondary clones. These clones were used to study clonal relationships between peptide hormone secretion and APUD features of an endocrine cell. All the primary and secondary clonal derivatives, irrespective of whether they secreted peptide hormones, maintained high levels of DDC activity. In contrast, IRI and SRIF secretion patterns of the primary clones were highly variable. Selective recloning of primary clones resulted in the isolation of subclones which produced either no hormones or high levels of either IRI or SRIF, but no clone that continuously secreted high levels of both IRI and SRIF. 
Almitrine and doxapram, two structurally unrelated peripheral chemoreceptor agonists, have been shown to enhance hypoxic pulmonary <re> vasoconstriction <er> in anesthetized dogs. We hypothesized that these drugs would increase pulmonary vascular tone and improve gas exchange in canine lung injury caused by oleic acid (OA). Pulmonary hemodynamics and gas exchange were investigated in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs before and after intravenously administered OA 0.09 ml/kg and again after placebo (n = 6), <el> almitrine <le> 2 micrograms/kg/min (n = 6), or doxapram 20 micrograms/kg/min (n = 6) in a randomized order. Cardiac output (Q) was manipulated using a femoral arteriovenous bypass and an inferior vena cava balloon catheter to construct mean pulmonary artery pressure (Ppa)-Q plots in order to discriminate active from passive changes in Ppa. Gas exchange was assessed by measuring arterial PO2 and intrapulmonary shunt, determined using a sulfur hexafluoride infusion. OA increased Ppa over the range of Q studied, and it deteriorated gas exchange by an increase in intrapulmonary shunt. After OA, placebo had no effect on Ppa, arterial PO2, or intrapulmonary shunt. Both <el> almitrine <le> and doxapram further increased Ppa at all levels of Q studied, but they did not affect indices of gas exchange after OA. 
The killing and postantibiotic effects (<re> PAE <er>) of cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin against Escherichia coli were determined in Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB) and pooled human cerebrospinal fluid (<el> CSF <le>). MICs performed in MHB and <el> CSF <le> were within one dilution for all antimicrobial agent-organism combinations. At two times the MIC, <el> CSF <le> significantly (P less than 0.05) increased the duration of the <re> PAE <er> compared with MHB when cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin were used against all strains tested. This effect occurred despite similar reductions in bacterial growth in both fluids after the 2-h antimicrobial agent exposure. 
Purvalanol, a novel cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, is referred to as a strong apoptotic inducer which causes cell cycle arrest in various cancer cells such as prostate, breast and colon cancer cell lines. Various physiological and pathological conditions such as glucose starvation, inhibition of protein glycosylation and oxidative stress may cause an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to the unfolded protein response (UPR) and <re> autophagy <er>. Lacking proteosomal function on aggregates of unfolded proteins, ER stress may induce autophagic machinery. Autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved process, is characterized by massive degradation of cytosolic contents. In the present study, our aim was to determine the time-dependent, ER-mediated apoptotic and <re> autophagy <er> induction of <el> purvalanol <le> in HCT 116 colon cancer cells. Fifteen micromoles of <el> purvalanol <le> induced a reduction in cell viability by 20 and 35% within 24 and 48 h, respectively. HCT 116 colon cancer cells were exposed to <el> purvalanol <le>, which activated ER stress via upregulation of PERK, IRE1α gene expression, eIF-2α phosphorylation and ATF-6 cleavage at early time-points in the HCT 116 colon cancer cells. Moreover, we determined that during <el> purvalanol <le>-mediated ER stress, autophagic machinery was also activated prior to apoptotic cell death finalization. Beclin-1 and Atg-5 expression levels were upregulated and LC3 was cleaved after a 6 h <el> purvalanol <le> treatment. Purvalanol induced mitochondrial membrane potential loss, caspase-7 and caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage following a 48 h treatment. 
Hydrocephalus has been demonstrated to be an independent risk factor for poor outcomes in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Blockage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow and drainage is widely considered to play a vital role in communicating hydrocephalus, possibly due to subarachnoid fibrosis. A previous study indicated that transforming growth factor-β1 (<re> TGF-β <er>1), a key fibrogenic factor, is significantly increased in the CSF following SAH, implying a pivotal role in the development of chronic hydrocephalus. To investigate whether LSKL peptide, a small molecular peptide and competitive antagonist for <re> TGF-β <er>1, protects against subarachnoid fibrosis and hydrocephalus after SAH, a two-hemorrhage injection model of SAH was created in Sprague-Dawley rats. LSKL (1 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally immediately following the first intravenous injection of blood in the SAH model, with repeated injections of LSKL every 12 h until sacrifice. Thrombospondin-1 (<el> TSP1 <le>), <re> TGF-β <er>1, p-Smad2/3, collagen I and pro-collagen I c-terminal propeptide levels were assessed via western blotting and ELISA. Lateral ventricular index, Masson staining and Morris water maze tests were employed to evaluate subarachnoid fibrosis, hydrocephalus and long-term neurological function following SAH. It was found that the LKSL peptide readily crossed the blood brain barrier, was protective against subarachnoid fibrosis, attenuated ventriculomegaly and effectively suppressed hydrocephalus. In addition, the results indicated that the protective effects of the LSKL peptide were achieved via the inhibition of <re> TGF-β <er>1 activity and subsequent Smad2/3 signaling. Importantly, the LSKL peptide may improve long-term neurocognitive deficits after SAH. 
Myocardial hypoxia and ischemia result in the production of <el> lactate <le>. To study the effect of <el> lactate <le> on the rapid Na+ current (<re> INa <er>), we used the whole cell voltage-clamp technique in enzymatically isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes. Experiments were conducted at 16 degrees C. Extracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]o) was maintained in control and test solutions and extracellular pH was 7.4. Lactate (4-10 mM, either sodium <el> lactate <le> or lactic acid) augmented <re> INa <er> in each of eight experiments, increasing the peak Na+ conductance from 75.4 to 84.7 nS (13-16% at all test voltages in the linear portion of the conductance curve). The voltage dependence of steady-state availability and the time course of inactivation remained unchanged. The increase in peak Na+ conductance was concentration dependent, with an apparent dissociation constant of 1.8 mM and Hill coefficient of 1.8. Lactate in the range of 1-10 mM did not significantly reduce the Ca2+ activity of test solutions. These effects of <el> lactate <le> were still observed in Mg(2+)-free test solutions and when the buffering capacity of internal solution was reinforced by increasing N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid concentration from 5 to 20 mM. 
Human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DC) (<el> PDC <le>, CD123+) and myeloid DC (MDC, CD11c+) may be able to discriminate between distinct classes of microbial molecules based on a different pattern of Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression. TLR1-TLR9 were examined in purified <el> PDC <le> and MDC. TLR9, which is critically involved in the recognition of CpG motifs in mice, was present in <el> PDC <le> but not in MDC. TLR4, which is required for the response to LPS, was selectively expressed on MDC. Consistent with TLR expression, <el> PDC <le> were susceptible to stimulation by CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) but not by LPS, while MDC responded to LPS but not to CpG ODN. In <el> PDC <le>, CpG ODN supported survival, activation (CD80, CD86, CD40, MHC class II), chemokine production (IL-8, IP-10) and maturation (CD83). CD40 ligand (CD40L) and CpG ODN synergized to activate <el> PDC <le> and to stimulate the production of IFN-alpha and IL-12 including bioactive IL-12 <re> p70 <er>. Previous incubation of <el> PDC <le> with IL-3 decreased the amount of CpG-induced IFN-alpha and shifted the cytokine response in favor of IL-12. CpG ODN-activated <el> PDC <le> showed an increased ability to stimulate proliferation of naive allogeneic CD4 T cells, butTh1 polarization of developing T cells required simultaneous activation of <el> PDC <le> by CD40 ligation and CpG ODN. CpG ODN-stimulated <el> PDC <le> expressed CCR7, which mediates homing to lymph nodes. 
Down-regulation of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) receptors was investigated using a cultured bovine pulmonary artery endothelial (CPAE) cell line. Endothelial cells have been shown to possess two subtypes of ANP receptors, a guanylate cyclase-coupled receptor (B-receptor) and a clearance receptor (<re> C-receptor <er>). The treatment with APIII, rat ANP (103-126), at concentrations of 10(-8) to 10(-6) M for 24 h, resulted in a significantly (p less than 0.01) greater decrease in maximum 125I-APIII binding to CPAE cells than the identical concentration of API, rat ANP (103-123). APIII at concentrations of 10(-8) to 10(-6) M stimulated cyclic GMP (<el> cGMP <le>) production 3.3-17.5-fold greater than similar concentrations of API. From these findings, we hypothesized that <el> cGMP <le> produced following ANP binding to the B-receptor participates in ANP receptor regulation. M&B 22948, a selective inhibitor of <el> cGMP <le>-specific phosphodiesterase, significantly (p less than 0.01) potentiated the effect of both API and APIII on 125I-APIII binding, while M&B 22948 itself had no significant effect on 125I-APIII binding. Treatment of the cells with 1 mM 8-bromo-<el> cGMP <le> also significantly (p less than 0.01) decreased 125I-APIII binding to the cells, and a potentiation of this effect was observed by M&B 22948. Scatchard analysis of binding data from 8-bromo-<el> cGMP <le>-treated cells showed a significant decrease in Bmax (1.79 +/- 0.15 to 1.20 +/- 0.07 fmol/mg protein, p less than 0.05) without a significant change in Kd. Affinity cross-linking of 125I-APIII to 8-bromo-<el> cGMP <le>-treated cells showed a decrease in the labeling of 60- and 70-kDa bands corresponding to the <re> C-receptor <er>. In addition, the APIII-stimulated <el> cGMP <le> response remained unchanged in the 8-bromo-<el> cGMP <le>-treated cells, indicating that the B-receptor was not down-regulated. 
Myocardial cells utilize membrane transport systems for proton extrusion as well as internal buffers to preserve pH homeostasis. Our laboratory had shown previously that <el> amiloride <le> (0.01-1.0 mM) causes a time- and dose-dependent increase in action potential duration, early after depolarizations and enhanced automaticity. Ion-selective microelectrode technique was used to evaluate whether the observed electrophysiologic effects of <el> amiloride <le> are linked to inhibition of <re> Na/H <er> exchange and subsequent inability of the myocardial cell to maintain steady-state intracellular pH (pHi), either under normal physiological conditions or in the presence of an imposed acid load. We analyzed different components of intracellular pH transients that occur in response to NH4Cl exposure and washout, which allowed us to quantitatively describe the effects of <re> Na/H <er> exchange inhibition in a multicellular preparation. Amiloride (0.01-1.0 mM) did not change the steady-state pHi, but did cause a dose-dependent increase in both the time for the pHi to reach a minimum value (time-to-peak) during washout of NH4Cl as well as in the absolute minimum value of pHi (peak acid). The effects of <el> amiloride <le> on pHi transients are rapidly reversible and antagonized by physiologic values of extracellular sodium activity. 
Methoxychlor and triclosan are emergent or suspected endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Methoxychlor [MXC; 1,1,1-trichlor-2,2-bis (4-methoxyphenyl) ethane] is an organochlorine pesticide that has been primarily used since dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) was banned. In addition, triclosan (<el> TCS <le>) is used as a common component of soaps, deodorants, toothpastes, and other hygiene products at concentrations up to 0.3%. In the present study, the potential impact of MXC and <el> TCS <le> on ovarian cancer cell growth and underlying mechanism(s) was examined following their treatments in BG-1 ovarian cancer cells. As results, MXC and <el> TCS <le> induced BG-1 cell growth via regulating cyclin D1, p21 and Bax genes related with cell cycle and <re> apoptosis <er>. A methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay confirmed that the proliferation of BG-1 ovarian cancer cells was stimulated by MXC (10(-6), 10(-7), 10(-8), and 10(-9)M) or <el> TCS <le> (10(-6), 10(-7), 10(-8), and 10(-9)M). Treatment of BG-1 cells with MXC or <el> TCS <le> resulted in the upregulation of cyclin D1 and downregulation of p21 and Bax transcriptions. In addition, the protein level of cyclin D1 was increased by MXC or <el> TCS <le> while p21 and Bax protein levels appeared to be reduced in these cells. Furthermore, MXC- or <el> TCS <le>-induced alterations of these genes were reversed in the presence of ICI 182,780 (10(-7)M), suggesting that the changes in these gene expressions may be regulated by an ER-dependent signaling pathway. 
We investigated modulation of excitation-contraction (<re> EC <er>) coupling by calcitonin gene-related peptide (<el> CGRP <le>), which is released by motorneurons during neuromuscular transmission. Mouse skeletal myotubes were cultured either under control conditions or in the presence of 100 nm <el> CGRP <le> ( approximately 4-72 h). T- and L-type Ca(2+) currents, immobilization resistant charge movement, and intracellular Ca(2+) transients were characterized in whole-cell patch-clamp experiments. <el> CGRP <le> treatment increased the amplitude of voltage-gated Ca(2+) release ((DeltaF/F)(max)) approximately 75-350% and moderately increased both maximal L-current conductance (G(max)) and charge movement (Q(max)). In contrast, <el> CGRP <le> treatment did not affect their corresponding voltage dependence of activation (V(1/2) and k) or T-current density. <el> CGRP <le> treatment enhanced voltage-gated Ca(2+) release in approximately 4 h, whereas the effect on L-channel magnitude took longer to develop ( approximately 24 h), suggesting that short-term potentiation of <re> EC <er> coupling may lead to subsequent long-term up-regulation of DHPR expression. <el> CGRP <le> treatment also drastically increased caffeine-induced Ca(2+) release in approximately 4 h ( approximately 400%). Thus, short-term potentiation of <re> EC <er> coupling is due to an increase in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) content. Both application of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (papaverine) and a membrane-permeant cAMP analogue (Db-cAMP) produced a similar potentiation of <re> EC <er> coupling. Conversely, this potentiation was prevented by pretreatment with either <el> CGRP <le>1 receptor antagonist (<el> CGRP <le>(8-37)) or a PKA inhibitor (H-89). Thus, <el> CGRP <le> acts through <el> CGRP <le>1 receptors and the cAMP/PKA signalling pathway to enhance voltage-gated Ca(2+) release. Effects of <el> CGRP <le> on both <re> EC <er> coupling and L-channels were attenuated at later times during myotube differentiation. 
ATP is known to be coreleased with glutamate at certain central synapses. However, the nature of its release is controversial. Here, we demonstrate that ATP release from cultured rat hippocampal neurons is sensitive to RNAi-mediated knockdown of the recently identified vesicular nucleotide <re> transport <er>er (<el> VNUT <le> or SLC17A9). In the intact brain, light microscopy showed particularly strong <el> VNUT <le> immunoreactivity in the cerebellar cortex, the olfactory bulb, and the hippocampus. Using immunoelectron microscopy, we found <el> VNUT <le> immunoreactivity colocalized with synaptic vesicles in excitatory and inhibitory terminals in the hippocampal formation. Moreover, <el> VNUT <le> immunolabeling, unlike that of the vesicular glutamate <re> transport <er>er VGLUT1, was enriched in preterminal axons and present in postsynaptic dendritic spines. Immunoisolation of synaptic vesicles indicated presence of <el> VNUT <le> in a subset of VGLUT1-containing vesicles. 
The effects of several calcium antagonists on phospholipase A2 (<re> PLA2 <er>) activity were examined. Nifedipine and nisoldipine inhibited a cell-free preparation of <re> PLA2 <er> in a dose-dependent manner with maximal inhibition of 71-77% observed at 100 microM. More potent or equipotent dihydropyridine calcium antagonists such as nitrendipine and felodipine did not inhibit <re> PLA2 <er> activity. In addition, nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists such as diltiazem, verapamil, and cinnarazine failed to reduce <re> PLA2 <er> activity markedly. Nifedipine and nisoldipine also reduced <re> PLA2 <er> activity in intact mouse peritoneal macrophages where <re> PLA2 <er> activity was monitored by free [14C]arachidonic acid release from [14C]arachidonic acid-prelabeled cells. When levels of PGE2 and LTC4 were measured by radioimmunoassay, it was found that the synthesis of these two metabolites was concomitantly inhibited by <el> nifedipine <le> and nisoldipine. In vivo, <el> nifedipine <le> and nisoldipine inhibited tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA) induced ear edema. UV irradiation of <el> nifedipine <le> and nisoldipine (which destroys the slow calcium-channel-blocking activity of these compounds) did not result in a loss of <re> PLA2 <er> inhibitory activity. In fact, in both instances the UV-irradiated forms of <el> nifedipine <le> and nisoldipine were slightly more potent <re> PLA2 <er> inhibitors than the parent compound alone. 
Epidermal homeostasis depends on a balance between self-renewal of stem cells and terminal <re> differentiation <er> of their progeny. Notch signalling is known to play a role in epidermal  stem cell patterning and <re> differentiation <er>. However, the molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate dynamic patterns of Notch ligand and receptor expression in cultured human epidermis. Notch2 and 3 act together to promote <re> differentiation <er>, while Notch1 decreases stem cell proliferation. The Notch ligand Jagged1 triggers <re> differentiation <er> when presented on an adhesive substrate or on polystyrene beads and over-rides the <re> differentiation <er> inhibitory effect of cell spreading. In contrast, Delta-like 1 (<el> Dll1 <le>) overexpression abrogates the pro-<re> differentiation <er> effect of Jagged1 in a cell autonomous fashion. 
Period circadian regulator (Per)1 and Per2 genes are involved in the molecular mechanism of the circadian clock, and exhibit tumor suppressor properties. Several studies have reported a decreased expression of Per1, Per2 and Per3 genes in different types of cancer and cancer cell lines. Promoter methylation downregulates Per1, Per2 or Per3 expression in myeloid leukemia, breast, lung, and other cancer cells; whereas histone deacetylase inhibitors (<el> HDACi <le>) upregulate Per1 or Per3 expression in certain cancer cell lines. However, the transcriptional regulation of Per1 and Per2 in cancer cells by chromatin modifications is not fully understood. The present study aimed to determine whether <el> HDACi <le> regulate Per1 and <re> Per2 expression <er> in gastric cancer cell lines, and to investigate changes in chromatin modifications in response to <el> HDACi <le>. Treatment of KATO III and NCI-N87 human gastric cancer cells with sodium butyrate (NaB) or Trichostatin A (TSA) induced Per1 and Per2 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitaion assays revealed that NaB and TSA decreased lysine 9 trimethylation on histone H3 (H3K9me3) at the Per1 promoter. TSA, but not NaB increased H3K9 acetylation at the Per2 promoter. It was also observed that binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to the Per1 promoter decreased following NaB treatment, whereas Sp1 binding increased at the Per2 promoter of NaB- and TSA-treated cells. In addition, Per1 promoter is not methylated in KATO III cells, while Per2 promoter was methylated, although NaB, TSA, and 5-Azacytidine do not change the methylated CpGs analyzed. 
In the process of developing a model of Escherichia coli <el> endotoxin <le>-induced <re> acute lung injury <er> and shock in specific pathogen-free pigs, the effects of pretreatment with metyrapone (a cortisol-synthesis inhibitor) were examined. Metyrapone was administered 1.5 h before start of <el> endotoxin <le> infusion at t = 0 h (MET-ETOX group, n = 6). At the end of the experiments (t = 4 h) a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. Control animals received only <el> endotoxin <le> (CON-ETOX group, n = 6) or metyrapone (MET-CON group, n = 4). The following results are presented as means +/- SEM. It was found that metyrapone successfully blocked endogenous cortisol synthesis (plasma cortisol levels were 41.0 +/- 5.9 nM in MET-ETOX vs. 339.0 +/- 37.7 nM in CON-ETOX at t = 4 h, P <0.01). At t = 4 h the MET-ETOX animals had substantially increased systemic hypotension compared to the CON-ETOX group (mean arterial pressure 26.7 +/- 4.3 vs. 77.7 +/- 12.2 mmHg, P <0.01), decreased dynamic lung compliance (10.9 +/- 0.7 vs. 13.7 +/- 0.6 ml/cmH2O, P <0.01), increased percentage of BAL neutrophils (28.4 +/- 6.5 vs. 6.6 +/-1.8, P <0.01), pulmonary edema (BAL total protein 0.82 +/- 0.21 vs. 0.42 +/- 0.09 mg/mL, P <0.05), elevated levels of interleukin-8 (1924 +/- 275 vs. 324 +/- 131 pg/mL, P <0.01) and acidosis (pH 7.11 +/- 0.03 vs. 7.23 +/- 0.06, P <0.05). The MET-ETOX group also showed an increased pulmonary hypertension between 2 and 3 h after start of <el> endotoxin <le> infusion and a trend toward significantly increased levels of plasma interleukin-8 (P = 0.052). Arterial pCO2, pO2/FiO2, plasma endothelin-1, plasma TNFalpha, and blood leukocytes were not markedly influenced by the plasma cortisol levels. Nitric oxide production did not seem to be altered by <el> endotoxin <le> infusion in this model, in contrast to other animal studies; this discrepancy could be thought to be due to <el> endotoxin <le>-dosage differences or species differences. 
The effects of <el> calcium <le> deficient diet and acetazolamide on the gas exchange characteristics of avian eggshells were independently investigated in two groups of unmated hens (Gallus domesticus). In one group, eggs were collected during both a normal diet (3.00% Ca) and a <el> calcium <le> deficient diet (0.34% Ca). In another group, eggs were collected both before and after acetazolamide administration (200 mg/kg) per os. Eggshell water vapor conductance (<re> GH2O <er>) increased 30% during the <el> calcium <le> deficient diet and was accompanied by a 21% decrease in eggshell thickness (L). Eggshell <re> GH2O <er> increased 200% one day after acetazolamide administration and was not only accompanied by a 36% decrease in L, but also by an 89% increase in total functional pore area (Ap). 
Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a master regulator of cellular adaptive responses to hypoxia. Levels of the HIF-1alpha subunit increase under hypoxic conditions. Exposure of cells to certain nitric oxide (<el> NO <le>) donors also induces HIF-1alpha expression under nonhypoxic conditions. We demonstrate that exposure of cells to the <el> NO <le> donor <el> NO <le>C18 or S-nitrosoglutathione induces HIF-1alpha expression and transcriptional activity. In contrast to hypoxia, <el> NO <le>C18 did not inhibit HIF-1alpha hydroxylation, ubiquitination, and degradation, indicating an effect on HIF-1alpha protein <re> synthesis <er> that was confirmed by pulse labeling studies. <el> NO <le>C18 stimulation of HIF-1alpha protein and HIF-1-dependent gene expression was blocked by treating cells with an inhibitor of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or MAPK-signaling pathway. These inhibitors also blocked <el> NO <le>C18-induced phosphorylation of the translational regulatory proteins 4E-BP1, p70 S6 kinase, and eIF-4E, thus providing a mechanism for the modulation of HIF-1alpha protein <re> synthesis <er>. In addition, expression of a dominant-negative form of Ras significantly suppressed HIF-1 activation by <el> NO <le>C18. 
Cardiovascular incidences are markedly higher in men than in pre-menstrual women. However, this advantage in women declines with aging and therefore can be correlated with the sex hormone 17β-Estradiol (E2) which is reported to protect heart cells by acting though estrogen receptors (ERs). In this study we have determined the effect of E2/ERβ against ISO induced cellular hypertrophy in H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells. The results confirm that ISO induced cardiac-hypertrophy by elevating the levels of hypertrophy associated proteins, ANP and BNP and further by upregulating p-CaMKII, <el> calcineurin <le>, p-GATA4 and NFATc3 which was correlated with a significant enlargement of the H9c2 cardiomyoblast. However, overexpression of ERβ and/or administration of E2 inhibited ISO-induced hypertrophy in H9c2 cells. In addition, E2/ERβ also inhibited ISO-induced NFATc3 translocation, and reduced the protein level of downstream marker, BNP. Furthermore, by testing with the <el> calcineurin <le> inhibitor (CsA), it was confirmed that <el> calcineurin <le> acted as a key mediator for the anti-hypertrophic effect of E2/ERβ. In cells treated with calcium blocker (BATPA), the inhibitory effect of E2/ERβ on ISO-induced Ca2+ influx and hypertrophic effects were totally blocked suggesting that E2/ERβ inhibited <el> calcineurin <le> activity to activate I-1 protein and suppress PP1, then induce PLB protein phosphorylation and activation, resulting in Ca2+ reuptake into sarcoplasmic reticulum through <re> SR Ca2+ <er> cycling modification. 
The aim of this study was to examine the effect of <el> ONO-5046 <le>, a neutrophil elastase (NE) inhibitor, on a model of <re> acute lung injury <er> induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-activated neutrophils in isolated perfused rabbit lungs. 120 min after TNFalpha (4,000 JRU/ml) was injected into the pulmonary artery (PA), 5 x 10(7) PMA-stimulated neutrophils were infused into the PA together with 1251-rabbit serum albumin (RSA). In the <el> ONO-5046 <le>-treated group (ONO), <el> ONO-5046 <le> (20 mg/kg/h) was continuously infused during the experimental period from 30 min prior to neutrophil administration. Saline, the <el> ONO-5046 <le> vehicle, was infused instead of <el> ONO-5046 <le> in the positive control group (ALD) and nonactivated neutrophils were infused without TNFalpha in the negative control group (Cont). PA pressure was monitored over a 240 min period, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed at the end of the experiment. Lung tissues were examined immunohistochemically for the expression of thrombomodulin (TM). The levels of TM in the perfusate were also measured by ELISA and the radioactivities in the BAL fluid, lung tissue and perfusate were determined to calculate the permeability index (PI) as an indicator of alveolar septal or vascular endothelial damage. The rabbit lungs infused with <el> ONO-5046 <le> showed slower and less increases in PA pressure compared with ALD group. The PI was significantly higher in ALD group (PI[BAL] = 0.028 +/- 0.014, PI[LUNG] = 0.04 +/- 0.003) than Cont (PI[BAL] = 0.002 +/- 0.001, PI[LUNG] = 0.015 +/- 0.003) and ONO group (PI[BAL] = 0.004 +/- 0.003, PI[LUNG] = 0.028 +/- 0.003 (p < 0.05). ALD group had higher TM levels in the perfusate and showed decreased expression of TM on the vascular endothelium compared to Cont and ONO group, suggesting that there was shedding of TM on endothelium and <el> ONO-5046 <le> attenuated a shedding of TM. 
Skeletal cells secrete insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) I and II and six known IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs). IGFBP-5 stimulates bone formation, and its synthesis correlates with changes in osteoblast cell growth. We tested the effects of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) <el> BB <le> on <re> IGFBP-5 expression <er> in cultures of osteoblast-enriched cells from 22-day-old fetal rat calvariae (Ob cells). Treatment of Ob cells with bFGF, TGF beta 1, and PDGF <el> BB <le> caused a time- and dose-dependent decrease in IGFBP-5 mRNA levels and inhibited IGFBP-5 polypeptide levels in the extracellular matrix. The effects of bFGF, TGF beta 1, and PDGF <el> BB <le> on IGFBP-5 transcripts were independent of cell division and were observed in the presence and absence of hydroxyurea. bFGF, TGF beta 1, and PDGF <el> BB <le> did not modify the decay of IGFBP-5 mRNA in transcriptionally arrested Ob cells, and they inhibited IGFBP-5 heterogeneous nuclear RNA and the rate of IGFBP-5 transcription. 
To investigate whether G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are involved in the regulation of the <el> PTH <le>/<el> PTH <le>rPR, we have established mutant SaOS-2 cells which stably overexpress (> 10-20-fold) a dominant negative form of the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase-1 (beta ARK-1). Acute (< or = 2 h) incubation with hPTH (1-34) induced significantly less (by up to 50%) downregulation of the <el> PTH <le>/<el> PTH <le>rPR in beta ARK-1 mutant SaOS-2 cells than observed in wild-type cells. Pretreatment of wild-type cells with <el> PTH <le> for 2 h induced homologous <re> cAMP <er> desensitisation to a second challenge with <el> PTH <le>, while the effect was blunted by up to 60% in beta ARK-1 mutant cells. 
The endogenous cathelicidin peptide <re> LL-37 <er> is strongly expressed at the wound edge early in the process of acute wound healing, but only weakly expressed in chronic wounds. Excessive proteolysis may limit the therapeutic usefulness of exogenous <re> LL-37 <er>, especially in ulcers colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa that produce elastase, which degrades <re> LL-37 <er>. This study investigated the stability of synthetic <re> LL-37 <er> against two types of proteinases in the presence or absence of wound fluid samples (diluted to 10-20%) from nine non-healing venous leg ulcers. Incubation of <re> LL-37 <er> (10 µg/ml) at 37°C for 6 h resulted in complete degradation by the serine proteinase trypsin (≥ 10 ng/ml), while no degradation was observed with <el> matrix metalloproteinase-9 <le>. <re> LL-37 <er> susceptibility to trypsin was diminished considerably in the presence of wound fluid, and there was no apparent cleavage of exogenous <re> LL-37 <er> incubated in wound fluid for up to 24 h at 37°C even when using fluids from ulcers with resident P. aeruginosa (n = 2). 
Parathyroid hormone (<el> PTH <le>) is a major stimulus for the renal production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(<re> OH <er>)2D3]. Elevated arterial blood ionized calcium ([Ca2+]) depresses serum 1,25-(<re> OH <er>)2D3 in nonparathyroidectomized rats even when serum <el> PTH <le> is maintained at high levels by infusion. However, suppression by [Ca2+] of endogenous <el> PTH <le>, causing the fall in 1,25-(<re> OH <er>)2D, cannot be excluded. To determine whether [Ca2+] regulates 1,25-(<re> OH <er>)2D3 in the absence of a variation in <el> PTH <le>, we parathyroidectomized (PTX) rats (post-PTX calcium levels less than 7.0 mg/dl), inserted arterial and venous catheters, and then replaced <el> PTH <le> using an osmotic pump. We varied [Ca2+] by infusing either 75 mM sodium chloride (control), 0.61 mumol/min of EGTA (EGTA), or calcium chloride at 0.61 mumol/min (low calcium) or 1.22 mumol/min (high calcium) for 24 h 5 days after surgery. Blood was then drawn from the rat through the arterial catheter. Compared with the control, [Ca2+] fell with EGTA, remained constant with the low-calcium infusion, and rose with the high-calcium infusion. 1,25-(<re> OH <er>)2D3 was correlated inversely with [Ca2+] in all four groups together (r = -0.635, n = 34, p less than 0.001), within the control group alone (r = -0.769, n = 11, p less than 0.002), and within the EGTA group alone (r = -0.774, n = 10, p less than 0.003). Serum phosphorus, <el> PTH <le>, and arterial blood pH were not different in any group, and none correlated with serum 1,25-(<re> OH <er>)2D3. 
The very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (<el> VLCAD <le>) enzyme catalyzes the first step of mitochondrial β-oxidation. Patients with <el> VLCAD <le> deficiency present with hypoketotic hypoglycemia and <re> cardiomyopathy <er>, which can be exacerbated by fasting and/or cold stress. Global <el> VLCAD <le> knockout mice recapitulate these phenotypes: mice develop <re> cardiomyopathy <er>, and cold exposure leads to rapid hypothermia and death. However, the contribution of different tissues to development of these phenotypes has not been studied. We generated cardiac-specific <el> VLCAD <le>-deficient (cVLCAD(-/-)) mice by Cre-mediated ablation of the <el> VLCAD <le> in cardiomyocytes. By 6 mo of age, cVLCAD(-/-) mice demonstrated increased end-diastolic and end-systolic left ventricular dimensions and decreased fractional shortening. Surprisingly, selective <el> VLCAD <le> gene ablation in cardiomyocytes was sufficient to evoke severe cold intolerance in mice who rapidly developed severe hypothermia, bradycardia, and markedly depressed cardiac function in response to fasting and cold exposure (+5°C). 
We studied the dose-response characteristics and the temporal profile of inhibition of brain nitric oxide (NO) synthase (<re> NOS <er>) elicited by i.v. administration of the <re> NOS <er> inhibitor nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (<el> L-NAME <le>). <el> L-NAME <le> was administered i.v. in awake rats equipped with a venous cannula. <el> L-NAME <le> was injected in cumulative doses of 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg and rats were sacrificed 30 min after the last dose. <re> NOS <er> catalytic activity was assayed in forebrain cytosol as the conversion of [3H]L-arginine into [3H]L-citrulline. <el> L-NAME <le> attenuated brain <re> NOS <er> activity in a dose-dependent manner but enzyme activity could not be inhibited by more than approximately 50%. After a single 20 mg/kg injection of <el> L-NAME <le> the inhibition of brain <re> NOS <er> activity was time dependent and reached a stable level at 2 hrs (52% of vehicle). Inhibition after a single injection was still present at 96 hrs, albeit to a lower magnitude. 
At hippocampal mossy fiber (MF)-st. lucidum interneuron (SLIN) synapses, mGluR7 serves as a metaplastic switch controlling bidirectional plasticity. mGluR7 activation during high-frequency stimulation (HFS) triggers presynaptic LTD due to persistent P/Q-type Ca(2+) channel inhibition. However, following mGluR7 internalization HFS produces presynaptic LTP. Surprisingly, LTP is not a simple molecular reversal of Ca(2+) channel depression. Rather, mGluR7 activation/internalization controls plasticity polarity by gating <el> cAMP <le> sensitivity of release. While naive surface mGluR7 expressing <re> MF-SLIN <er> synapses are insensitive to <el> cAMP <le> elevation, synapses that have internalized mGluR7 robustly potentiate following <el> cAMP <le> increases. Moreover, <re> MF-SLIN <er> LTP requires adenylate cyclase (AC) and protein kinase A (PKA) activities. We also discovered an association between mGluR7 and RIM1alpha, an active zone molecule required for AC/PKA-dependent presynaptic LTP. Importantly, the mGluR7-RIM1alpha interaction is regulated by mGluR7 activation, and mice lacking RIM1alpha are deficient in <re> MF-SLIN <er> LTP. 
We have measured the activation of the small GTPase <re> Ral <er> in human neutrophils after stimulation with fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP), platelet activating factor (<el> PAF <le>), and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor and compared it with the activation of two other small GTPases, Ras and Rap1. We found that fMLP and <el> PAF <le>, but not granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, induce <re> Ral <er> activation. All three stimuli induce the activation of both Ras and Rap1. Utilizing specific inhibitors we demonstrate that fMLP-induced <re> Ral <er> activation is mediated by pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins and partially by Src-like kinases, whereas fMLP-induced Ras activation is independent of Src-like kinases. <el> PAF <le>-induced <re> Ral <er> activation is mediated by pertussis toxin-insensitive proteins, Src-like kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is not involved in <el> PAF <le>-induced Ras activation. The calcium ionophore ionomycin activates <re> Ral <er>, but calcium depletion partially inhibits fMLP- and <el> PAF <le>-induced <re> Ral <er> activation, whereas Ras activation was not affected. In addition, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced activation of <re> Ral <er> is completely abolished by inhibitors of protein kinase C, whereas 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced Ras activation is largely insensitive. 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that endogenous <el> adenosine <le> modulates noradrenergic <re> neurotransmission <er> in vivo during sustained periods of sympathetic nerve stimulation associated with a reduction in tissue blood flow. This hypothesis was tested in the rat mesentery in vivo by comparing the effects of periarterial (sympathetic) nerve stimulation (PNS) on mesenteric blood flow and norepinephrine (NE) spillover from the mesentery in control rats vs. rats treated with the <el> adenosine <le> receptor antagonist 1,3-dipropyl-8-p-sulfophenylxanthine (DPSPX; 10 mg + 150 micrograms/min iv). In both control rats and rats pretreated with DPSPX, sustained PNS (7 Hz for 30 min) caused an initial large decrease in mesenteric blood flow and increase in NE spillover; however, these responses attenuated over the 30-min stimulation period. The time course of PNS-induced changes in mesenteric blood flow and NE spillover were not altered by treatment with DPSPX. However, administration of DPSPX prevented inhibition of noradrenergic <re> neurotransmission <er> in the rat mesentery by 2-chloroadenosine, which indicated that an effective level of DPSPX was achieved. 
Bile acid sequestrants have been shown to lower <re> glucose levels <er> in patients with type 2 diabetes. To investigate how colesevelam (<el> CL <le>) HCl improves hyperglycemia, studies were conducted in diet-induced obesity (F-DIO) rats, which develop insulin resistance when fed a high-energy (high fat/high sucrose) diet (HE). The rats were fed HE; HE + 2% <el> CL <le>; HE + 0.02% SC-435 (SC), an apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter inhibitor; and regular chow (controls). After 4 wk of treatment, both in the HE group and the SC + HE group, plasma glucose and insulin levels remained elevated compared with baseline values throughout an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). In contrast, in the <el> CL <le> + HE group, plasma <re> glucose levels <er> returned to baseline by the end of the test, and insulin peaked in 15-30 min and then returned to baseline. <el> CL <le> induced release of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) because the area under the curve of plasma total GLP-1 in the <el> CL <le> + HE group was significantly greater than in the HE group during the OGTT. Bile acid concentrations in the portal blood did not decrease in the HE group but declined significantly both in the <el> CL <le> + HE and SC + HE groups with reduced farnesoid X receptor activation compared with controls. 
Repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is predominantly mediated by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) in mammalian cells. NHEJ requires binding of the Ku70-<el> Ku80 <le> heterodimer (Ku70/80) to the DNA ends and subsequent recruitment of the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PK(CS)) and the XRCC4/ligase IV complex. Activation of the DNA-PK(CS) serine/threonine kinase requires an interaction with Ku70/80 and is essential for NHEJ-mediated DSB repair. In contrast to previous models, we found that the carboxy terminus of <el> Ku80 <le> is not absolutely required for the recruitment and activation of DNA-PK(CS) at DSBs, although cells that harbored a carboxy-terminal deletion in the <el> Ku80 <le> gene were sensitive to ionizing radiation and showed reduced end-joining capacity. More detailed analysis of this repair defect showed that <re> DNA-PK(CS) autophosphorylation <er> at Thr2647 was diminished, while Ser2056 was phosphorylated to normal levels. This resulted in severely reduced levels of Artemis nuclease activity in vivo and in vitro. 
Effects of intravenous yohimbine and atipamezole on haemodynamics and electrocardiogram (<re> ECG <er>) were studied after lumbosacral subarachnoid administration of <el> medetomidine <le> in eight goats. All goats received lumbosacral subarachnoid <el> medetomidine <le> at a dosage of 0.01 mg/kg followed by yohimbine (0.25 mg/kg) or atipamezole (0.005 mg/kg) intravenously 45 min after administration of <el> medetomidine <le>, in a randomized crossover design, in right lateral recumbency keeping a gap of 1 week between each trial. Heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature, mean arterial pressure (MAP), mean central venous pressure (MCVP) and <re> ECG <er> were determined. Goats were observed for sedation and urination. All goats showed sedation and depression after <el> medetomidine <le> administration became alert within 2-5 min after reversal. Bradycardia and bradypnoea were the consistent findings after <el> medetomidine <le> injection. Tachycardia and tachypnoea were recorded within 2-5 min after reversal in both groups. A decrease in MAP and an increase in MCVP were seen after <el> medetomidine <le> administration in both groups. Effects of yohimbine and atipamezole on the reversal of MAP and MCVP were more or less the same and statistically non-significant (P > 0.05) in all animals. The <re> ECG <er> changes were non-significant (P > 0.05) in both groups. 
The fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra of model indole compounds and of cod <re> parvalbumin <er> III, a protein containing a single tryptophan and no tyrosine, were examined in the time scale ranging from subnanoseconds to milliseconds at 25 degrees C in aqueous buffer. For both <el> Ca <le>- bound and <el> Ca <le>-free <re> parvalbumin <er> and for model indole compounds that contained a proton donor, a phosphorescent species emitting at 450 nm with a lifetime of approximately 20-40 ns could be identified. A longer-lived phosphorescence is also apparent; it has approximately the same absorption and emission spectrum as the short-lived triplet molecule. For <el> Ca <le> <re> parvalbumin <er>, the decay of the long-lived triplet tryptophan is roughly exponential with a lifetime of 4.7 ms at 25 degrees C whereas for N-acetyltryptophanamide in aqueous buffer the decay lifetime was 30 microseconds. In contrast, the lifetime of the long-lived tryptophan species is much shorter in the <el> Ca <le>-free protein compared with <el> Ca <le> <re> parvalbumin <er>, and the decay shows complex nonexponential kinetics over the entire time range from 100 ns to 1 ms. 
In a previous study, moxifloxacin was shown to ameliorate immunosuppression and enhance cytokine production in several tissues, including the lungs of cyclophosphamide-injected <el> mice <le>. We examined here the effects of moxifloxacin on Candida albicans lung <re> infection <er> in cyclophosphamide-injected <el> mice <le>. Mice were injected on day 0 with 250 mg of cyclophosphamide/kg, and on days 1 to 4 they were given moxifloxacin at 22.5 mg/kg/day compared to controls given ceftazidime at 75 mg/kg/day or saline. On day 6, C. albicans (10 7 CFU/mouse) was inoculated intratracheally, and animals were observed for the development of bronchopneumonia, weight loss, mortality, the presence of C. albicans, and lung cytokine production. Histopathology on day 10 postinoculation revealed bronchopneumonia in 50, 67, and 0% of saline-, ceftazidime-, and moxifloxacin-treated <el> mice <le>, respectively (P < 0.05). The mortality rates were 28, 17, and 5%, respectively (P < 0.05), and weight loss occurred at 20, 32, and 0%, respectively (P < 0.05). By day 15, C. albicans was eliminated from all moxifloxacin-treated <el> mice <le> but was still isolated from lung homogenates of 50 to 60% of the saline- and ceftazidime-treated groups. Among the cytokines tested on days 0 to 15, we found an increased production of tumor necrosis factor alpha, KC (functional interleukin-8), and gamma interferon in the lungs of ceftazidime- and saline-treated controls compared to the moxifloxacin pretreatment that abolished their secretion. 
Clinically available anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) biologics, which inhibit both soluble (sTNF) and transmembrane forms (<el> tmTNF <le>) of TNF, eliminating all TNF signalling, have successfully treated autoimmune diseases including uveitis. These have potentially serious side effects such as reactivation of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis and, therefore, more specific inhibition of TNF signalling pathways may maintain clinical efficacy while reducing adverse effects. To determine the effects of specific pharmacological inhibition of sTNF on <re> macrophage activation <er> and migration, we used a mouse model of uveitis (experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis; EAU). We show that selective inhibition of sTNF is sufficient to suppress EAU by limiting inflammatory CD11b(+) macrophages and CD4(+) T cell migration into the eye. However, inhibition of both sTNF and <el> tmTNF <le> is required to inhibit interferon-γ-induced chemokine receptor 2, CD40, major histocompatibility complex class II and nitric oxide (NO) up-regulation, and signalling via <el> tmTNF <le> is sufficient to mediate tissue damage. In confirmation, intravitreal inhibition of sTNF alone did not suppress disease, and inflammatory cells that migrated into the eye were activated, generating NO, thus causing structural damage to the retina. In contrast, intravitreal inhibition of both sTNF and <el> tmTNF <le> suppressed <re> macrophage activation <er> and therefore disease. 
The mechanism underlying epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition (<re> EMT <er>) caused by high glucose (<el> HG <le>) stimulation in diabetic nephropathy (DN) remains to be fully elucidated. The present study investigated the effects of <el> HG <le> on <re> EMT <er> and the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK‑3β) in podocytes and the kidneys of db/db mice, and assessed the effects of (2'Z, 3'E)‑6‑bromoindirubin‑3'‑oxime (BIO), an inhibitor of GSK‑3β, on <re> EMT <er> and glomerular injury. The resulting data showed that the activity of GSK‑3β was upregulated by <el> HG <le> and downregulated by BIO in the podocytes and the renal cortex. The expression levels of epithelial markers, including nephrin, podocin and synaptopodin, were decreased by <el> HG <le> and increased by BIO, whereas the reverse were true for mesenchymal markers, including α‑smooth muscle actin (α‑SMA) and fibronectin. The expression levels of β‑catenin and Snail, in contrast to current understanding of the Wnt signaling pathway, were increased by <el> HG <le> and decreased by BIO. In addition, expression of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) was decreased by <el> HG <le> and increased by BIO. 
Dynorphin A(1-13) administered intrathecally to rats induces a reversible hindlimb <re> paralysis <er> and permanent loss of the tail-flick reflex in a dose-dependent and all-or-none manner. The loss of the tail-flick reflex has been determined to result from neurotoxicity linked to the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Recently, it has been reported that NMDA antagonists attenuate irreversible <re> paralysis <er> induced by <el> dynorphin <le> A(1-17) and <el> dynorphin <le> A(2-17). In the present studies, we examined whether repeated injections of <el> dynorphin <le> A(1-13) acetate salt could change the characteristics of the reversible <re> paralysis <er>. Injections repeated every 48 h resulted in hindlimb <re> paralysis <er> upon each injection which was not different in terms of magnitude or duration (P greater than 0.60). Injections repeated at 2 h intervals resulted in desensitization of the paralytic effects (P less than 0.05). We also examined if strychnine sulfate, a glycine antagonist would alter the paralytic response to <el> dynorphin <le>. Strychnine protected rats from <re> paralysis <er> (P less than 0.01) and loss of the tail-flick reflex with an ED50 of 7 nmol. We conclude that the reversible <re> paralysis <er> induced by <el> dynorphin <le> A(1-13) is repeatable which suggests that the <re> paralysis <er> results from nontoxic or subtoxic actions of <el> dynorphin <le>. Desensitization to the paralytic effects occurs with closely spaced injections by some unknown mechanism. 
Antibodies against the COOH-terminal domain of cell surface GRP78 induce <re> apoptosis <er> in cancer cell lines via activation of <el> p53 <le> signaling. We now have studied the effects of PFT-alpha, an inhibitor of <el> p53 <le>-mediated apoptotic pathways, on anti-GRP78 antibody-induced activation of <el> p53 <le> and pro-apoptotic signaling in 1-LN prostate cancer cells. Pretreatment of 1-LN cancer cells with this agent significantly inhibited antibody or doxorubicin-induced upregulation of <el> p53 <le>. Concomitantly, PFT-alpha treatment prevented down regulation of ERK1/2 activation by either antibody or doxorubicin. Likewise, PFT-alpha prevented increases in the pro-apoptotic proteins BAD, BAK, BAX, PUMA, and NOXA as well as activation of caspases-3, -7, and -9. 
The effects of continuous or acute administration of <el> insulin <le> or <el> insulin <le>-like growth factor-I (<re> IGF-I <er>) on <re> IGF-I <er> mRNA and <re> IGF-I <er> receptor mRNA were studied in the skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius), heart muscle and vascular smooth muscle (aorta) of non-diabetic and diabetic rats using a solution hybridization assay. The levels of <re> IGF-I <er> mRNA in the different types of muscle markedly decreased by diabetes, whereas changes in <re> IGF-I <er> receptor mRNA were less consistent. Continuous infusion of diabetic rats with <el> insulin <le> (28 or 35 nmol/day) for 4 days normalized the altered levels of <re> IGF-I <er> mRNA and IGF-1 receptor mRNA. Infusion of equimolar concentrations of <re> IGF-I <er> did not affect <re> IGF-I <er> mRNA, but decreased the level of <re> IGF-I <er> receptor mRNA in skeletal muscle. In acute experiments, rats were injected with equipotent blood glucose-lowering doses of <el> insulin <le> (14 nmol) or <re> IGF-I <er> (107 nmol). Insulin did not significantly affect levels of <re> IGF-I <er> mRNA, but decreased levels of <re> IGF-I <er> receptor mRNA in skeletal muscle and aorta. <re> IGF-I <er> increased levels of <re> IGF-I <er> mRNA in heart muscle, and markedly decreased levels of <re> IGF-I <er> receptor mRNA in skeletal muscle and heart muscle from non-diabetic and diabetic rats. 
Interferon-gamma (<el> IFNgamma <le>) is an immunomodulating cytokine that has profound effects on reproductive function. <el> IFNgamma <le> inhibits <re> steroidogenesis <er> both in vivo and in vitro. The mechanism by which <el> IFNgamma <le> inhibits Leydig cell <re> steroidogenesis <er> remains unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of <el> IFNgamma <le> on the expression and regulation of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) gene in primary cultures of rat Leydig cells. StAR facilitates the efficient production of steroid hormone by regulating the translocation of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, the site of the cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage (P450scc) enzyme system that converts cholesterol to pregnenolone. <el> IFNgamma <le> inhibited hCG-induced StAR messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in a dose-dependent manner. The addition of <el> IFNgamma <le> in a concentration of 500 U/ml decreased hCG-induced 3.8- and 1.7-kilobase StAR mRNA by 78% and 70%, respectively. <el> IFNgamma <le> also reduced hCG-stimulated P450scc mRNA levels by 69%. The inhibitory effects of <el> IFNgamma <le> on StAR mRNA levels were confirmed by ribonuclease protection assay. As early as 12 h after the addition of <el> IFNgamma <le>, hCG-induced StAR mRNA levels decreased by more than 44%. To evaluate the effects of <el> IFNgamma <le> on StAR protein levels, Western blot analyses were performed. hCG in a concentration of 10 ng/ml increased StAR protein by 5.6-fold. Treatment of Leydig cells with <el> IFNgamma <le> (500 U/ml) decreased hCG-induced StAR protein by 44%. In contrast, interleukin-1 and murine tumor necrosis factor-alpha reduced hCG-induced P450scc mRNA expression without inhibiting StAR mRNA or protein levels. 
The mechanism of inhibition of <re> cytochrome <er> P-450-dependent mixed function oxidation by ethanol was studied. Ethanol competitively inhibited the binding of hexobarbital to liver microsomes, and increased the low spin signal of <re> cytochrome <er> P-450 in the electron spin resonance spectra. Therefore, ethanol decreased the substrates bound to ferric <re> cytochrome <er> P-450 in the first step of mixed function oxidation. The second step of mixed function oxidation is the reduction of ferric <re> cytochrome <er> P-450-substrate complex by <el> NADPH-<re> cytochrome <er> P-450 reductase <le>. The NADPH-dependent reduction of liver microsomal <re> cytochrome <er> P-450 was biphasic and composed of two first-order reactions. Ethanol decreased the rate constants of the fast and slow phases of microsomal <re> cytochrome <er> P-450 reduction. 
On vascular endothelial growth factor (<el> VEGF <le>) stimulation, both <el> VEGF <le> R1 and R2 receptors were phosphorylated in ovine fetoplacental artery endothelial (oFPAE) cells. Treatment with <el> VEGF <le> stimulated both time- and dose-dependent activation of <re> ERK2/1 <er> in oFPAE cells. <el> VEGF <le>-induced <re> ERK2/1 <er> activation was mediated by <el> VEGF <le>R2, but not <el> VEGF <le>R1, and was linked to intracellular calcium, protein kinase C, and Raf-1. <el> VEGF <le> stimulated oFPAE cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation in vitro. Blockade of <re> ERK2/1 <er> pathway attenuated <el> VEGF <le>-induced cell proliferation and tube formation but failed to inhibit migration in oFPAE cells. Disruption of caveolae by cholesterol depletion with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin or by down-regulation of its structural protein caveolin-1 blunted <el> VEGF <le>-induced <re> ERK2/1 <er> activation, proliferation, and tube formation in oFPAE cells, indicating an essential role of integral caveolae in these <el> VEGF <le>-induced responses. Adenoviral overexpression of caveolin-1 and addition of a caveolin scaffolding domain peptide also inhibited <el> VEGF <le>-stimulated <re> ERK2/1 <er> activation, cell proliferation, and tube formation in oFPAE cells. Furthermore, molecules comprising the <re> ERK2/1 <er> signaling module, including <el> VEGF <le>R2, protein kinase Calpha, Raf-1, MAPK kinase 1/2, and <re> ERK2/1 <er>, resided with caveolin-1 in caveolae. <el> VEGF <le> transiently stimulated <re> ERK2/1 <er> activation in the caveolae similarly as in intact cells. Caveolae disruption greatly diminished <re> ERK2/1 <er> activation by <el> VEGF <le> in oFPAE cell caveolae. 
To investigate the modulatory role of <el> IFN-gamma <le> on the induction and maintenance of Th2 mucosal immunity in vivo, experiments were performed in mice lacking the <el> IFN-gamma <le> R. Aerosol OVA challenge of immunized wild-type mice resulted in an <re> infiltration <er> of eosinophils into the lung, associated with the ex vivo production of Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-5) from purified lung Thy1.2+ cells stimulated via the CD3/TCR complex. However, while immunized <el> IFN-gamma <le> R-deficient mice exhibited elevated levels of IgE, IgG1, and reduced levels of IgG2a compared with wild-type mice, there was no difference in the recruitment of eosinophils into the lung or the production of IL-4 and IL-5 from lung T cells on day 3. In contrast, up to 2 mo after a single Ag challenge, eosinophils were still present in the lungs of <el> IFN-gamma <le> R-deficient, but not wild-type, mice. Likewise, lung-derived T cells from <el> IFN-gamma <le> R-deficient mice produced higher levels of IL-4 and IL-5, both at 1 and 2 mo after OVA challenge compared with T cells from wild-type mice. 
To explore the effects of <el> FK506 <le> on the inhibition by triptolide (TP) of cell proliferation and expressions of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and their inducing products <re> PGE2 <er>, NO in human rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASF), and to study the mechanisms of combination of <el> FK506 <le> and TP in RA therapy, RASF used in the experiments were obtained from synovial tissue of patients with RA and were cultured. RASF were pretreated with <el> FK506 <le>(10-1000 nmol/L)for 2 h, then the cells were stimulated with TNF alpha(20 microg/L) in the presence or absence of TP (10 microg/L). The RASF proliferation was determined by [(3)H]-TdR incorporation, and the productions of <re> PGE2 <er> and NO in culture supernatants of RASF were detected with competitive ELISA and enzyme reduction of nitrate. Expression of COX-2 and iNOS mRNA in RASF were analyzed by semi quantitative RT-PCR. Expressions of COX-2 and iNOS protein were estimated by Western blot method and cellular enzyme immunoassay in synovial fibroblasts. NF-kappa B activity in whole-cell extract of RASF was also measured by an ELISA-based method. Results showed that neither <el> FK506 <le> nor TP at lower concentration (10 microg/L) alone affected TNF alpha-induced COX-2, iNOS expression and production of <re> PGE2 <er>, NO in synovial cells. Combined treatment of <el> FK506 <le> and a lower concentration of TP (10 microg/L) down-regulated COX-2 and iNOS mRNA and protein expression, and their inducing products <re> PGE2 <er> and NO of synovial fibroblasts. This effect was positively correlated with <el> FK506 <le> concentrations (10-1000 nmol/L). NF-kappa B activity in TNF alpha-stimulated synovial cells was suppressed more profoundly by <el> FK506 <le> plus TP (10 microg/L) treatment than those with TP (10 microg/L) alone. No change was observed in inhibition of proliferation of synovial cells after combined treatment of <el> FK506 <le> and TP. 
The Chinese herbal granule Tangshen Formula (TSF) has been proven to decrease proteinuria and improve estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) patients. However, the underlying mechanism of TSF on treatment of diabetic nephropathy (DN) remains unclear. The present study aimed to identify the therapeutic target of TSF in diabetic renal injuries through microarray-based gene expression profiling and establish its underlying mechanism. TSF treatment significantly attenuated diabetic renal injuries by inhibiting urinary excretion of albumin and renal histological injuries in diabetic (db/db) mice. We found that <el> PLZF <le> might be the molecular target of TSF in DN. In vivo, the db/db mice showed a significant increase in renal protein expression of <el> PLZF <le> and collagen III, and decrease in renal <re> autophagy <er> levels (downregulated LC3 II and upregulated p62/SQSTM1) compared to db/m mice. The application of TSF resulted in the downregulation of <el> PLZF <le> and collagen III and upregulation of <re> autophagy <er> level in the kidneys of db/db mice. In vitro, TSF reduced high glucose (HG)-induced cell proliferation for NRK52E cells. Further studies indicated that the exposure of NRK52E cells to high levels of glucose resulted in the downregulation of cellular <re> autophagy <er> and upregulation of collagen III protein, which was reversed by TSF treatment by decreasing <el> PLZF <le> expression. 
Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a lipid growth factor with multiple biological functions and has been shown to stimulate cancer cell secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (<el> VEGF-A <le>) and trigger <re> angiogenesis <er>. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a heterodimer consisting of HIF-1α and HIF-1β (also known as aromatic hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT)) subunits, is an important regulator of <re> angiogenesis <er> in prostate cancer (PC) through the enhancement of <el> VEGF-A <le> expression. In this study, we first confirmed the ability of LPA to induce <el> VEGF-A <le> expression in PC-3 cells and then validated that LPA-induced <el> VEGF-A <le> expression was regulated by HIF-1α and ARNT through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation. Aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a receptor for dioxin-like compounds, functions as a transcription factor through dimerization with ARNT and was found to inhibit prostate carcinogenesis and vanadate-induced <el> VEGF-A <le> production. Since ARNT is a common dimerization partner of AHR and HIF-1α, we hypothesized that AHR might suppress LPA-induced <el> VEGF-A <le> expression in PC-3 cells by competing with HIF-1α for ARNT. Here we demonstrated that overexpression and ligand activation of AHR inhibited HIF-1-mediated <el> VEGF-A <le> induction by LPA treatment of PC-3 cells. 
Cytokines may contribute to beta-cell apoptosis in the early stages of type 1 diabetes mellitus. It has been reported recently that interleukin-1 beta (<el> IL-1 beta <le>) induces activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) p38 and <re> ERK1/2 <er> in neonatal rat islets. Since these kinases may participate in cytokine-induced apoptosis, we evaluated whether cytokines induce activation of MAPKs in FACS-purified primary rat beta-cells, and whether blockers of p38 and/or <re> ERK1/2 <er> prevent beta-cell death. <el> IL-1 beta <le>, but not interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), caused phosphorylation of the substrates Elk-1, ATF-2 and hsp25, and the phosphorylation of both Elk-1 and hsp25 were decreased by the p38 blocker SB203580 (p38i) and the MAPK/ERK blocker PD 098059 (MEKi). When added together, p38i and MEKi decreased <el> IL-1 beta <le>-induced nitrite production over 24 hours by 60%, but did not affect <el> IL-1 beta <le>-induced manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) mRNA expression. To test the effects of MAPK inhibitors on beta-cell death by necrosis or apoptosis, these cells were exposed for 6 or 9 days to <el> IL-1 beta <le> + IFN-gamma. This treatment induced cell death, mostly by apoptosis. The MEKi, but not the p38i, significantly decreased cytokine-induced apoptosis, thus decreasing the total number of dead cells. This protection was only partial, suggesting that <re> ERK1/2 <er> activation is not the only mechanism by which cytokines induce beta-cell apoptosis. 
The flexible heteroarotinoids (Flex-Het) represent a novel type of atypical retinoids lacking activity in binding to and transactivating retinoid receptors. Preclinical studies have shown that Flex-Hets induce <re> apoptosis <er> of cancer cells while sparing normal cells and exhibit anticancer activity in vivo with improved therapeutic ratios over conventional retinoid receptor agonists. Flex-Hets have been shown to induce <re> apoptosis <er> through activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. The present study has revealed a novel mechanism underlying Flex-Het-induced <re> apoptosis <er> involving induction of death receptor 5 (DR5). The representative Flex-Het <el> SHetA2 <le> effectively inhibited the growth of human lung cancer cells in cell culture and in mice. <el> SHetA2 <le> induced <re> apoptosis <er>, which could be abrogated by silencing caspase-8 expression, indicating that ShetA2 triggers a caspase-8-dependent <re> apoptosis <er>. Accordingly, <el> SHetA2 <le> up-regulated DR5 expression, including cell surface levels of DR5, and augmented tumor necrosis factor-related <re> apoptosis <er>-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced <re> apoptosis <er>. Importantly, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated blockade of DR5 induction conferred cell resistance to <el> SHetA2 <le>-induced <re> apoptosis <er>, as well as <el> SHetA2 <le>/TRAIL-induced <re> apoptosis <er>. These results show that DR5 induction is a key component of <re> apoptosis <er> induced by <el> SHetA2 <le> or by <el> SHetA2 <le> combined with TRAIL. <el> SHetA2 <le> exerted CAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP)-dependent transactivation of the DR5 promoter. Consistently, <el> SHetA2 <le> induced CHOP expression, which paralleled DR5 up-regulation, whereas siRNA-mediated blockage of CHOP induction prevented DR5 up-regulation, indicating CHOP-dependent DR5 up-regulation by <el> SHetA2 <le>. 
Neuronal membrane enzyme activities were determined in naive and <el> ethanol <le>-treated (30 min after 2 g/kg) male and female rats of lines developed for more (ANT) and less (AT) <el> ethanol <le>-induced motor impairment. Ethanol did not affect acetylcholinesterase, (Na+K)-ATPase or 5'-nucleotidase activities, but <re> adenylate cyclase <er> activities were lowered in both cerebellum and cerebrum. Cerebral acetylcholinesterase activities were higher in ANT than AT rats. No consistent line difference was observed regarding (Na+K)-ATPase activities. Slightly higher cerebellar 5'-nucleotidase activities were found in the ANT line. Cerebellar <re> adenylate cyclase <er> levels were substantially higher in the AT line. No line differences were displayed in the activation of <re> adenylate cyclase <er> activity by dopamine or norepinephrine. 
B7-H3 is a glycoprotein overexpressed in cancer, but its functional contribution in this setting remains poorly understood. In the present study, we identified that the overexpression of B7-H3 in lung cancer resulted in aberrant <re> lipid metabolism <er> via <el> SREBP-1 <le>/FASN signaling pathway. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays revealed that approximately 80.4% (37/46) of lung cancer tissues were positive for B7-H3 accompanying poor prognosis. Notably, Oil red O staining and total triglyceride assay exhibited that down-regulation of B7-H3 decreased lipid synthesis in lung cancer A549 and H446 cell lines. Mechanistic investigations showed that B7-H3 modulated the expression of FASN, a fatty acid synthase, specifically. Furthermore, deletion of B7-H3 down-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of <el> SREBP-1 <le>, a transcription factor governing the expression of FASN. Finally, correlation analysis between expression levels of B7-H3 and FASN exhibited a positive correlation in clinical lung cancer tissues. 
Rat pancreatic lobules were used to investigate the interaction of gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), carbachol, <el> glucose <le>, and an amino acid mixture on <re> insulin secretion <er>. At 5 mM <el> glucose <le>, GIP (1.1 ng/ml) did not augment <re> insulin secretion <er> in the presence or absence of carbachol (5 X 10(-5)M) during a 210-min incubation. However, at 11 mM <el> glucose <le>, GIP did augment <re> insulin secretion <er> in the presence (342.5 +/- 62.0 vs. 212.5 +/- 50.5 microU . ml-1 . mg tissue-1, mean +/- SE; P less than 0.01) but not the absence (217.0 +/- 45.5 vs. 205.8 +/- 35.0 microU . ml-1 . mg tissue-1) of carbachol. During subsequent 30-min incubations, GIP was increased to a supra-physiological concentration of 11 ng/ml and again augmented <re> insulin secretion <er> with (65.8 +/- 10.8 vs. 27.8 +/- 2.4 microU . ml-1 . mg tissue-1 . h-1; P less than 0.001) but not without (37.2 +/- 1.8 vs. 30.2 +/- 2 microU . ml-1 . mg-1 tissue-1 . h-1) carbachol present. This GIP-mediated <re> insulin secretion <er> was blocked by atropine (34.8 to 1.8 vs. 37.6 +/- 1.6 microU . ml-1 . mg tissue-1 . h-1). At amino acid concentrations of 21 and 211 mM, but not 2.1 mM, GIP augmented insulin release but again only with carbachol present. 
Protein secretion by the caput epididymidis has been examined in vitro using radioactive methionine as a precursor for protein synthesis. Newly synthesized and secreted proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis and visualized by fluorography. Local anesthetics such as procaine had the ability to reduce the secretion of some, but not all, proteins. Selective inhibition of secretion of the same proteins occurred when either dihydrocytochalasin B, monensin, ouabain, or <el> dinitrophenol <le> was added to the medium, or when the concentration of glucose was reduced below 1 mM. Calcium ionophore also selectively modified <re> protein secretion <er>, but the proteins affected were different from those influenced by local anesthetics. Other agents tested (eg, adrenergic and cholinergic agonists and antagonists, sodium pentobarbitone, antipsychotic drugs, cyclic AMP, colchicine) did not selectively modify <re> protein secretion <er>, even though overall protein synthesis and secretion was reduced in some instances. Procaine and dihydrocytochalasin B also reduced glucose utilization by epididymal tissue and it is suggested that these agents may reduce <re> protein secretion <er> by limiting the supply of energy for the exocytotic process. 
High levels of the triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) have been identified as independent risk factors for coronary heart disease, and inflammation is thought to contribute to atherosclerosis and its complications. To understand how dyslipidemia promotes inflammation, we have characterised the effects of VLDL treatment on production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) by human monocyte-derived macrophages. VLDL strongly potentiated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of TNF mRNA and secretion of TNF protein. VLDL activated mitogen-activated protein kinase-ERK kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2), and potentiated LPS-induced MEK1/2 activation. The MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 strongly diminished <re> TNF expression <er>, indicating that MEK1/2 plays a central role in the regulation of <re> TNF expression <er>. VLDL did not activate transcription factors NF-kappaB and PPAR-gamma, but it activated <el> AP-1 <le> at least as potently as LPS, and potentiated LPS-induced activation of <el> AP-1 <le>. The inhibitor U0126 completely prevented this potentiation. Inhibition of <el> AP-1 <le> by decoy oligonucleotides abolished potentiation of TNF secretion by VLDL. 
Small noncoding RNA molecules (miRNA) regulate protein levels in a post-transcriptional manner by partial base pairing to the 3'-UTR of target genes thus mediating degradation or translational repression. Previous studies indicate that numerous miRNA regulate the biosynthesis of intraovarian hormones, and emerging evidence indicates that one of these, miRNA-221 (<el> MIR221 <le>), may be a modulator of ovarian function. However, the hormonal control of ovarian <el> MIR221 <le> is not known. The objectives of this study were to investigate the developmental and hormonal regulation of <el> MIR221 <le> expression in granulosa (GC) and theca cell (TC) and its possible role in regulating follicular function. Bovine ovaries were collected from a local abattoir and GC and TC were obtained from small (<6 mm) and large (≥8 mm) follicles. In Exp. 1, GCs of small follicles had 9.7-fold greater (P < 0.001) levels of <el> MIR221 <le> than those of large follicles, and TCs of large follicles had 3.7-fold greater (P < 0.001) levels of <el> MIR221 <le> than those of small follicles. In large follicles, abundance of <el> MIR221 <le> was 66.6-fold greater (P < 0.001) in TCs than in GCs. In small follicles, <el> MIR221 <le> abundance did not differ (P = 0.14) between GC and TCs. In vitro Exp. 2, 3, and 4 revealed that treatment of bovine TCs with various steroids, phytoestrogens, IGF1, forskolin, and dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate had no effect (P > 0.35) on <el> MIR221 <le> expression, whereas treatment with fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) and FGF2 increased (P < 0.001) TC <el> MIR221 <le> abundance 1.7- to 2.5-fold. In Exp. 5, FGF9 increased (P < 0.05) GC <el> MIR221 <le> abundance by 1.7- and 2.0-fold in small and large follicles, respectively. The role of <el> MIR221 <le> in GC <re> steroidogenesis <er> was investigated in Exp. 6 and it was found that transfection with a <el> MIR221 <le> mimic reduced (P < 0.01) GC estradiol and progesterone production induced by FSH and IGF1, whereas transfection with <el> MIR221 <le> inhibitor had little or no effect. 
Transformation is accompanied by the down-regulation of the high molecular weight isoforms of non-muscle tropomyosin. Several lines of evidence suggest that tropomyosin down-regulation may be essential for <el> ras <le>-induced tumorigenicity. It is unclear which of the many signaling pathways downstream of Ras are involved in tropomyosin down-regulation. Here we demonstrate that <re> Raf <er> activation induces tropomyosin down-regulation comparable to that induced by Ras. Expression of the effector-domain mutant Ras-G12V,Y40C, which is unable to bind <re> Raf <er>, induced only modest down-modulation of tropomyosin. Treatment with the MEK-specific inhibitor PD98059 had little effect on tropomyosin levels in <el> ras <le>- or raf-transformed cells. In contrast, a mutant form of MEK-1, MEK-1-S218A,S222A, restored tropomyosin levels in <el> ras <le>-transformed NIH3T3 cells almost to the levels observed in non-transformed cells. MEK-1-S218A,S222A does not inhibit MEK phosphorylation and is a poor inhibitor of ERK phosphorylation. These data suggest that this mutant form of MEK-1 interferes with a yet uncharacterized pathway controlled by <re> Raf <er>. 
The <re> Ca <er>(2+) sensitizer levosimendan (<el> LEV <le>) improves myocardial contractility by enhancing the sensitivity of the contractile apparatus to <re> Ca <er>(2+). In addition, <el> LEV <le> promotes <re> Ca <er>(2+) entry through L-type channels in human cardiac myocytes. In this study, which was performed using microdialysis, infusion of <el> LEV <le> at 0.25 microM for 160 min increased dopamine (DA) concentrations (up to fivefold baseline) in dialysates from the striatum of freely moving rats. <re> Ca <er>(2+) omission from the perfusion fluid abolished baseline DA release and greatly decreased <el> LEV <le>-induced DA release. Reintroduction of <re> Ca <er>(2+) in the perfusion fluid restored <el> LEV <le>-induced DA release. Chelation of intracellular <re> Ca <er>(2+) by co-infusing 1,2-bis (o-amino-phenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetra (acetoxymethyl) ester (BAPTA-AM, 0.2 mM) did not affect basal DA release and scarcely affected <el> LEV <le>-induced increases in dialysate DA. In addition, co-infusion of the L-type (<re> Ca <er>(v) 1.1-1.3) voltage-sensitive <re> Ca <er>(2+)-channel inhibitor nifedipine failed to inhibit <el> LEV <le>-induced increases in dialysate DA, which, in contrast, was inhibited by co-infusion of the N-type (<re> Ca <er>(v) 2.2) voltage-sensitive <re> Ca <er>(2+)-channel inhibitor omega-conotoxin GVIA. 
We attempted to mimic septic conditions in vitro by using a model of isolated perfused rabbit lung (IPRL) and evaluated the effects of endotoxin or endotoxin-induced mediators (or both) on it. Moreover, we determined the salutary effects of HWA 138, a new xanthine derivative, against endotoxin-related <re> lung injury <er>. To study this, heparinized human blood was centrifuged, following which the plasma complement was inactivated by heat treatment and the isolated and washed buffy coat cells were then added to it. This was followed by incubation of aliquot suspension with and without endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [<el> LPS <le>], 100 ng/ml) at 37 degrees C for 2 hours. Plasma was then harvested and is referred to as sepsis-like plasma (SLP). Control plasma (CP) was not exposed to <el> LPS <le>. IPRLs were then perfused with SLP, CP, <el> LPS <le> itself, or both <el> LPS <le> and CP without additional white blood cells. Endotoxin itself did not induce any changes in the presence or in the absence of control plasma; however, sepsis-like plasma led to the development of lung edema, as evidenced by significantly elevated lung water and pulmonary artery pressure. Administration of HWA 138 before the addition of SLP prevented the SLP-induced <re> lung injury <er>. 
Accumulating evidence suggests that hyperbaric oxygen (<el> HBO <le>) stimulates neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) activity, but the influence on endothelial NOS (eNOS) activity and vascular NO bioavailability remains unclear. We used a bioassay employing rat aortic rings to evaluate vascular NO bioavailability. <el> HBO <le> exposure to 2.8 atm absolute (ATA) in vitro decreased ACh relaxation. This effect remained unchanged, despite treatment with SOD-polyethylene glycol and catalase-polyethylene glycol, suggesting that the reduction in endothelium-derived NO bioavailability was independent of <re> superoxide <er> production. In vitro <el> HBO <le> induced contraction of resting aortic rings with and without endothelium, and these contractions were reduced by the NOS inhibitor N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine. In addition, in vitro <el> HBO <le> attenuated the vascular contraction produced by norepinephrine, and this effect was reversed by N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine, but not by endothelial denudation. These findings indicate stimulation of extraendothelial NO production during <el> HBO <le> exposure. A radiochemical assay was used to assess NOS activity in rat aortic endothelial cells. Catalytic activity of eNOS in cell homogenates was not decreased by <el> HBO <le>, and in vivo <el> HBO <le> exposure to 2.8 ATA was without effect on eNOS activity and/or vascular NO bioavailability in vitro. 
Muscle development, or myogenesis, is a highly regulated, complex process. A subset of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as critical regulators of myogenesis. Recently, miR-378a was found to be involved in myogenesis, but the mechanism of how miR-378a regulates the proliferation and <re> differentiation <er> of myoblasts has not been determined. We found that <el> miR-378a-3p <le> expression in muscle was significantly higher than in other tissues, suggesting an important effect on muscle development. Overexpression of <el> miR-378a-3p <le> increased the expression of MyoD and MHC in C2C12 myoblasts both at the level of mRNA and protein, confirming that <el> miR-378a-3p <le> promoted muscle cell <re> differentiation <er>. The forced expression of <el> miR-378a-3p <le> promoted apoptosis of C2C12 cells as evidenced by CCK-8 assay and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining results. Through TargetScan, histone acetylation enzyme 4 (HDAC4) was identified as a potential target of <el> miR-378a-3p <le>. We confirmed targeting of HDAC4 by <el> miR-378a-3p <le> using a dual luciferase assay and western blotting. Our RNAi analysis results also showed that HDAC4 significantly promoted <re> differentiation <er> of C2C12 cells and inhibited cell survival through Bcl-2. 
It is presently unclear whether men with a history of constitutional delay (<el> CD <le>) of puberty are osteopenic. This study compares auxology, bone <re> mass <er>, size, and density of 32 men (age, 21-33 yr) with previous <el> CD <le> with 45 controls. Using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, areal bone mineral density (aBMD) and volumetric bone mineral density at the lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN), hip strength analysis, and total-body and body segment (arms, legs, trunk) measurements were determined. Auxological variables, body composition, the muscle-bone relation, and the effect of prior androgen treatment were studied. Men with previous <el> CD <le> were shorter (P < 0.001) and had shorter height-adjusted arms compared with controls. Height-adjusted total-body bone mineral content (BMC) (P = 0.004), aBMD (P = 0.016), and bone area (P = 0.006) but not lean tissue <re> mass <er> (P = 0.507) were lower in <el> CD <le> men compared with controls; consequently, their BMC to lean tissue <re> mass <er> ratio was reduced (P < 0.001). Segment length-adjusted BMC and bone area of arms (P < 0.001) and legs (P < 0.03), but not trunk were lower in <el> CD <le> men than in controls. They had lower LS aBMD (P = 0.044) but normal LS and FN volumetric bone mineral density. Size-adjusted LS width and the hip cross-sectional area were lower than in controls. 
2-chloroadenosine (2-CAdo) is an adenosine deaminase-resistant analogue of adenosine, widely used as an adenosine receptor agonist. This compound has been shown to induce <re> apoptosis <er> in several cell types either via activation of adenosine receptors or via intracellular metabolism. However, the molecular mechanisms of 2-CAdo-induced <re> apoptosis <er> are unclear. Here, we analyzed the effects of 2-CAdo in the leukemia cell line EHEB. 2-CAdo was found to induce <re> apoptosis <er> in EHEB cells, as shown by caspase-3 activation, DNA fragmentation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and phosphatidylserine exposure. Cytotoxicity of 2-CAdo was completely suppressed by 5-iodotubercidin, an adenosine kinase inhibitor, indicating that <re> apoptosis <er> induced by 2-CAdo was the result of its intracellular metabolism. Accordingly, we found that 2-CAdo was efficiently converted into 2-chloroATP. In parallel, a decrease of intracellular <el> ATP <le> concentration as well as a general inhibition of macromolecular synthesis, involving DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, was observed. Moreover, 2-CAdo induced cytochrome c release into the cytosol, indicating activation of the intrinsic pathway of <re> apoptosis <er>. This was found associated with a decline in Mcl-1 protein level and p53-independent. Inhibition of AMP deaminase by coformycin markedly prevented <el> ATP <le> depletion, and also significantly reduced 2-CAdo cytotoxicity and caspase-3 activation. 
Previous reports have suggested that infusions of <el> lidocaine <le> (lignocaine) cause a high incidence of <re> phlebitis <er>. We investigated the possibility of reducing this high incidence by the addition of small amounts of heparin or hydrocortisone (or both) to the infusate of <el> lidocaine <le>. One hundred patients with acute myocardial infarction who were to receive a 48-hour prophylactic infusion of <el> lidocaine <le> (2.25 mg/min) were randomized to have one of the following added to their infusate in double-blind fashion: (1) placebo; (2) heparin (4,000 units/24 hr); (3) hydrocortisone (20 mg/24 hr); or (4) heparin and hydrocortisone. After 48 hours the incidence of <re> phlebitis <er> was 94 percent in the control group but only 41 percent in the group receiving heparin and hydrocortisone (p less than 0.005). Had the infusion been stopped after 24 hours, the incidence of <re> phlebitis <er> would have been 56 percent in the group receiving placebo, but only 19 percent in the drug-treated groups (p less than 0.01). 
The Goto Kakizaki (GK) rat is a widely used animal model to study defective <el> glucose <le>-stimulated insulin release in type-2 diabetes (T2D). As in T2D patients, the expression of several proteins involved in Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis of insulin-containing large dense-core vesicles is dysregulated in this model. So far, a defect in late steps of <re> insulin secretion <er> could not be demonstrated. To resolve this apparent contradiction, we studied Ca(2+)-secretion coupling of healthy and GK rat beta cells in acute pancreatic tissue slices by assessing exocytosis with high time-resolution membrane capacitance measurements. We found that beta cells of GK rats respond to <el> glucose <le> stimulation with a normal increase in the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration. During trains of depolarizing pulses, the secretory activity from GK rat beta cells was defective in spite of upregulated cell size and doubled voltage-activated Ca(2+) currents. In GK rat beta cells, evoked Ca(2+) entry was significantly less efficient in triggering release than in nondiabetic controls. This impairment was neither due to a decrease of functional vesicle pool sizes nor due to different kinetics of pool refilling. Strong stimulation with two successive trains of depolarizing pulses led to a prominent activity-dependent facilitation of release in GK rat beta cells, whereas secretion in controls was unaffected. Broad-spectrum inhibition of PKC sensitized Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis, whereas it prevented the activity-dependent facilitation in GK rat beta cells. 
Expression of muscle-specific glycogen synthase (<re> GS <er>) and phosphofructokinase (PFK) was analyzed in seven athletes and eight control subjects who were characterized using the euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic (2 mU.kg-1.min-1) clamp technique in combination with indirect calorimetry and biopsy sampling of vastus lateralis muscle. In the basal state, total <re> GS <er> activity and half-maximal <re> GS <er> activation by glucose 6-phosphate (G-6-P) were respectively 34% (P < 0.03) and 50% (P < 0.005) higher in athletes than in control subjects. In parallel, <re> GS <er> mRNA/microgram total RNA in athletes was 40% (P < 0.005) higher. No difference in <re> GS <er> immunoreactive protein abundance was found between the groups. PFK activity and protein levels were respectively 15% (P < 0.05) and 20% (P < 0.02) lower in athletes, whereas no differences was found in the level of PFK mRNA. After 4 h of hyperinsulinemia, total glucose disposal rate (P < 0.005) and both nonoxidative (P < 0.02) and oxidative (P < 0.03) glucose metabolism were significantly higher in athletes. In parallel, after hyperinsulinemia, the relative activation of <re> GS <er> by G-6-P was significantly higher in athletes, whereas total activity and gene expression of both <re> GS <er> and PFK were unaffected by <el> insulin <le>. 
<re> MUC1 <er> is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on the apical surface of airway epithelial cells and plays an anti-inflammatory role during airway bacterial infection. In this study, we determined whether the anti-inflammatory effect of <re> MUC1 <er> is also operative during the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. The lung epithelial cell line A549 was treated with RSV, and the production of <el> TNFalpha <le> and the levels of <re> MUC1 <er> protein were monitored temporally during the course of infection by ELISA and Western blot analysis. Small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) transfection was utilized to assess the role of <re> MUC1 <er> in regulating RSV-mediated inflammatory responses by lung epithelial cells. Our results revealed that: 1) following RSV infection, an increase in <re> MUC1 <er> level was preceded by an increase in <el> TNFalpha <le> production and completely inhibited by soluble TNF receptor (TNFR); and 2) knockdown of <re> MUC1 <er> using <re> MUC1 <er> siRNA resulted in a greater increase in <el> TNFalpha <le> level following RSV infection compared with control siRNA treatment. 
High glucose (<el> HG <le>)-induced oxidative stress contributes to the dysfunction of pancreatic β cells in diabetes. The voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 has been proposed to support reactive oxygen species (ROS) production during respiratory bursts. However, the effect of Hv1 on glucotoxicity in pancreatic β cells is not clear yet. In this study, we examined the protective effects of Hv1-deficiency in <el> HG <le> cultured β cells. Following 48 h of treatment with 30 mM high glucose, Hv1 KO β cells showed higher cell viability, lower cell apoptosis and a more stable insulin gene expression level compared to WT β cells. In both control and <el> HG <le> cultured β cells, deficiency of Hv1 decreased the glucose- and PMA-induced ROS production. Finally, <el> HG <le> incubation led to <re> NOX4 <er> upregulation in WT β cells, which could be inhibited by HV1 deficiency. 
Interleukin (IL)-6 plays important roles in autoimmunity and inflammation and is essential for T helper (Th) 2 and <el> Th17 <le> differentiation. However, whether it is involved in the development and function of dendritic cells (DCs) during allergen-induced airway inflammation and airway hyper-reactivity (AHR) remains undefined. In this study, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p)-induced airway inflammation and AHR were studied in IL-6 knockout (KO) mice. Der p-loaded bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) from IL-6 KO mice were used to assaying their ability to induce airway inflammation in naïve wild-type mice. Our results showed that IL-6 KO mice showed reduced AHR, significant decreases in inflammatory cell recruitment and Th2 and <el> Th17 <le> cytokine production in the airways, and lowered Der p-specific immunoglobulin G1 after Der p exposure. Further exploration of BMDCs from IL-6 KO mice revealed decreased activity of phagocytosis and reduced expression of MHC class II and CD86 after Der p stimulation. Adoptive transfer of Der p-loaded BMDCs from IL-6 KO mice also showed a functional defect in their inability to induce Th2 and <el> Th17 <le> immune responses and trigger airway inflammation and AHR in recipient mice. Finally, in allergic <re> asthma <er>tics, DCs that differentiated from monocytes treated with anti-IL-6 receptor antibody (tocilizumab) had poor capacity for eliciting Th2 polarization as compared to DCs generated from monocytes without antibody treatment. 
gamma-Aminobutyric acid (<el> GABA <le>), a major neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, also acts as a paracrine or autocrine signaling molecule in endocrine tissues such as the pancreatic islets, adenohypophysis, and testis. In the present study, we describe local <el> GABA <le> production and functional <el> GABA <le>(B) receptors in the adrenal cortex, possibly forming an auto- or paracrine <el> GABA <le>ergic system. Using immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR, we localized the <el> GABA <le>-synthesizing enzyme glutamate decarboxylase 67 and the vesicular <el> GABA <le> transporter in <re> steroid <er>-producing cells of the human and rat adrenal cortex. Immunocytochemistry, Western blots, and RT-PCR experiments demonstrated the presence of glutamate decarboxylase 67 in the human adrenocortical cell line NCI-H295R. Measurements of glutamate decarboxylase activity confirmed that, in these cells and in rat adrenals, glutamate is decarboxylated to form <el> GABA <le>. In addition, we found expression of the <el> GABA <le>(B(1a)), <el> GABA <le>(B(1e)), and <el> GABA <le>(B(2)) subunits of the heterodimeric <el> GABA <le>(B) receptor in NCI-H295R cells as shown by RT-PCR. <el> GABA <le>(B(1a)) and its truncated splice variant <el> GABA <le>(B(1e)) were also found in human and rat adrenal glands. Immunostaining for the <el> GABA <le>(B(2)) subunit revealed its presence in the human and rat adrenal cortex and in NCI-H295R cells. The <el> GABA <le>(B) receptors we identified were functional because the <el> GABA <le>(B) agonist baclofen inhibited T-type Ca(2+) currents in whole-cell patch clamp experiments on NCI-H295R cells. This effect was blocked by pertussis toxin. Furthermore, the alpha(2)-, alpha(3)-, beta(2)-, beta(3)- gamma(2)-, and epsilon-subunits of the <el> GABA <le>(A) receptor were detected in this cell line by RT-PCR. 
Postoperative <re> pain <er> is a major problem following surgery in the ambulatory child. A study was undertaken to test the effect of intraoperative <el> bupivacaine <le> on postoperative <re> pain <er> in children undergoing outpatient hernia repair. Ninety-nine children aged 1 to 7 years underwent outpatient inguinal herniorrhaphy under general anesthesia. Each was randomly assigned to receive <el> bupivacaine <le> (group 1) or saline (group 2), infiltrating the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves. Drug administration and patient evaluation were double-blinded. The groups were similar with respect to age, sex, side of procedure, and length of operation. In the immediate postoperative period, 17 group 1 patients required analgesics compared with 39 in group 2 (P less than .01); total codeine dosage was lower in group 1 (4.0 +/- 7.1 mg v 11.8 +/- 10.5 mg, P less than .05). Activity level 45 minutes after surgery (using a standardized scale) was greater in group 1 (P less than .05). Acetaminophen requirements at home were lower in group 1 on the day of surgery (3.1 +/- 4.3 mL v 5.7 +/- 7.4 mL, P less than .05) and over the following 48 hours (1.5 +/- 3.4 mL v 4.9 +/- 10.7 mL, P less than .05). Activity level at home on the day of surgery did not differ significantly between groups, but activity level over the following 48 hours was higher in group 1 (P less than .05). The two groups were similar with respect to all other parameters. 
We attempted to confirm that seed <re> bank <er>s can be viewed as an important genetic reservoir by testing the hypothesis that standing (aboveground) plants represent a nonrandom sample of the seed <re> bank <er>. We sampled multilocus allozyme genotypes from three species with different life history strategies: Amaranthus retroflexus, Carduus acanthoides, Pastinaca sativa. In four populations of each species we analysed the extent to which allele and genotype frequencies vary in consecutive life history stages including the summer seed <re> bank <er>, which has been overlooked up to now. We compared the winter seed <re> bank <er> (i.e., seeds collected before the <el> spring <le> germination peak), seedlings, rosettes, the summer seed <re> bank <er> (i.e., seeds collected after the <el> spring <le> germination peak) and fruiting plants. We found that: (1) All three species partitioned most of their genetic diversity within life history stages and less among stages within populations and among populations. (2) All genetic diversity parameters, except for allele frequencies, were similar among all life history stages across all populations in different species. (3) There were differences in allele frequencies among life history stages at all localities in Amaranthus retroflexus and at three localities in both Carduus acanthoides and Pastinaca sativa. (4) Allele frequencies did not differ between the winter and summer seed <re> bank <er> in most Carduus acanthoides and Pastinaca sativa populations, but there was a marked difference in Amaranthus retroflexus. 
Obesity and high saturated fat intake increase the risk of heart failure and arrhythmias. The molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We hypothesized that physiologic levels of saturated fat could increase mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (<re> ROS <er>) in cardiomyocytes, leading to abnormalities of calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function. We investigated the effect of saturated fat on mitochondrial function and calcium homeostasis in isolated ventricular myocytes. The saturated fatty acid <el> palmitate <le> causes a decrease in mitochondrial respiration in cardiomyocytes. Palmitate, but not the monounsaturated fatty acid oleate, causes an increase in both total cellular <re> ROS <er> and mitochondrial <re> ROS <er>. Palmitate depolarizes the mitochondrial inner membrane and causes mitochondrial calcium overload by increasing sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium leak. Inhibitors of PKC or NOX2 prevent mitochondrial dysfunction and the increase in <re> ROS <er>, demonstrating that PKC-NOX2 activation is also required for amplification of <el> palmitate <le> induced-<re> ROS <er>. Cardiomyocytes from mice with genetic deletion of NOX2 do not have <el> palmitate <le>-induced <re> ROS <er> or mitochondrial dysfunction. 
The use of <el> clopidogrel <le> (Plavix), an inhibitor of adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation, has been proven to reduce ischemic events in cardiovascular patients, but little information is available for optimal monitoring of platelet function in patients receiving the drug preoperatively. In the first part of the study we compared different testing modalities (thrombelastography (TEG), platelet aggregometry, and whole blood aggregation) to assess platelet <re> ADP receptor <er> inhibition. Because <el> clopidogrel <le> is a pro-drug, we used an in vitro model of ADP inhibition with 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (FSBA). FSBA at final concentration of 80 microM completely inhibited platelet aggregation but had no effect on TEG maximum amplitude (MA). In the second part of the study, antiplatelet effects of <el> clopidogrel <le> were clinically assessed and correlated to postoperative bleeding in 18 coronary bypass surgery patients. Preoperative TEG results were normal or hypercoagulable in <el> clopidogrel <le>-treated patients, although platelet aggregation responses to ADP were inhibited. Clopidogrel-treated patients who underwent cardiopulmonary bypass had a high incidence (84.6%) of platelet transfusion therapy due to increased chest tube drainage. 
The time- and dose-dependent transcriptional and translational expression of biomarker genes in nonylphenol (<el> NP <le>) and estradiol-17beta (E(2)) treated juvenile rainbow trout is reported. Fish were exposed to <el> NP <le> (1, 5 and 25 mg/kg) and E(2) (5 mg/kg) and killed at 2, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h after exposure. The estrogen receptor (ER), vitellogenin (Vtg) and eggshell zona radiata protein (Zr-protein) gene expressions were analyzed in total liver RNA using Northern and slot hybridization with specific cDNA probes. Plasma Vtg and Zr-protein levels were evaluated using indirect ELISA. While Zr-protein gene showed an induction only at 24 h post-exposure, the plasma protein levels showed a time-dependent increase in the 25-mg <el> NP <le> treated group. Vtg transcripts showed an apparent time-dependent increase without a concomitant increase in protein levels in the 25-mg <el> NP <le> treated fish. Time-dependent increases in Vtg and <re> Zr-protein gene expressions <er> without the corresponding increases in ER gene transcription was observed in E(2)-treated fish at 2, 6 and 12 h post-exposure. Induction of ER gene transcripts was observed from 24 h and did not change significantly at 48 and 72 h. In the E(2)-treated fish, induction of plasma Vtg levels was observed at 48 and 72 h, while plasma Zr-protein was induced at 24, 48 and 72 h, after exposure. 
The ability of the multidrug resistance modifiers R- and R,S-verapamil (VPL), cyclosporine A (<el> CsA <le>) and its non-immunosuppressive derivative SDZ <re> PSC 833 <er> (<re> PSC 833 <er>) to inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated transepithelial flux of tritiated vinblastine was investigated using tight and highly resistant (R > 1,400 omega cm2) monolayer cultures of intestinal adenocarcinoma-derived HCT-8 cells grown on permeable tissue-culture inserts. Apical addition of these chemosensitizers inhibited drug flux (137 pmol h-1 cm-2; range, 133-142 pmol h-1 cm-2) in the basal to apical secretory direction at clinically relevant concentrations, with <re> PSC 833 <er> showing the highest activity, exhibiting inhibition at concentrations as low as 10 ng/ml (9 nM). Acidification of the modulator-containing apical compartment to an extracellular pH (pHo) of 6.8 had no influence on MDR reversal by <el> CsA <le> at 1 microgram/ml (0.9 microM; flux inhibition, 52%) or by <re> PSC 833 <er> at 100 ng/ml (0.09 microM; flux inhibition, 60%), in contrast to R,S- and R-VPL, which showed decreased inhibition and caused less accumulation of vinblastine in HCT-8 cells under this condition (flux inhibition of 35% and 23%, respectively, at pHo 6.8 vs 50% and 43%, respectively, at pHo 7.5). P-gp-mediated rhodamine 123 efflux from dye-loaded single-cell suspensions of HCT-8 cells as measured by flow cytometry was not impeded at pHo 6.8 in comparison with pHo 7.5 in standard medium, but at low pHo the inhibitory activity of R-VPL (29% vs 60% rhodamine 123 efflux inhibition) was diminished significantly, again without a reduction in the effect of <re> PSC 833 <er> (rhodamine 123 flux inhibition, 75%). 
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and FGF23 are the primary hormones regulating acute phosphate homeostasis. Human renal proximal tubule cells (RPTECs) were used to characterize the mechanism and signaling pathways of PTH and FGF23 on <re> phosphate transport <er> and the role of the PDZ protein NHERF1 in mediating PTH and FGF23 effects. RPTECs express the NPT2A <re> phosphate transport <er>er, αKlotho, FGFR1, FGFR3, FGFR4, and the PTH receptor. FGFR1 isoforms are formed from alternate splicing of exon 3 and of exon 8 or 9 in Ir-like loop 3. Exon 3 was absent, but mRNA containing both exons 8 and 9 is present in cytoplasm. Using an <el> FGFR1c <le>-specific antibody together with mass spectrometry analysis, we show that RPTECs express FGFR-β1C. The data are consistent with regulated FGFR1 splicing involving a novel cytoplasmic mechanism. PTH and FGF23 inhibited <re> phosphate transport <er> in a concentration-dependent manner. At maximally effective concentrations, PTH and FGF23 equivalently decreased phosphate uptake and were not additive, suggesting a shared mechanism of action. Protein kinase A or C blockade prevented PTH but not FGF23 actions. Conversely, inhibiting SGK1, blocking FGFR dimerization, or knocking down Klotho expression disrupted FGF23 actions but did not interfere with PTH effects. C-terminal FGF23(180-251) competitively and selectively blocked FGF23 action without disrupting PTH effects. However, both PTH and FGF23-sensitive <re> phosphate transport <er> were abolished by NHERF1 shRNA knockdown. Extended treatment with PTH or FGF23 down-regulated NPT2A without affecting NHERF1. 
The aim of our work was to study non-<el> insulin <le>-mediated <re> glucose uptake <er> (NIMGU), in the postabsorptive state, in several pathologies characterized by peripheral <el> insulin <le> resistance, namely, obesity (n = 10), NIDDM (n = 7), acromegaly (n = 7) and Cushing's disease (n = 6). These groups were compared with a group of 16 healthy subjects. To estimate peripheral <el> insulin <le> sensitivity (SI) and glucose effectiveness (SG), we used the minimal model of glucose metabolism. Although all of these pathologies showed severe <el> insulin <le> resistance (control: 6.44 +/- 2.63, obesity: 2.84 +/- 1.57, NIDDM: 1.71 +/- 0.77, acromegaly: 1.88 +/- 1.23, Cushing's disease: 1.87 +/- 0.66 x 10(-4) min-1 (microU/ml)-1, P < 0.01), fasting <el> insulin <le>-mediated <re> glucose uptake <er> (IMGU) did not differ significantly among the five groups, because reactive hyperinsulinaemia was present in all of these states. The contribution of NIMGU to whole-body <re> glucose uptake <er> did not differ significantly among the five groups (control: 77 +/- 8%; obesity: 77 +/- 9%; acromegaly: 82 +/- 8%; Cushing's disease: 83 +/- 8%; NIDDM: 84 +/- 7%). 
Our previous report stated that kikyo-to, a Japanese herbal medicine, consisting of the roots of Platycodon grandiflorum and Glycyrrhiza sp., stimulates the pancreatic exocrine secretion of conscious rats. The present study focused on the effective components of kikyo-to and the mechanism of stimuli to pancreatic secretion of rats. When 10 to 100 mg of <el> platycodin D <le>, a saponin from the root of Platycodon grandiflorum, was intragastrically administered, the pancreatic secretion of rats was stimulated. At the same time, the plasma <re> CCK <er> concentration increased. On the other hand, the stimulative effects of glycyrrhizin, a saponin from the root of Glycyrrhiza sp. were weak compared to <el> platycodin D <le>. The effects of 10 mg/kg of <el> platycodin D <le> on pancreatic secretion were inhibited by loxiglumide (50 mg/kg, i.g.), a <re> CCK <er> receptor antagonist. In contrast, the suppressive effect of atropine (300 micrograms/kg/h, i.v.) on pancreatic secretion was reduced by administering 10 mg/kg of <el> platycodin D <le>. In addition, up to 1 mM of <el> platycodin D <le> did not inhibit the trypsin activities in vitro. 
Valproic acid (<el> VPA <le>) is a widely used and well-tolerable antiepileptic drug in epileptic patients. However, <el> VPA <le> has many side effects dose-dependent or non-dose-dependent. It is reported that <el> VPA <le> treatment may lead to <re> biotin <er> deficiency and low serum and liver tissue <re> biotin <er>idase enzyme activity (BEA). Major clinical manifestations in <re> biotin <er> deficiency are seborrheic dermatitis, dry skin, fine and brittle hair, and alopecia. We aimed to investigate the effects of <re> biotin <er> supplementation on serum and liver tissue BEA and alopecia during <el> VPA <le> therapy. Rats were randomly divided into 4 groups, each consisted of 15 rats (<el> VPA <le>-B1, <el> VPA <le>-B2, <el> VPA <le>, and control). Except the control group, all groups were administrated <el> VPA <le> dose of 600 mg/kg/d per oral (PO) for 60 days with 12h intervals two divided doses. <el> VPA <le>-B1 was administrated <re> biotin <er> dose of 6 mg/kg/d and <el> VPA <le>-B2 was administrated <re> biotin <er> dose of 0.6 mg/kg/d. In the third week of the study, we determined alopecia in the study groups. Alopecia was seen in the subjects of 13.3% of <el> VPA <le>-B1 (n=2), 13.3% of <el> VPA <le>-B2 (n=2), and 40% of <el> VPA <le> (n=6). But statistical significant effect on alopecia by <re> biotin <er> supplementation was not able to be determined between the study groups. In the control group, alopecia was not observed. The ratios of alopecia in the study groups were statistically higher than the control group (p=0.028). Itchiness was more obvious in the study groups compared with the control group. Serum <re> biotin <er> levels of the <re> biotin <er> supplemented groups (<el> VPA <le>-B1 and <el> VPA <le>-B2) were higher than the other groups (<el> VPA <le> and control group). Serum <re> biotin <er> levels of the <el> VPA <le> group were lower than the control group. There were significant decreases in the levels of serum and liver tissue BEA of the study groups compared with the control group. 
Inflammation and <re> proliferation <er> of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are the key events in intimal hyperplasia. This study aimed to explore the mechanism by which long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) <el> KCNQ1OT1 <le> affects VSMC inflammation and <re> proliferation <er> in this context. A vein graft (VG) model was established in mice to introduce intimal hyperplasia. Isolated normal VSMCs were induced with platelet-derived growth factor type BB (PDGF-BB), and the cell <re> proliferation <er>, migration, and secretion of inflammatory factors were determined. The results showed that <el> KCNQ1OT1 <le> was downregulated in the VSMCs from mice with intimal hyperplasia and in the PDGF-BB-treated VSMCs, and such downregulation of <el> KCNQ1OT1 <le> resulted from the increased methylation level in the <el> KCNQ1OT1 <le> promoter. Overexpressing <el> KCNQ1OT1 <le> suppressed PDFG-BB-induced VSMC <re> proliferation <er>, migration, and secretion of inflammatory factors. In VSMCs, <el> KCNQ1OT1 <le> bound to the nuclear transcription factor kappa Ba (IκBa) protein and increased the cellular IκBa level by reducing phosphorylation and promoting ubiquitination of the IκBa protein. Meanwhile, <el> KCNQ1OT1 <le> promoted the expression of IκBa by sponging miR-221. The effects of <el> KCNQ1OT1 <le> knockdown on promoting VSMC <re> proliferation <er>, migration, and secretion of inflammatory factors were abolished by IκBa overexpression. The roles of <el> KCNQ1OT1 <le> in reducing the intimal area and inhibiting IκBa expression were proved in the VG mouse model after <el> KCNQ1OT1 <le> overexpression. 
1. Multiple effects of the imidazole compound <el> SK <le>&F 96365 have been evaluated on endothelial cells from human umbilical vein using a combined patch clamp and Ca(2+)-microfluorimetric technique (Fura-2). 2. At concentrations of 100 mumol/l or higher of <el> SK <le>&F 96365, the block of the receptor-mediated Ca2+ entry overlaps with the activation of another Ca(2+)-entry mechanism, which is associated with a non selective cationic current. 3. This rise in [Ca2+]i depends on the extracellular Ca(2+)-concentration, and the entry pathway is in contrast with the receptor-mediated Ca(2+)-entry pathway permeable to Ni2+, as shown by quenching of the Fura-2 fluorescence signal. 4. The concentration of <el> SK <le>&F 96365 for half maximal increase in [Ca2+]i was 141 +/- 19 mumol/l (n = 16). 5. <el> SK <le>&F 96365 activated a current that reversed at +11.8 +/- 2.1 mV (n = 21) when measured using nystatin-perforated patches with either Cs+ or <re> K+ <er> in the pipette and 140 Na+, 1.5 Ca2+ in the bath (chloride equilibrium potential ECl = -36 mV). 6. <el> SK <le>&F 96365 (200 mumol/l) blocked an inwardly rectifying <re> K+ <er> current in endothelial cells independently of [Ca2+]i. This block caused depolarization of the endothelial cells from -55.3 +/- 2.57 mV (n = 33) to -10 +/- 5.5 mV (n = 6). This block was concentration-dependent, half maximal block occurred at a concentration of about 40 mumol/l <el> SK <le>&F 96365. 7. In cells which showed an outwardly rectifying current, this outward component was also completely blocked by 200 mumol/l <el> SK <le>&F 96365. 8. 
Equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) mutants devoid of the open reading frames (ORFs) of either glycoprotein (g) B or M were constructed and tested for their immunogenic potential in a murine model of EHV-1 infection. The mutant viruses were engineered using the virulent EHV-1 strain RacL11 or the modified live vaccine strain RacH by inserting the Escherichia coli LacZ gene into the viral ORFs. RacL11-infected mice showed signs typical of an EHV-1 infection, whereas mice infected with the EHV-1 <el> gB <le>- or <re> gM <er>-negative mutants or with RacH did not develop disease. No difference in the pathogenic potential of RacL11 <el> gB <le>- and <re> gM <er>-negative viruses was observed after application of either phenotypically completed or negative viruses. However, revertant RacL11 viruses in which the <el> gB <le> or <re> gM <er> gene had been restored caused EHV-1-related symptoms that were indistinguishable from those induced by RacL11. Mice that had been immunized with phenotypically negative <el> gB <le>- and <re> gM <er>-deficient EHV-1 were challenged with the RacL11 virus 25 days after immunization. Mock-immunized mice developed EHV-1 disease and high virus loads in their lungs were observed. In contrast, mice developed not exhibit EHV-1-caused disease. 
The existence of memory B cells for <re> IgE <er> was investigated using spleen cells harvested from <el> mice <le> primed and boosted with dinitrophenylated keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Using the polymerase chain reaction, it was found that mRNA for <re> IgE <er> was already demonstrable in spleen cells taken 1 day after boost. Spleen cells taken from <el> mice <le> 1 day after boost and cultured in vitro without the addition of antigen also produced anti-dinitrophenylated (DNP) <re> IgE <er> antibody. In contrast, mRNA for <re> IgE <er> in spleen cells from <el> mice <le> primed 4 weeks previously, but not boosted, was not demonstrable. Anti-DNP <re> IgE <er> was not produced in cultures of spleen cells from <el> mice <le> primed but not boosted. 
The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of increased <el> cAMP <le> levels in response to pituitary <re> adenylate <er> cyclase-activating polypeptide 27 (PACAP27) on atrial atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) secretion in rabbit atria. A perfused beating atrial model was used in the present study and <el> cAMP <le> efflux and ANP levels in atrial perfusates were measured by radioimmnoassay. At 100 nmol/L, PACAP27 increased <el> cAMP <le> production, which resulted in subsequent inhibition of ANP secretion. Nicardipine (1.0 micromol/L), an L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, attenuated inhibition of ANP secretion by PACAP27. Staurosporine (1.0 micromol/L), a non-specific protein kinase inhibitor, and H-89 (1.0 micromol/L), a <el> cAMP <le>-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, completely blocked the inhibition of ANP secretion in response to PACAP27 but had no effect on PACAP27-induced increases in <el> cAMP <le>. 
1. Secretin has been recognized as an important enterogastrone. In order to investigate the mechanism of secretin-induced inhibition of <re> gastric acid secretion <er>, the effects of both anti-<el> somatostatin <le> antibody and indomethacin on acid secretion were examined in conscious rats with gastric cannulas. 2. Secretin given intravenously at 5.6 pmol kg-1 h-1 inhibited profoundly the acid secretion stimulated by pentagastrin at 0.3 microgram kg-1 h-1. 3. When a rabbit antisomatostatin serum was given intravenously, it not only abolished the secretin-induced inhibition on the pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion, but also augmented both basal and pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion. 4. Indomethacin also significantly augmented basal acid secretion, starting 45 min after the drug delivery began. It reversed the secretin-induced inhibition but it did not augment the pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion. 5. Neither antisomatostatin serum influenced prostaglandin E2-induced inhibition of the pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion, nor did indomethacin affect the inhibition by <el> somatostatin <le>, suggesting strongly that the inhibition by <el> somatostatin <le> is not mediated by endogenous prostaglandins, nor is that by prostaglandins E2 mediated by endogenous <el> somatostatin <le>. 6. 
Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) induces 2 closely associated immune responses: graft-versus-<el> tumor <le> (<re> GVT <er>) activity and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We have previously shown that pretransplant immunization of allogeneic BMT donors with a recipient-derived <el> tumor <le> cell vaccine increases both <re> GVT <er> activity and lethal GVHD because of the priming of donor T cells against putative minor histocompatibility antigens (mHAgs) on the <el> tumor <le> vaccine cells. The work reported here tested the hypothesis that <el> tumor <le> cell vaccination after BMT would produce an increase in <re> GVT <er> activity without exacerbating GVHD. C3H.SW donor bone marrow and splenocytes were transplanted into major histocompatibility complex-matched, mHAg-mismatched C57BL/6 recipients. One month after BMT, recipients were immunized against either a C57BL/6 myeloid leukemia (C1498) or fibrosarcoma (205). Immunized recipients had a significant increase in survival and protection against <el> tumor <le> growth in both <el> tumor <le> models, and significant <el> tumor <le> protection was seen even in recipients with preexisting micrometastatic cancer before immunization. Alloreactivity appeared to contribute to the in vitro anti-<el> tumor <le> cytolytic activity, but in vivo immunity was <el> tumor <le> specific, and no exacerbation of GVHD was observed. Although the immunodominant mHAg B6(dom1) was shown to be expressed by all B6 <el> tumor <le>s tested and was largely responsible for the alloreactivity resulting from <el> tumor <le> immunization of donors, the in vitro alloreactivity of immune recipients was more restricted and was not mediated by recognition of B6(dom1). 
Ovarian cancer has one of the highest mortalities in malignancies in women, but little is known of its tumour progression properties and there is still no effective molecule that can monitor its growth or therapeutic responses. MSLN (mesothelin), a secreted protein that is overexpressed in ovarian cancer tissues with a poor clinical outcome, has been previously identified to activate PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/Akt signalling and inhibit paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. The present study investigates the correlation between MSLN and MMP (matrix metalloproteinase)-7 in the progression of ovarian cancer, and the mechanism of MSLN in enhancing ovarian cancer <re> invasion <er>. The expression of MSLN correlated well with <el> MMP-7 <le> expression in human ovarian cancer tissues. Overexpressing MSLN or ovarian cancer cells treated with MSLN showed enhanced migration and <re> invasion <er> of cancer cells through the induction of <el> MMP-7 <le>. MSLN regulated the expression of <el> MMP-7 <le> through the ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) 1/2, Akt and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) pathways. The expression of <el> MMP-7 <le> and the migrating ability of MSLN-treated ovarian cancer cells were suppressed by ERK1/2- or JNK-specific inhibitors, or a decoy AP-1 (activator protein 1) oligonucleotide in in vitro experiments, whereas in vivo animal experiments also demonstrated that mice treated with MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)/ERK- or JNK-specific inhibitors could decrease intratumour <el> MMP-7 <le> expression, delay tumour growth and extend the survival of the mice. 
Isolated, intact spinach chloroplasts incubated in light in the presence of HCO 3 (-) and <el> NO <le> 2 (-) have the greater proportion of their <re> NADP <er> present in the reduced form. The steady state concentration of <re> NADP <er>H in light in these chloroplasts is significantly higher in the presence of <el> NO <le>2 than in its absence. 
This study was undertaken to determine the short-loop negative feedback at the hypothalamic site after adrenalectomy (ADX), when the hypothalamic-pituitary axis was a different set-points. Rats were submitted to the experimental procedure 3 h and 1, 3 and 14 days after bilateral ADX or sham surgery under ether anesthesia by the dorsal approach. ADX rats were supplied with 1.5% NaCl. After decapitation, plasma samples were collected and corticosterone (B) and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (<el> ACTH <le>) concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Using in vitro incubation of the median basal hypothalamus (MBH) fragment we studied the hypothalamic corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) release under basal conditions and under the inhibitory effect of <el> ACTH <le>. Hypothalamic <re> CRH secretion <er>, determined by direct RIA, without extraction and reported as pg CRH/MBH per 1 h incubation, was inhibited by <el> ACTH <le> administration in a dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by a significant negative correlation obtained by linear regression analysis of <re> CRH secretion <er> as a function of <el> ACTH <le> dose. However, the percentage of inhibition of <re> CRH secretion <er> was higher at 1 and 3 days than at 14 days after ADX. 
Mildly oxidized low-density lipoprotein activates platelets through lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Hence, the platelet-activating properties attributed to native low-density lipoprotein (nLDL) might be caused by LPA contamination. We show that nLDL enhances thrombin receptor-activating peptide (<el> TRAP <le>)-induced <re> fibrinogen <er> binding to alpha(IIb)beta(3). The LPA receptor blocker N-palmitoyl-L-serine-phosphoric acid did not affect nLDL-enhanced <re> fibrinogen <er> binding induced by <el> TRAP <le>, but reduced <el> TRAP <le>-induced binding. cAMP and inhibitors of protein kinase C and Ca(2+) rises completely blocked ligand binding by <el> TRAP <le> and nLDL/<el> TRAP <le>. Inhibitors of p38(MAPK) and ADP secretion interfered only partially. Blockade of Rho-kinase increased ligand binding 2-3-fold. 
In this study we have examined the effects of <el> insulin <le> on <re> protein synthesis <er> in cultured fetal chick neurons. Protein synthesis was monitored by measuring the incorporation of [3H]leucine (3H-leu) into trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-precipitable protein. Upon addition of 3H-leu, there was a 5-min lag before radioactivity occurred in protein. During this period cell-associated radioactivity reached equilibrium and was totally recovered in the TCA-soluble fraction. After 5 min, the incorporation of 3H-leu into protein was linear for 2 h and was inhibited (98%) by the inclusion of 10 micrograms/ml cycloheximide. After 24 h of serum deprivation, <el> insulin <le> increased 3H-leu incorporation into protein by approximately 2-fold. The stimulation of <re> protein synthesis <er> by <el> insulin <le> was dose dependent (ED50 = 70 pM) and seen within 30 min. Proinsulin was approximately 10-fold less potent than <el> insulin <le> on a molar basis in stimulating neuronal <re> protein synthesis <er>. Insulin had no effect on the TCA-soluble fraction of 3H-leu at any time and did not influence the uptake of [3H]aminoisobutyric acid into neurons. The isotope ratio of 3H-leu/14C-leu in the leucyl tRNA pool was the same in control and <el> insulin <le>-treated neurons. Analysis of newly synthesized proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that <el> insulin <le> uniformly increased the incorporation of 14C-leu into all of the resolved neuronal proteins. 
Extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma (NKTCL) is a rare but aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Multi-agent chemotherapy and involved-field radiotherapy are used to treat this disease, but the prognosis remains poor. Interleukin 13 and its receptors (<el> IL-13 <le>Rs) are correlated with the <re> pathogenesis <er> and progression of various malignances. However, their roles in NKTCL have not been evaluated. In this study, we examined the roles of <el> IL-13 <le> and <el> IL-13 <le>Rs in NKTCL and the underlying mechanisms. We found significantly higher serum <el> IL-13 <le> levels (p < 0.001) and <el> IL-13 <le>Rα1 expression in tumor tissues (36 of 40, p < 0.001) in patients with NKTCL than in control cohort. <el> IL-13 <le> secretion was observed in tumor tissues (30 of 40, p < 0.001) and several cell lines of NKTCL. However, we did not detect significant associations between clinical characteristics and the expression levels of <el> IL-13 <le> or <el> IL-13 <le>Rs. In vitro, <el> IL-13 <le> activated Stat6 and promoted cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, blocking <el> IL-13 <le> exerted a negative effect on tumor cell growth. 
N-Methyl-D-aspartate (<el> NMDA <le>) directly stimulates gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons to secrete GnRH. It is not known if this stimulatory effect of <el> NMDA <le> is mediated by NO. Northern blot analysis of the immortalized hypothalamic GnRH neuronal cells (GT1-1) mRNA with a neuronal NOS cDNA revealed this clonal cell line expressed neuronal NOS transcripts as a single 10.5-kb band. Immunoblot analysis of GT1-1 proteins with anti-neuronal NOS serum showed that the GT1-1 cells contain neuronal NOS. GT1-1 cells were used to study the effects of NO and <el> NMDA <le> on <re> GnRH release <er>. L-Arginine (10(-2) M), a precursor of NO enhances basal GnRH secretion. Both oxyhemoglobin (Hb)(10(-6)-10(-4) M), a NO scavenger and N omega-nitro-L-arginine (NNA)(10(-3),10(-2) M), a NOS inhibitor and inactivator block basal as well as <el> NMDA <le>-induced <re> GnRH release <er>. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) (10(-4), 10(-3) M), a NO donor stimulates <re> GnRH release <er>, an effect inhibited by Hb. Incubation of GT1-1 cells in Ca(2+)-free medium abolished the stimulatory effect of <el> NMDA <le> on <re> GnRH release <er>. In contrast, incubation in medium with increasing concentrations of Ca2+ enhances basal <re> GnRH release <er> as well as augments <el> NMDA <le>-mediated <re> GnRH release <er>. The results demonstrate that L-arginine-NO pathway is functional in the GT1-1 cells and an increase in intracellular Ca2+ [Ca2+]i following <el> NMDA <le> receptor activation activates NOS to generate NO. 
We investigated the long-term outcome, the incidence of second neoplasms (SN) and the rate of late adverse effects (LAE) in children with central nervous system (<el> CNS <le>) negative medium/high-risk de novo acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (<re> ALL <er>), in first complete remission (CR1) at end of late intensification, randomized to receive no cranial radiotherapy (No CRT, n = 92) versus CRT (standard arm, n = 84) in the non-inferiority EORTC 58832 study (1983-1989). Median follow-up was 20 years (range 4-32 years). The 25-year disease-free survival rate (±SE) was 67·4 ± 4·9% without CRT and 70·2 ± 5·0% with CRT. The 25-year incidence of isolated (6·5 ± 2·6% vs. 4·8 ± 2·3%) and any <el> CNS <le> relapse {8·7 ± 2·9% vs. 11·9 ± 3·5%; hazard ratio (HR) 0·71 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0·28-1·79]; test of non-inferiority: P = 0·01} was not increased without CRT. The 25-year SN incidence in CR1 was 7·9 ± 4·6% vs. 11·0 ± 4·2%. The 25-year event-free and overall survival rates were quite similar in both arms [59·5 ± 6·3% vs. 60·5 ± 5·9%, HR 0·94 (95% CI 0·57-1·52), and 78·1 ± 4·3% vs. 78·5 ± 4·5%, HR 1·00 (95% CI 0·53-1·88)]. Omission of CRT was associated with dramatic decrease in <el> CNS <le> and endocrine LAE rates. 
Effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (<el> 5-HT <le>) and related agonists and antagonists on formation of <re> cAMP <er> were determined for enzymatically dissociated ganglia from the myenteric plexus of the guinea-pig small intestine. Formation of <re> cAMP <er> was stimulated by <el> 5-HT <le> in both dose- and time- dependent manners. The stimulatory action of <el> 5-HT <le> was suppressed by the <el> 5-HT <le>1P antagonist, renzapride, but not by the <el> 5-HT <le>3 antagonist, tropisetron (formerly ICS 205-930). Neither renzapride nor cisapride increased the levels of <re> cAMP <er>. Levels of <re> cAMP <er> were suppressed by concentrations of tropisetron greater than 1.0 microM. Levels of <re> cAMP <er> were unaffected by the <el> 5-HT <le>3 agonist, 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine. A putative <el> 5-HT <le>4 receptor agonist, 5-methoxytryptamine, stimulated formation of <re> cAMP <er>, but to a lesser extent than <el> 5-HT <le>. 
Numerous studies have focused on the regulatory functions of <re> ICP27 <er>, an immediate-early (IE) protein of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). However, its homolog in HSV-2, termed <el> <re> ICP27 <er>t2 <le>, has been little studied. Here, we used two different approaches to functionally compare <el> <re> ICP27 <er>t2 <le> and <re> ICP27 <er>. In transfection-based assays, <el> <re> ICP27 <er>t2 <le> closely resembled <re> ICP27 <er> in its capacity to enhance HSV-1 late gene expression, suppress the splicing of a viral intron, and complement the growth of an HSV-1 <re> ICP27 <er> null mutant. To study <el> <re> ICP27 <er>t2 <le> in the context of viral infection, we engineered K2F1, an HSV-1 mutant that encodes <el> <re> ICP27 <er>t2 <le> in place of <re> ICP27 <er>. In Vero cells, K2F1 replicated with wild-type (WT) kinetics and yields, expressed delayed-early and late proteins normally, and was fully capable of activating several cellular signal transduction pathways that are <re> ICP27 <er> dependent. 
The capacity of the preimplantation embryo to undergo apoptosis in response to external stimuli is developmentally regulated. Acquisition of apoptosis does not occur in the cow embryo until between the 8- and 16-cell stages. The purpose of the present experiments was to determine the mechanism by which apoptosis is blocked in the bovine two-cell embryo. Heat <el> shock <le> (41 degrees C for 15 h) did not increase activity of <re> caspase <er>-9 or group II <re> caspase <er>s (<re> caspase <er>-2, -3, and -7) in two-cell embryos but did in day 5 embryos. Exposure of embryos to carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) to depolarize mitochondria resulted in activation of <re> caspase <er>-9 and group II <re> caspase <er>s at both stages of development. For day 5 embryos, CCCP also increased the proportion of blastomeres that underwent DNA fragmentation as determined by the TUNEL assay. In contrast, CCCP did not increase TUNEL labeling when applied at the two-cell stage. 
The difference between the PCO2 of alkalinized urine and the PCO2 of blood has been proposed as an indirect means of assessing distal nephron H+ secretion. Following oral bicarbonate loading and alkalinization of the urine to pH greater than or equal to 7.2, eight of nine children with chronic <el> hydronephrosis <le> and four children with idiopathic distal <re> RTA <er> had low (U-B)PCO2 values when compared with seven normal subjects. 
The collapse of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is one of the fundamental pathophysiology changes during cerebral <re> ischemia <er> reperfusion injury. Resveratrol has been recently reported to reduce cerebral ischemic damage by regulating the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). But, more direct evidence for the explanation of the BBB protected by <el> resveratrol <le> against cerebral <re> ischemia <er> reperfusion is still lacking. Therefore, the present study was aimed to investigate the regulation of BBB integrity by <el> resveratrol <le> after cerebral <re> ischemia <er> reperfusion and to determine the role of the MMP-9 and its endogenous inhibitor TIMP-1 balance in this process. Cerebral <re> ischemia <er> was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. The BBB function was evaluated by brain water content and the Evans blue dye extravasation; the activities of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were detected by using gelatin zymography analysis, and cellular apoptosis was examined by TUNEL staining. We confirmed that <el> resveratrol <le> reduced the cerebral <re> ischemia <er> reperfusion damage, brain edema, and Evans blue dye extravasation. Moreover, we found that <el> resveratrol <le> improved the balance of MMP-9/TIMP-1 in terms of their expressions and activities. A TIMP-1 neutralizing antibody reversed those neuroprotective effects of <el> resveratrol <le>. 
Increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a common denominative pathogenic mechanism underlying vascular and renal complications in diabetes mellitus. Endothelial NAD(P)H oxidase is a major source of vascular ROS, and it has an important role in endothelial dysfunction. We hypothesized that activation of endothelial NAD(P)H oxidase initiates and worsens the progression of <re> diabetic nephropathy <er>, particularly in the development of albuminuria. We used transgenic mice with endothelial-targeted overexpression of the catalytic subunit of NAD(P)H oxidase, Nox2 (NOX2TG). NOX2TG mice were crossed with Akita insulin-dependent diabetic (Akita) mice that develop progressive <el> hyperglycemia <le>. We compared the progression of <re> diabetic nephropathy <er> in Akita versus NOX2TG-Akita mice. NOX2TG-Akita mice and Akita mice developed significant albuminuria above the baseline at 6 and 10 weeks of age, respectively. Compared with Akita mice, NOX2TG-Akita mice exhibited higher levels of NAD(P)H oxidase activity in glomeruli, developed glomerular endothelial perturbations, and attenuated expression of glomerular glycocalyx. Moreover, in contrast to Akita mice, the NOX2TG-Akita mice had numerous endothelial microparticles (blebs), as detected by scanning electron microscopy, and increased glomerular permeability. Furthermore, NOX2TG-Akita mice exhibited distinct phenotypic changes in glomerular mesangial cells expressing α-smooth muscle actin, and in podocytes expressing increased levels of desmin, whereas the glomeruli generated increased levels of ROS. 
Inhibition of calmodulin (CaM) sensitizes <el> Ca2 <le>+ release mediated by D-myo-inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (<re> InsP3 <er>) in Xenoplus oocytes, which results in spontaneous <el> Ca2 <le>+ -dependent Cl- current oscillations or in a shift of the concentration threshold for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) by a tenfold factor. The oscillatory currents appear at a low initial <el> Ca2 <le>+ concentration and without any significant increase in the inositol phosphate (InsPs) concentrations. These data led us to rule out the direct involvement of CaM, as well as the implied involvement of <re> InsP3 <er> 3-kinase. The response to intracellular injection of the non-metabolizable <re> InsP3 <er> analog 3-deoxy-3-fluoro <re> InsP3 <er> (<re> InsP3 <er>-F) is obviously affected by previous treatment with CaM inhibitory peptide. Furthermore, these effects have been consistently obtained with specific CaMKII inhibitors such as KN-93 and AIP. CaM plays a key role in the <el> Ca2 <le>+-dependent inactivation of type I <re> InsP3 <er> receptors. The experiments presented hereby allow us to postulate that CaM could also exert its inhibitory effect through CaMKII in a way that does not involve <re> InsP3 <er> metabolism regulation. 
The contributions of electrogenic sodium/calcium exchange current (INaCa), calcium-activated chloride conductance [ICl(<el> Ca <le>)], and calcium-activated nonselective cation conductance to delayed afterdepolarizations (<re> DAD <er>) were examined. Nonselective cation channels were absent in canine M cells, since inhibition of INaCa and ICl(<el> Ca <le>) eliminated all calcium-activated currents without abolishing cell shortening. After the cells were treated with isoproterenol and ouabain to increase calcium loading, INaCa was 168 +/- 30 x 10(-3) pC/pF and ICl(<el> Ca <le>) was 114 +/- 24 x 10(-3) pC/pF. Transient overlapping inward and outward currents were evoked positive to the chloride reversal potential (ECl). Outward current was chloride sensitive, and inward current was blocked by replacement of external sodium with lithium. When ECl was -50 mV, triggered activity occurred in normal external sodium and persisted after inhibition of INaCa. Steps to -80 mV revealed oscillating inward currents in normal sodium and chloride, which persisted after inhibition of INaCa. When ECl was equal to -113 mV, ICl(<el> Ca <le>) opposed INaCa at the resting potential. <re> DAD <er> occurred in normal sodium, and inhibition of outward ICl(<el> Ca <le>) provoked triggered activity. 
<el> SIAH-1 <le> (seven in absentia homologue-1) is an E3-ubiquitin ligase that facilitates labelling and subsequent proteasomal degradation of different proteins like transcription factors (e.g. c-myb) and coactivators (e.g. beta-catenin). Here we show that <el> SIAH-1 <le> expression is frequently reduced in human hepatocarcinogenesis. However, further reduction of <el> SIAH-1 <le> bioavailability by gene-specific siRNA (RNAinterference) in <re> HCC <er> cell lines resulted in significantly decreased tumor cell viability. 
The structural and accessory proteins of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 are expressed by unspliced or partially spliced mRNAs. Efficient transport of these mRNAs from the nucleus requires the binding of the viral nuclear transport protein Rev to an RNA stem-loop structure called the RRE (Rev response element). However, the RRE does not permit Rev to stimulate the export of unspliced mRNAs from the efficiently spliced beta-<re> globin <er> gene in the absence of additional cis-acting RNA regulatory signals. The p17gag gene instability (INS) element contains RNA elements that can complement Rev activity. In the presence of the INS element and the RRE, Rev permits up to 30 % of the total beta-<re> globin <er> mRNA to be exported to the cytoplasm as unspliced mRNA. Here, we show that a minimal sequence of 30 nt derived from the 5' end of the p17 gag gene INS element (5' INS) is functional and permits the export to the cytoplasm of 14% of the total beta-<re> globin <er> mRNA as unspliced pre-mRNA. Gel mobility shift assays and UV cross-linking experiments have shown that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (<el> hnRNP <le>) A1 and a cellular RNA-binding protein of 50 kDa form a complex on the 5' INS. Mutants in the 5' INS that prevent <el> hnRNP <le> A1 and 50 kDa protein binding are inactive in the transport assay. To confirm that the <el> hnRNP <le> A1 complex is responsible for INS activity, a synthetic high-affinity binding site for <el> hnRNP <le> A1 was also analysed. When the high affinity <el> hnRNP <le> A1 binding site was inserted into the beta-<re> globin <er> reporter, Rev was able to increase the cytoplasmic levels of unspliced mRNAs to 14%. In contrast, the mutant <el> hnRNP <le> A1 binding site, or binding sites for <el> hnRNP <le> C and L are unable to stimulate Rev-mediated RNA transport. 
Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are the most common cause of bacterial diarrhea in young children in developing countries and in travelers. Efforts to develop an ETEC vaccine have intensified in the past decade, and intestinal colonization factors (CFs) are somatic components of most investigational vaccines. CFA/I and related Class 5 fimbrial CFs feature a major stalk-forming subunit and a minor, antigenically conserved tip adhesin. We hypothesized that the tip adhesin is critical for stimulating antibodies that specifically inhibit ETEC attachment to the small intestine. To address this, we compared the capacity of donor strand complemented CfaE (<el> dscCfaE <le>), a stabilized form of the CFA/I fimbrial tip adhesin, and CFA/I fimbriae to elicit anti-adhesive antibodies in mice, using hemagglutination inhibition (<re> HAI <er>) as proxy for neutralization of intestinal adhesion. When given with genetically attenuated heat-labile enterotoxin LTR192G as adjuvant by intranasal (IN) or orogastric (OG) vaccination, <el> dscCfaE <le> exceeded CFA/I fimbriae in eliciting serum <re> HAI <er> titers and anti-CfaE antibody titers. Based on these findings, we vaccinated Aotus nancymaae nonhuman primates (NHP) with <el> dscCfaE <le> alone or admixed with one of two adjuvants, LTR192G and cholera toxin B-subunit, by IN and OG administration. Only IN vaccination with <el> dscCfaE <le> with either adjuvant elicited substantial serum <re> HAI <er> titers and IgA and IgG anti-adhesin responses, with the latter detectable a year after vaccination. 
In the oral cavity, <el> titanium <le> is an excellent biocompatible material. However, it is reported that high ratios of intracellular <el> titanium <le> particles can cause cell apoptosis or <re> necrosis <er> by as-yet unknown mechanisms. The purpose of this study was to investigate the response of tumor <re> necrosis <er> factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-resistant L929 fibroblasts to <el> titanium <le> particles. Cells were cultured in Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum and L-glutamine. Titanium particle sizes were less than 9 micro. Cytotoxicity was assayed by a cell counting kit, trypan blue dye exclusion test and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected by a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) using dichlorofluorescein diacetate as a fluorescent probe. Morphology was viewed by a CLSM and with an X-ray microanalyser (XMA). When <el> titanium <le> particles were added to cells, the viability decreased to around 50% at a particle concentration of 2.0%. The number of dead cells and LDH activity in the culture media increased significantly between 1 and 2 days. However, formation of active oxygen species did not occur, since no dichlorofluorescein fluorescence was observed. A scanning electron photomicrograph (SEM) revealed a large number of particles covering or adhering to cellular components in lysed cells compared with flattened control cells attached to the substrate. The XMA showed that the <el> titanium <le> accumulation was coincident with the deformed cell shape. The CLSM also confirmed that particles were within the cells.

We conclude that 1) L-Arg inhibits <el> vasopressin <le>-stimulated murine and rat <re> MC <er> [Ca2+]i rise, 2) this inhibition is not mediated by metabolism of L-Arg to either NO or L-Orn, and 3) the effect of L-Arg is due to its cationic functional group, guanidine. positive
We conclude that 1) the elevated <el> MCVR <le> in the hypertensive rabbits is due mainly to a failure of the major resistance vessels to increase in size or number rather than to a decrease in vascular lumen diameter, and 2) <re> hypothyroidism <er> does not affect maximal myocardial perfusion or lumen diameter of resistance vessels but facilitates capillary growth. positive
These data suggest the following conclusions: (i) a pressure of 100 <el> MPa <le> induces spore germination by activating the <re> germinant receptors <er>; and (ii) a pressure of 550 <el> MPa <le> opens channels for release of dipicolinic acid from the spore core, which leads to the later steps in spore germination. positive

In conclusion, these results indicate that IMCLs relate to <el> insulin <le> resistance in type 2 diabetic patients at baseline and that <el> insulin <le>-mediated near-normoglycemia for approximately 3 days reduces fasting <re> glucose <er> production but stimulates lipid accumulation in liver and muscle without affecting <el> insulin <le> sensitivity. negative
The use of <el> MC <le> dose calculations leads to the same general conclusion as using <re> AAA <er> that a two arc delivery with limited collimator opening can provide the greatest amount of midline sparing compared to the other techniques investigated. positive

We conclude that whereas <el> thromboxane <le> A(2) causes intracellular calcium mobilization and shape change independently, <el> thromboxane <le> A(2)-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and <re> platelet aggregation <er> depends exclusively upon secretion of other agonists that stimulate G(i)-coupled receptors. negative

In conclusion, the results suggest that increased <el> cAMP <le> levels in response to PACAP27 negatively regulate ANP secretion via the <re> adenylate <er> cyclase-<el> cAMP <le>-PKA signalling pathway in rabbit atria and that L-type Ca2+ channels may be involved, in part, in the regulation of ANP secretion by <el> cAMP <le>. negative
It is concluded that the inhibitory action of secretin on pentagastrin-stimulated <re> gastric acid secretion <er> is mediated by both <el> somatostatin <le> and prostaglandins in conscious rats. positive
In conclusion, post-transplant <el> tumor <le> immunization of allogeneic BMT recipients against either a leukemia or a solid <el> tumor <le> can increase <re> GVT <er> activity and survival without exacerbating GVHD. positive
In conclusion, MSLN enhances ovarian cancer <re> invasion <er> by <el> MMP-7 <le> expression through the MAPK/ERK and JNK signal transduction pathways. positive
These results invalidate earlier conclusions (Grant and Canvin, 1970) that <el> NO <le> 2 (-) inhibits photosynthesis by preventing <re> NADP <er> reduction. negative
In conclusion, these in vitro studies demonstrated that <el> ACTH <le> suppressed basal <re> CRH secretion <er> in a dose-dependent manner, an effect compatible with a short-loop feedback mechanism. negative
We conclude that nLDL enhances <el> TRAP <le>-induced <re> fibrinogen <er> binding independent of LPA. positive
We conclude from these data that 1) <el> insulin <le> rapidly stimulates overall <re> protein synthesis <er> in fetal neurons independent of amino acid uptake and aminoacyl tRNA precursor pools; 2) stimulation of <re> protein synthesis <er> is mediated by the brain subtype of <el> insulin <le> receptor; and 3) <el> insulin <le> is potentially an important in vivo growth factor for fetal central nervous system neurons. positive
We conclude that <el> IL-13 <le> functions as an autocrine growth factor in NKTCL and contributes to its <re> pathogenesis <er>. positive
We conclude that endogenous NO mediates, at least in part, basal as well as <el> NMDA <le>-stimulated <re> GnRH release <er> and may play a role as an intercellular messenger in synchronizing pulsatile <re> GnRH release <er>. positive
In conclusion, our data suggest that, with proper systemic and intrathecal <el> CNS <le> prophylaxis, CRT could totally be omitted in CR1 without jeopardizing survival, while decreasing LAE in childhood <re> ALL <er>. negative
We conclude that <el> 5-HT <le> acts to stimulate adenylate cyclase and the formation of <re> cAMP <er> in myenteric ganglia. positive

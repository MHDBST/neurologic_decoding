The effects of a novel chemical type of dopamine receptor antagonist, the tetrahydroprotoberberine analogs (THPBs), on acetylcholine ( ACh )-induced current were studied in freshly dissociated pyramidal neurons from rat hippocampal CA1 area using the nystatin perforated patch-clamp recording technique. Under voltage clamp conditions, the ACh -induced outward current (IACh) is sensitive to the muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine and the K+ channel blocker, TEA. The reversal potential of IACh (-84.1 +/- 0.8 mV) is close to the K+ equilibrium potential, indicating that the IACh is mediated by a muscarinic receptor, and is carried mainly by K+. Tetrahydroberberine (THB) markedly reduced the IACh while its chemical analogs, l-stepholidine (l-SPD) or l-tetrahydropalmatine (l-THP), had little effect on the IACh. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of THB was 1.3 x 10(-5) M for a 10(-5) M ACh -induced IACh. THB suppressed the maximum of the ACh concentration-response curve without shifting the Hill coefficient, indicating a non-competitive inhibition.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We investigated whether the pathways linked to Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 (TLRs) are involved in renal ischemia-reperfusion ( I/R )-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Wild type (WT) C57BL/6J, TLR2-/- and TLR4-/- mice were subjected to left kidney ischemia for 60 min followed by reperfusion for 5, 8, 12 and 15 days. Proton density magnetic resonance showed alterations in the injured kidney from WT mice, together with signs of parenchymal edema and higher levels of vimentin mRNA, accompanied by: (i) small, but significant, increase in serum urea after 24 h, (ii) 100% increase in serum creatinine at 24 h. A serum peak of inflammatory cytokines occurred after 5 days of reperfusion. Heart weight/body weight and heart weight/tibia length ratios increased after 12 and 15 days of reperfusion, respectively. Cardiac hypertrophy markers, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and -actin, left ventricle mass, cardiac wall thickness and myocyte width increased after 15 days of reperfusion, together with longer QTc and action potential duration. Cardiac TLRs, MyD88, HSP60 and HSP70 mRNA levels also increased. After 15 days of reperfusion, absence of TLRs prevented cardiac hypertrophy, as reflected by similar values of left ventricular cardiac mass and heart weight/body weight ratio compared to the transgenic Sham. Renal tissular injury also ameliorated in both knockout mice, as revealed by the comparison of their vimentin mRNA levels with those found in the WT on the same day after I/R. The I/R TLR2-/- group had TNF-, IFN- and IL-1 levels similar to the non- I/R group, whereas the TLR4-/- group conserved the p-NF-B/NF- B ratio contrasting with that found in TLR2-/-.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Iron deficiency has been associated with kidney injury. Deferasirox is an oral iron chelator used to treat blood transfusion-related iron overload. Nephrotoxicity is the most serious and common adverse effect of deferasirox and may present as an acute or chronic kidney disease. However, scarce data are available on the molecular mechanisms of nephrotoxicity. We explored the therapeutic modulation of deferasirox -induced proximal tubular cell death in culture. Deferasirox induced dose-dependent tubular cell death and AnexxinV/7AAD staining showed features of apoptosis and necrosis. However, despite inhibiting caspase-3 activation, the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk failed to prevent deferasirox -induced cell death. Moreover, zVAD increased deferasirox -induced cell death, a feature sometimes found in necroptosis. Electron microscopy identified mitochondrial injury and features of necrosis. However, neither necrostatin-1 nor RIP3 knockdown prevented deferasirox -induced cell death. Deferasirox caused BclxL depletion and BclxL overexpression was protective.

The elevated levels of circulating catecholamines ( CA s) with age may be related to the increased expression of CA biosynthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine beta hydroxylase (DbetaH) in the adrenal medulla of senescent compared with younger animals. Neuropeptide Y ( NPY ) is co-synthesized and co-released with CA s in the adrenal medulla. NPY inhibits the stimulated secretion of CA s, however, its role in regulation of the genes encoding CA biosynthetic enzymes is not clear. We hypothesized that NPY up-regulates TH, DbetaH and NPY expression in the adrenal medullae of young and old Fischer-344 rats. NPY increased mRNA expression of TH, DbetaH, NPY and also enhanced TH protein level in the adrenal medullae of young rats by 50%, 35%, 45% and by 20%, respectively. We also examined the effect of NPY on TH and NPY mRNA in the hypothalamus. Basal expression of TH mRNA was decreased in the hypothalamus with age.

Cyclooxygenase-2, the inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase, is highly expressed in microglial cells activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide and is a major regulatory factor in the synthesis of prostanoids, such as prostaglandins, prostacyclin and thromboxanes. Since prostanoids are potent modulators of inflammation, immune responses and neurotoxicity, the regulation of their synthesis may be crucial for balancing microglial neuroprotective and neurotoxic activities. The present study shows that expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and prostanoid production in cultured rat microglia activated by lipopolysaccharide is up-regulated by cyclic AMP (cAMP), as indicated by experiments performed in the presence of adenylyl cyclase activators, cAMP analogues and protein kinase A-specific inhibitors. Exogenous prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ), which elevates the cAMP level in microglial cells, also increased the lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and production of thromboxane in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The observations that the lipopolysaccharide-induced prostanoid production was specifically increased by 11-deoxy-16,16-dm PGE2, a selective agonist at the PGE2 receptor EP2 coupled to the activation of adenylyl cyclase, and that the enhancing effect of PGE2 was partially prevented by specific inhibitors of adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase A, suggest that the up-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 expression by PGE2 is mediated by cAMP, through a putative microglial EP2 receptor.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
In conclusion, while the strong up-regulation of <re> cyclooxygenase-2 expression <er> by exogenous <el> PGE2 <le> appears to be mediated by EP2 receptors and cAMP, the limited down-regulation caused by anti-inflammatory drug treatments may be either due to arachidonic acid metabolites other than <el> PGE2 <le>, or to <el> PGE2 <le> itself, acting through a distinct cAMP-independent signalling pathway. positive----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) pathogenesis involves binding of anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) autoantibodies ( NMO-IgG ) present in serum to AQP4 on astrocytes, which causes complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Human immunoglobulin G ( hIgG ) is effective for treatment of humorally mediated neurological autoimmune diseases and has been reported to improve disease outcome in a limited number of NMO patients. Here, we investigated hIgG actions on NMO-IgG pathogenicity using an in vivo rat model of NMO and in vitro assays. In rats administered NMO-IgG by intracerebral injection, the size of neuroinflammatory demyelinating lesions was reduced by 50% when hIgG was administered by intraperitoneal injection to reach levels of 10-25mg/mL in rat serum, comparable with human therapeutic levels. In vitro, hIgG at 10mg/mL reduced by 90% NMO-IgG -mediated CDC following addition of NMO-IgG and human complement to AQP4-expressing cells. The hIgG effect was mainly on the classical complement pathway. hIgG at 10mg/mL also reduced by up to 90% NMO-IgG -mediated ADCC as assayed with human natural killer cells as effector cells. However, hIgG at up to 40mg/mL did not affect AQP4 cell surface expression or its supramolecular assembly in orthogonal arrays of particles, nor did it affect NMO-IgG binding to AQP4.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory dermatosis, is frequently associated with metabolic disorders, suggesting that adipokines are involved in its pathogenesis. We recently reported that the adipokine visfatin activates NF-B and STAT3 in keratinocytes. Antimicrobial peptide expression is enhanced in psoriatic lesions and may promote disease development. Here, we investigated the effects of visfatin on antimicrobial peptide expression. In vitro, visfatin enhanced basal and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-)-induced mRNA expression and secretion of cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (CAMP), and enhanced TNF--induced human -defensin-2 (hBD-2), hBD-3, and S100A7 mRNA expression and secretion in human keratinocytes. siRNAs targeting CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein- (C/EBP) suppressed visfatin -induced and visfatin plus TNF--induced CAMP production. siRNAs targeting NF-B p65 and STAT3 suppressed visfatin plus TNF--induced hBD-2 and S100A7 production. siRNAs targeting c-Jun and STAT3 suppressed visfatin plus TNF--induced hBD-3 production. Visfatin and/or TNF- enhanced C/EBP transcriptional activity and C/EBP phosphorylation, which were suppressed by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibition.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal malignancies due to its high frequency of metastasis via the epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) pathway. Hepatic stimulator substance (HSS) can protect hepatocytes from injury and promote liver growth. Recent studies indicated that HSS expression is increased in HCC tissues; however, whether HSS expression is potentially associated with HCC metastasis, particularly through the EMT pathway, remains largely unknown. In this study, the relationship between HSS expression and HCC metastasis was investigated in clinical samples of HCC. Meanwhile, the regulation of HCC metastasis and EMT progression by HSS were also analyzed in both in vitro and in vivo models. The results showed that the expression of 23 kDa HSS was significantly decreased among HCC tissues with angioinvasion. A decrease in HSS predicted poor prognosis with a lower survival rate. Furthermore, the growth of xenograft tumors after inoculating MHCC97H-HSS-shRNA (HCC) cells into nude mice was notably accelerated compared to those inoculated with HSS-expressing cells. Further analysis revealed that knockdown of HSS expression in both MHCC97H and HepG2 cells could enhance the migration of these HCC cells. Concurrently, interference of HSS expression by shRNA promoted conversion of morphologically epithelial-like HCC cells into mesenchymal-like cells, together with downregulations of epithelial markers (such as E-cadherin and zonula occludens-1) and upregulation of mesenchymal-like makers (such as -SMA, -catenin, and fibronectin). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that, as well as promoting EMT, HSS-shRNA induced the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) and elevated the expression of the EMT -related transcription factor Snail.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Exposure to hypoxia during the first weeks of life in newborn rats decreases vascular growth and alveolarization and causes pulmonary hypertension (PH). BAY 41-2272 is a novel direct activator of soluble guanylate cyclase independent of nitric oxide, effective as an acute pulmonary vasodilator in an animal model of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, but whether prolonged BAY 41-2272 therapy is effective in the setting of chronic PH is unknown. We hypothesize that BAY 41-2272 would prevent PH induced by chronic exposure to neonatal hypoxia. At 2 days of age, newborn rats were randomly exposed to hypoxia (FiO2, 0.12) or room air, and received daily intramuscular treatment with BAY 41-2272 (1 mg/kg) or saline. After 2 weeks, rats were killed for assessment of right ventricular hypertrophy ( RVH ), wall thickness of small pulmonary arteries, vessels density, radial alveolar counts and mean linear intercepts. In comparison with control, hypoxia increased RVH and artery wall thickness, reduced vessels density, decreased radial alveolar counts and increased mean linear intercepts. In comparison with hypoxic controls, prolonged BAY 41-2272 treatment during chronic hypoxia reduced RVH (0.67 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.52 +/- 0.05; p  0.05), and attenuated artery wall thickness (48.2 +/- 2.8% vs. 35.7 +/- 4.1 microm; p  0.01).

The insulin -like growth factor, multiplication stimulating activity (MSA), and insulin were recently shown to stimulate proteoglycan synthesis in monolayer cultures of chondrocytes derived from the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma. Insulin produced significant stimulation at a concentration of less than 1 ng/ml, suggesting that insulin was acting through the insulin receptor rather than through a somatomedin receptor. In this paper we have shown that the insulin -like growth factors IGF-I and IGF-II also are potent stimulators of [35S]sulfate incorporation into macromolecules recovered from the medium and cell layer matrix of the chondrosarcoma chondrocytes. Proinsulin was 3% as potent as insulin in stimulating [35S]sulfate incorporation. We identified receptors for insulin and the insulin -like growth factors, MSA, IGF-I, and IGF-II. Insulin, at concentrations 1000 times the concentration required to produce the biologic response, did not compete for binding of 125I-MSA-II-1 or of 125I-IGF-II and only partially competed for 125I-IGF-I binding. Anti- insulin receptor IgG stimulated proteoglycan synthesis and competed for 125I- insulin binding. Fab fragment prepared from anti- insulin receptor IgG completely blocked the stimulation of [35S]sulfate incorporation into macromolecules by insulin while only partially inhibiting the biologic response to insulin -like growth factors, MSA, IGF-I, and IGF-II. Similarly, the anti- insulin receptor IgG only partially inhibited the binding of 125I-IGF-I and 125I-IGF-II while completely blocking the binding of 125I- insulin.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Little is known about the effect of hormones on the photosynthetic process. Therefore, we studied Rubisco content and expression along with gas exchange parameters in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants that are not able to sense ethylene. We also tested for a possible interaction between ethylene insensitivity, abscisic acid ( ABA ), and sugar feedback on photosynthesis. We measured Rubisco content in seedlings grown in agar with or without added sugar and fluridone, and Rubisco expression in hydroponically grown vegetative plants grown at low and high CO(2). Furthermore, we analyzed gas exchange and the photosynthetic machinery of transformants and wild-type plants grown under standard conditions. In the presence of exogenous glucose ( Glc ), agar-grown seedlings of the ethylene-insensitive genotype had lower amounts of Rubisco per unit leaf area than the wild type. No differences in Rubisco content were found between ethylene-insensitive and wild-type seedlings treated with fluridone, suggesting that inhibition of ABA production nullified the effect of Glc application. When larger, vegetative plants were grown at different atmospheric CO(2) concentrations, a negative correlation was found between Glc concentration in the leaves and Rubisco gene expression, with stronger repression by high Glc concentrations in ethylene-insensitive plants. Ethylene insensitivity resulted in plants with comparable fractions of nitrogen invested in light harvesting, but lower amounts in electron transport and Rubisco. Consequently, photosynthetic capacity of the insensitive genotype was clearly lower compared with the wild type.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Activation of Kupffer cells by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plays a pivotal role in the onset of pathophysiological events that occur during endotoxemia and intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) is involved in LPS-stimulated cytokine production. Recently, it was shown that Kupffer cells contain a glycine-gated chloride channel. Because taurine, a ubiquitous sulfur-containing beta-amino acid, acts similarly to glycine in neurons by causing hyperpolarization, it was hypothesized that taurine would act via a similar mechanism, blunting the LPS-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in Kupffer cells. To test this hypothesis, Kupffer cells were isolated from female Sprague-Dawley rats and cultured for 24 h. LPS-induced changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored fluorometrically in single cells, whereas levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) released by Kupffer cells after exposure to LPS were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Taurine significantly blunted the LPS-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in a dose-dependent manner (IC50, 0.1 mM). This effect was reversed by strychnine (1 microM) and was prevented when chloride was removed from the extracellular media. Moreover, taurine increased 36Cl- uptake by Kupffer cells in a dose-dependent manner (EC50, 0.2 mM). Furthermore, strychnine (1 microM) reversed the effect of taurine on 36Cl- uptake. These results indicate that taurine activates a glycine-gated chloride channel in Kupffer cells causing chloride influx. In addition, LPS-induced TNF-alpha production was reduced by more than 40% by taurine, an effect that was also reversed by strychnine.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Nucleoredoxin (NXN) is a redox-regulating protein potentially targeted by reactive oxygen species (ROS). It regulates molecular pathways that participate in several key cellular processes. However, the role of NXN in the alcohol liver disease (ALD) redox regulation has not been fully understood. Here, we investigated the effects of ethanol and ethanol plus lipopolysaccharide, a two-hit liver injury model (Ethanol/LPS), on NXN/dishevelled (DVL) interaction and on DVL-dependent phosphoinositides production both in mouse liver and in a co-culture system consisting of human hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and ethanol metabolizing-VL17A human hepatocyte cells. Ethanol and two-hit model increased Nxn protein and mRNA expression, and 4-hydroxynonenal adducts. Two-hit model promoted Nxn nuclear translocation and Dvl/Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type-II (Pi4k2a) interaction ratio but surprisingly decreased Dvl protein and mRNA levels and reverted ethanol -induced Nxn/Dvl and Dvl/frizzled (Fzd) interaction ratios. Ethanol resulted in a significant increase of Dvl protein and mRNA expression, and decreased Nxn/Dvl interaction ratio but promoted the interaction of Dvl with Fzd and Pi4k2a; formation of this complex induced phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [ PI (4)P] production. Ethanol and LPS treatments provoked similar alterations on NXN/DVL interaction and its downstream effect in HSC/VL17A co-culture system. Interestingly, ROS and glutathione levels as well as most of ethanol -induced alterations were modified by NXN overexpression in the co-culture system.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We sought to determine whether systemic administration of protease s ameliorates membranous nephritis induced in rats by immunization and challenge with cationic bovine gamma globulin, and whether targeting of protease to glomerular capillaries increases efficacy. Proteases substituted with biotin were targeted via the cationic protein avidin A, which by virtue of its charge has affinity for the glomerular basement membrane. Despite identical pretreatment proteinuria, rats given untargeted protease (biotin-conjugated without avidin, or unconjugated plus avidin) had significantly less proteinuria than saline-treated controls and nephrotic rats given avidin plus biotin-conjugated (targeted) protease had even less proteinuria and reduced glomerular rat IgG and C3. Among more severely nephrotic rats, targeted protease was again more effective than untargeted protease at reducing proteinuria, and also decreased the size of electron-dense glomerular deposits, hypercholesterolemia, and creatininemia.

The anticancer drug mitomycin C produces cytotoxic effects after being converted to a highly reactive bis-electrophile by a reductive activation, a reaction that a number of 1-electron or 2-electron oxidoreductase enzymes can perform in cells. Several reports in the literature indicate that ascorbic acid can modulate the cytotoxic effects of mitomycin C, either potentiating or inhibiting its effects. As ascorbic acid is a reducing agent that is known to be able to reduce quinones, it could be possible that the observed modulatory effects are a consequence of a direct redox reduction between mitomycin C and ascorbate. To determine if this is the case, the reaction between mitomycin C and ascorbate was studied using UV/Vis spectroscopy and LC/MS. We also studied the reaction of ascorbate with mitomycin A, a highly toxic member of the mitomycin family with a higher redox potential than mitomycin C. We found that ascorbate is capable to reduce mitomycin A efficiently, but it reduces mitomycin C rather inefficiently. The mechanisms of activation have been elucidated based on the kinetics of the reduction and on the analysis of the mitosene derivatives formed after the reaction. We found that the activation occurs by the interplay of three different mechanisms that contribute differently, depending on the pH of the reaction.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
As the reduction of <re> mitomycin C <er> by <el> ascorbate <le> is rather inefficiently at physiologically relevant pH values we conclude that the modulatory effect of <el> ascorbate <le> on the cytotoxicity of <re> mitomycin C <er> is not the result of a direct redox reaction and therefore this modulation must be the consequence of other biochemical mechanisms. negative----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to induce a rapid antidepressant effect in treatment-resistant patients. Vortioxetine is a multimodal-acting antidepressant that exert its therapeutic activity through serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibition and modulation of several 5-HT receptors. In clinical trials, vortioxetine improves depression symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. Neuroplasticity as well as serotonergic and glutamatergic signaling attain significant roles in depression pathophysiology and antidepressant responses. Here, we investigate the effects of ketamine and vortioxetine on gene expression related to serotonergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission as well as neuroplasticity and compare them to those of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. Rats were injected with fluoxetine (10mg/kg), ketamine (15mg/kg), or vortioxetine (10mg/kg) at 2, 8, 12, or 27h prior to harvesting of the frontal cortex and hippocampus. mRNA levels were measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The main finding was that vortioxetine enhanced plasticity-related gene expression (Mtor, Mglur1, Pkc, Homer3, Spinophilin, and Synapsin3) in the frontal cortex at 8h after a single dose. Ingenuity pathway analysis of this subset of data identified a biological network that was engaged by vortioxetine and is plausibly associated with neuroplasticity. Transcript levels had returned to baseline levels 12h after injection. Only minor effects on gene expression were found for ketamine or fluoxetine.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Cholic acid is a critical component of the lithogenic diet in mice. To determine its pathogenetic roles, we fed chow or 1% cholesterol with or without 0.5% cholic acid to C57L/J male mice, which because of lith genes have 100% gallstone prevalence rates. After 1 yr on the diets, we measured bile flow, biliary lipid secretion rates, hepatic cholesterol and bile salt synthesis, and intestinal cholesterol absorption. After hepatic conjugation with taurine, cholate replaced most tauro-beta-muricholate in bile. Dietary cholic acid plus cholesterol increased bile flow and biliary lipid secretion rates and reduced cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase activity significantly mostly via deoxycholic acid, cholate's bacterial 7alpha-dehydroxylation product but did not downregulate cholesterol biosynthesis. Intestinal cholesterol absorption doubled, and biliary cholesterol crystallized as phase boundaries shifted. Feeding mice 1% cholesterol alone produced no lithogenic or homeostatic effects.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Besides its role in body weight control leptin may also act as a vasoactive hormone. This study was designed to investigate whether leptin modifies angiotensin II ( ANG II )-induced vascular responses. The expression of functional leptin receptors (OB-Rb) was detected in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from adult Wistar rats by RT-PCR. Immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis further showed the expression of OB-R protein in VSMCs. The ANG II (10(-7) mol/liter)-induced increase in intracellular Ca (2+) was blocked (P  0.01) by leptin (10(-8) mol/liter). Moreover, in calcium-free buffer leptin was able to inhibit 65% of the ANG II -induced calcium release from intracellular stores. In endothelium-denuded aortic rings from adult Wistar rats no effect of leptin on basal tension was observed. However, the ANG II -induced isometric contraction was reduced (P  0.05) by leptin (10(-8) mol/liter). The experiments were also performed in age- and sex-matched Zucker rats, in which no effect of leptin on ANG II -induced calcium increase and vasoconstriction was observed.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Aloe vera is a traditional woundhealing medicine used for the treatment of skin disorders. Aloe polysaccharide (APS) is the main macromolecule of Aloe vera, which contributes to its function. Psoriasis is an immunemediated chronic inflammatory disease, which affects 23% of the general population. The conventional remedies used to treat psoriasis demonstrate limited effects; therefore, natural products, including Aloe vera, are being taken into consideration. However, the effects of APS on the treatment of psoriasis and the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT was used to determine the effects of APS on psoriasis. Cells were randomly divided into five groups: i) Negative control group; ii) tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) stimulated psoriasis model group; and iii) APS (20, 40 and 80 g/ml) pretreated psoriasis groups. Cell viability and proliferation were investigated using the CCK8 assay. ELISA and western blotting were applied to study the abundance of interleukin (IL)8 and IL12 in TNF incubated culture medium and APStreated HaCaT cells, respectively. In addition, the mRNA expression levels of p65, and the protein expression levels of nuclear factor ( NF )B inhibitor (IB) and phosphorylatedp65, were detected by reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. APS was revealed to significantly reduce TNF stimulated elevation of HaCaT cell proliferation in a dosedependent manner. The expression levels of inflammatory factors, including IL8 and IL12, were increased in response to TNF.

Nerve growth factor ( NGF ) inhibits transepithelial HCO3- absorption in the rat medullary thick ascending limb (MTAL). To investigate the mechanism of this inhibition, MTALs were perfused in vitro in Na +-free solutions, and apical and basolateral membrane Na +/H+ exchange activities were determined from rates of pHi recovery after lumen or bath Na + addition. NGF (0.7 nM in the bath) had no effect on apical Na +/H+ exchange activity, but inhibited basolateral Na +/H+ exchange activity by 50%. Inhibition of basolateral Na +/H+ exchange activity with ethylisopropyl amiloride (EIPA) secondarily reduces apical Na +/H+ exchange activity and HCO3- absorption in the MTAL (Good, D. W., George, T., and Watts, B. A., III (1995) Proc. Na tl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 12525-12529). To determine whether a similar mechanism could explain inhibition of HCO3- absorption by NGF, apical Na +/H+ exchange activity was assessed in physiological solutions (146 mM Na +) by measurement of the initial rate of cell acidification after lumen EIPA addition. Under these conditions, in which basolateral Na +/H+ exchange activity is present, NGF inhibited apical Na +/H+ exchange activity. Inhibition of HCO3- absorption by NGF was eliminated in the presence of bath EIPA or in the absence of bath Na +.

The kidney is a main target organ for cadmium toxicity. The present study has been performed to test for effects of cadmium on electrical properties of cultured subconfluent kidney (MDCK) cells. Cadmium leads to a rapid, sustained and reversible hyperpolarization of the cell membrane, paralleled by an increase of the potassium selectivity and a decrease of the resistance. Thus, cadmium increases the potassium conductance of the cell membrane. The half maximal effect is elicited congruent to 0.2 microM, a concentration encountered during chronic cadmium intoxication. At extracellular calcium concentration reduced to less than 0.1 microM, 5 microM cadmium leads to a transient hyperpolarization, which can be elicited only once. High concentrations (50 microM) of cadmium lead to a sustained hyperpolarization even at extracellular calcium concentrations of less than 0.1 microM. According to fluorescence measurements cadmium leads to an increase of intracellular calcium activity, which is sustained at 1 mM and transient at less than 1 microM extracellular calcium activity.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Previous studies have shown that alteration of the dietary arginine-methionine balance by use of synthetic L-amino acids inhibits tumor growth of a subcutaneously transplanted Morris hepatoma at the expense of maintaining body weight. However, L-methionine is susceptible to degradation and, therefore, may contribute to a deficiency state. The present studies were performed to determine whether growth of subcutaneous hepatoma transplants is inhibited, and body growth maintained, when rats are fed diets containing L-methionine in replacement of N-acetyl- L-methionine (NALM) for 28 days. Tumor-free and tumor-bearing rats fed a control diet, with amino acids replacing protein, had gains in body weight: 31.3 +/- 1.0 and 19.1 +/- 0.5 g (12% and 7%), respectively. Rats fed six experimental diets, with varying L-arginine-NALM balances, had body weight gains ranging from 18.4 +/- 0.3 to 26.7 +/- 0.9 g (7-10%).

A neuroprotective role of autophagy mediates the degradation of -amyloid peptide (A) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The previous study showed cilostazol modulates autophagy by increasing beclin1, Atg5 and LC3-II expressions, and depletes intracellular A accumulation. This study elucidated the mechanisms through which cilostazol modulates the autophagic degradation of A in neurons. In N2a cells, cilostazol (10-30 M), significantly increased the expression of P-AMPK (Thr 172) and downstream P-ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) (Ser 79) as did resveratrol (SIRT1 activator), or AICAR (AMPK activator), which were blocked by KT5720, compound C (AMPK inhibitor), or sirtinol. Furthermore, phosphorylated-mTOR (Ser 2448) and phosphorylated-P70S6K (Thr 389) expressions were suppressed, and LC3-II levels were elevated in association with decreased P62/Sqstm1 by cilostazol. Cilostazol increased cathepsin B activity and decreased p62/SQSTM 1, consequently decreased accumulation of A1-42 in the activated N2aSwe cells, and these results were blocked by sirtinol, compound C and bafilomycin A1 (autophagosome blocker), suggesting enhanced autophagosome formation by cilostazol. In SIRT1 gene-silenced N2a cells, cilostazol failed to increase the expressions of P-LKB1 (Ser 428) and P-AMPK, which contrasted with its effect in negative control cells transfected with scrambled siRNA duplex.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The objective was to elucidate the effects of exogenous RA and a RA R  antagonist on gene expression of ALDH1, CYP26b1, RA R, cellular RA -binding protein II, and STRA8 in an in vitro organ culture model of canine testis. Testicular tissues from medium-sized mixed breed dogs (N = 5; age 8  0.17 mo) were subjected to exogenous all trans- RA (final concentrations of 1, 2, and 10 M, and DMSO as control) for 24 h. Similarly, testicular tissues were treated with Ro 41-5253 ( RA R  antagonist), at 1, 10, and 50 M final concentrations (DMSO as control) for 24 h. Exogenous RA or the RA R  antagonist decreased (P  0.05) mRNA abundance of ALDH1 in a dose-dependent manner compared with control. The CRABII mRNA abundance was greater after RA treatment compared with control (P  0.01), but only 50 M Ro 41-5253 effectively decreased CRABII mRNA abundance compared with control (P  0.01).

Neuroinflammatory diseases are associated with increased production of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and excessive generation of nitric oxide (NO). NO has been reported to have variable effects on MMP-9 gene expression and activation in various cell types. In the present study, we investigated the effect of NOon MMP-9 expression in primary cortical astrocytes. Zymography and real-time PCR showed that lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) dramatically increased latent MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity and MMP-9 mRNA expression. By using the NO donor DETA NONOate, we observed a dose-dependent inhibition of MMP-9 induction by LPS. Active forms of MMP-9 were not found by zymography after NO treatment. The MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 completely inhibited LPS -induced MMP-9, which was partially inhibited by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. NO had no effect on LPS -stimulated ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK activation, suggesting that the inhibitory action of NO occurs downstream of MAPK cascades. Real-time PCR analysis showed that NO accelerated the degradation of MMP-9 mRNA after LPS induction. Western blotting and pull-down assay demonstrated that NO increased AUF-1 expression as well as its specific binding to the MMP-9 gene 3'-untranslated region.

The depressor mechanism of imidazoline-like drugs is believed to result from activation of I(1)-imidazoline receptors (I(1)R) and/or alpha(2)-adrenoceptors within the central nervous system, which are associated with the glutamatergic system. The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) has been recognized as a specific target area that mediates the depressor action of imidazoline-like drugs. The objective of this study was to determine the comparative effects of blockade of the central glutamate receptor subtypes N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) or alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA)/kainate on the cardiovascular actions of imidazoline-like drugs (clonidine and moxonidine ) in anaesthetized rats. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 or the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) produced similar reductions in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate ( HR ) to those induced by I.C.V. injection of clonidine. Intracerebroventricular injection of the glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenic acid not only abolished clonidine-induced hypotension and bradycardia but converted the responses to a pressor action and tachycardia. Unilateral injection of MK801 or CNQX into RVLM significantly attenuated intra-RVLM clonidine-induced decreases in BP and HR. We also found that unilateral injection of a selective I(1)R agonist, moxonidine, significantly decreased BP and HR, which were also attenuated to a similar extent by prior injection of MK801 or CNQX.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes chronic infection in more than 350 million people worldwide. It replicates in hepatocytes but is non-cytopathic; liver damage is thought to be immune mediated. Here, we investigated the role of innate immune responses in mediating liver damage in patients with chronic HBV infection. Longitudinal analysis revealed a temporal correlation between flares of liver inflammation and fluctuations in interleukin (IL)-8, interferon (IFN)-alpha, and natural killer (NK) cell expression of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) directly ex vivo. A cross-sectional study confirmed these findings in patients with HBV-related liver inflammation compared with healthy carriers. Activated, TRAIL -expressing NK cells were further enriched in the liver of patients with chronic HBV infection, while their hepatocytes expressed increased levels of a TRAIL death -inducing receptor. IFN-alpha concentrations found in patients were capable of activating NK cells to induce TRAIL -mediated hepatocyte apoptosis in vitro. The pathogenic potential of this pathway could be further enhanced by the ability of the IFN-alpha/IL-8 combination to dysregulate the balance of death -inducing and regulatory TRAIL receptors expressed on hepatocytes.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Ca rdiac T-type Ca (2+) channels are reexpressed in atrial and ventricular myocytes under various pathological conditions such as post-myocardial infarction, hypertrophy, and heart failure, but relatively little is known about the mechanisms. Our previous study found that bone morphogenetic protein-4 ( BMP4 ) was reexpressed in pathological cardiac hypertrophy models and BMP4 -mediated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We hypothesized that BMP4 could upregulate cardiac T-type Ca (2+) channels in HL-1 atrial myocytes. The T-type Ca (2+) currents were recorded by using the patch-clamp technique, and the expressions of Ca v3.1 and Ca v3.2 were measured by real-time PCR method in HL-1 cells. BMP4 and Ca v3.1 mRNA expressions increased in the left atrium from the pressure overload-induced hypertrophy of mice hearts. BMP4 treatment for 48 h induced increase of Ca v3.1 but not Ca v3.2 mRNA expression in HL-1 cells, and the increase was inhibited by BMP4 inhibitor noggin. Acute treatment with BMP4 did not affect T-type Ca (2+) currents, but chronic treatment (48 h) significantly increased the amplitude of T-type Ca (2+) currents in HL-1 cells. Chronic treatment with BMP4 induced upregulation of NADPH oxidase-4 (NOX4), increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activated protein kinases c-jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and p38.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) upon protein kinase C (PKC) delta and PKCepsilon gene expression was investigated in the gonadotroph-derived alphaT3-1 cell line. Stimulation of the cells with a stable analog [D-Trp6]GnRH ( GnRH-A ) resulted in a rapid elevation of PKCepsilon mRNA levels (1 h), while PKCdelta mRNA levels were elevated only after 24 h of incubation. The rapid elevation of PKCepsilon mRNA by GnRH-A was blocked by pretreatment with a GnRH antagonist or actinomycin D. The PKC activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), but not the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, mimicked the rapid effect of GnRH-A upon PKCepsilon mRNA elevation. Additionally, the rapid stimulatory effect of GnRH-A was blocked by the selective PKC inhibitor GF109203X, by TPA-mediated down-regulation of endogenous PKC, or by Ca2+ removal. Interestingly, serum-starvation (24 h) advanced the stimulation of PKCdelta mRNA levels by GnRH-A and the effect could be detected at 1 h of incubation. The rapid effect of GnRH-A upon PKCdelta mRNA levels in serum-starved cells was mimicked by TPA, but not by ionomycin, and was abolished by down-regulation of PKC or by Ca2+ removal.

Mucin hypersecretion is an important clinical feature of several respiratory diseases, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, nasal allergy, rhinitis, and sinusitis. It has been shown that -melanocyte-stimulating hormone ( -MSH ), a proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived peptide, has immunomodulatory activities by inhibiting NF-B activation induced by proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-.

Melanocortin-1-receptor (MC-1R) was detected by RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescent labeling in NHNE cells. -MSH suppressed NF-B/p65 phosphorylation induced by TNF- as well as IkB- degradation in a dose-dependent manner, as assessed by Western blotting. In addition, -MSH inhibited TNF--induced nuclear translocation of NF-B and NF-B luciferase activity. Real-time quantitative PCR data showed that -MSH inhibited TNF--induced expression of MUC5AC, and this effect of -MSH was neutralized by knockdown of MC-1R using MC-1R shRNA lentivirus. Analyses using RT-PCR and Western blotting showed the expression of POMC and two key enzymes in the POMC processing, proprotein convertases (PC)1 and PC2, and 7B2, which is required for enzymatic activity of PC2, in normal human nasal mucosa.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The present study evaluates the applicability of the zebrafish embryotoxicity test (ZET) to assess prenatal developmental toxicity ( PDT ) potency of the DMSO-extracts of 9 petroleum substances (PS), with variable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) content, and 2 gas-to-liquid (GTL) products, without any PAHs but otherwise similar properties to PS. The results showed that all PS extracts induced concentration-dependent in vitro PDT, as quantified in the ZET and that this potency is associated with their 3-5 ring PAH content. In contrast and as expected, GTL products did not induce any effect at all. The potencies obtained in the ZET correlated with those previously reported for the embryonic stem cell test (EST) (R2=0.61), while the correlation with potencies reported in in vivo studies were higher for the EST (R2=0.85) than the ZET (R2=0.69). Combining the results of the ZET with those previously reported for the EST (Kamelia et al., 2017), the aryl hydrocarbon (AhR) CALUX assay (Kamelia et al., 2018), and the PAH content, ranked and clustered the test compounds in line with their in vivo potencies and chemical characteristics.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulators in pathological processes, yet their potential roles in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are poorly understood. Here, we found that a novel lncRNA, LOC389641, was upregulated in PDAC tissues and cell lines. The expression of LOC389641 was significantly correlated with staging, lymph node metastasis and overall survival. Knockdown of LOC389641 impaired cell proliferation and invasion and induced cell apoptosis in vitro, whereas overexpression of LOC389641 had the opposite effect. The growth promoting effect of LOC389641 was also demonstrated in vivo. Further, a significant negative correlation was observed between E-cadherin levels and LOC389641 levels in vivo. Knockdown of LOC389641 upregulated E-cadherin expression, but knockdown of E-cadherin had a limited influence on LOC389641. Importantly, after E-cadherin was inhibited, the enhancement of LOC389641 on cell invasion was hindered. Moreover, the expression of LOC389641 was closely associated with its genomic neighboring gene TNFRSF10A. Lastly, knockdown experiments showed that TNFRSF10A might be a connection between LOC389641 and E-cadherin.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We investigated the role of beta2 ( CD18 ) and alpha4 (CD49d) integrins in eosinophil and neutrophil recruitment to lung parenchyma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of allergen-challenged Brown Norway (BN) rats. Challenge of sensitized BN rats with ovalbumin induced an eosinophil- and neutrophil-rich infiltrate in BALF at 24 h, accompanied by an increase in BALF protein content. Treatment with either the TA-2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) against alpha4 (as an F[ab']2 fragment) or the WT.3 mAb against beta2 integrin significantly reduced eosinophil and neutrophil accumulation in BALF by 54 to 66% and eosinophil accumulation in the parenchyma by 48%. A significant difference in effect was observed between mAb TA-2 in intact immunoglobulin G or F(ab)2 form. Combined treatment with mAbs WT.3 plus TA-2 (F[ab]2) virtually abolished eosinophil accumulation in BALF and in the parenchyma, and reduced neutrophil accumulation in BALF by 91%. In contrast, neutrophil accumulation in the lung was not inhibited by these mAb treatments. The increase in BALF protein concentration was significantly inhibited by TA-2 (by 40%) and by WT.3 plus TA-2 in combination (71% inhibition).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Surfactant-treated rabbits (n = 9) were ventilated with 100% oxygen for 36 hours and bovine surfactant was given via the trachea 12 hours after the start of mechanical ventilation. Saline-treated (n = 9) rabbits were treated identically, except that they received saline without surfactant. There were no significant changes in hemodynamics, lung mechanics, or arterial oxygen tension during artificial ventilation. Albumin concentration in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of saline-treated rabbits was slightly higher than those in surfactant -treated rabbits and significantly higher than in non-treated rabbits. C3a concentration in BALF was significantly higher in saline-treated rabbits than in surfactant -treated and non-treated rabbits. In addition, the wet-to-dry lung weight ratio was significantly lower in surfactant -treated rabbits than in saline-treated rabbits (5.06 +/- 0.10 vs. 5.67 +/- 0.14, P  0.05).

The mechanisms regulating proximal tubule ammonia metabolism are incompletely understood. The present study addressed the role of the proximal tubule basolateral electrogenic Na(+)-coupled bicarbonate cotransporter ( NBCe1 ; Slc4a4) in renal ammonia metabolism. We used mice with heterozygous and homozygous NBCe1 gene deletion and compared these mice with their wild-type littermates. Because homozygous NBCe1 gene deletion causes 100% mortality before day 25, we studied mice at day 8 (1 day). Both heterozygous and homozygous gene deletion caused a gene dose-related decrease in serum bicarbonate. The ability to lower urinary pH was intact, and even accentuated, with NBCe1 deletion. However, in contrast to the well-known effect of metabolic acidosis to increase urinary ammonia excretion, NBCe1 deletion caused a gene dose-related decrease in ammonia excretion. There was no identifiable change in proximal tubule structure by light microscopy. Examination of proteins involved in renal ammonia metabolism showed decreased expression of phosphate-dependent glutaminase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, key enzymes in proximal tubule ammonia generation, and increased expression of glutamine synthetase, which recycles intrarenal ammonia and regenerates glutamine. Expression of key proteins involved in ammonia transport outside of the proximal tubule (rhesus B glycoprotein and rhesus C glycoprotein) was not significantly changed by NBCe1 deletion.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Increased negativity of the interstitial fluid pressure (P(i)) in the skin is a major driving force to create the initial edema in burn injury and, to a smaller degree, in the edemas formed in the initial phase of the chemical irritation induced by xylene and the anaphylactic reaction induced by dextran. The phenomenon of increased negativity of P(i) is the basis for stating that the connective tissues become 'active' in fluid exchange since the increased negativity of P(i) will be a major driving pressure for transcapillary fluid flux under these circumstances. The present study was performed to investigate if increased negativity of P(i) contributes to formation of the inflammatory edema induced by carrageenan in the rat paw skin, since carrageenan inflammation involves mechanisms principally different from burn injury, xylene and dextran anaphylaxis. Control P(i) averaged -0.42 mmHg +/- 0.12 (SE). Injection of normal saline increased P(i) by 1.4 mmHg in 6-10 min. In animals with intact circulation P(i) decreased to -4.75 +/- 0.60 mmHg in the same time period following subdermal injection of carrageenan and later returned to control values by 21-30 min. To prevent the edema formation which will increase P(i) and potentially lead to underestimation of an increased negativity in P(i), measurements were also performed after circulatory arrest when there will be no transcapillary fluid flux in response to the inflammatory agent. In this group P(i) fell to -4.10 +/- 0.71 mmHg (11-20 min) and remained at -2.75 to -4.10 mmHg throughout the observation period. Premedication with aprotinin (protease inhibitor), indomethacin (prostaglandin inhibitor) and 1,2 benzopyrone did not change the increased negativity in P(i) induced by carrageenan.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The flexible heteroarotinoids (Flex-Het) represent a novel type of atypical retinoids lacking activity in binding to and transactivating retinoid receptors. Preclinical studies have shown that Flex-Hets induce apoptosis of cancer cells while sparing normal cells and exhibit anticancer activity in vivo with improved therapeutic ratios over conventional retinoid receptor agonists. Flex-Hets have been shown to induce apoptosis through activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. The present study has revealed a novel mechanism underlying Flex-Het-induced apoptosis involving induction of death receptor 5 (DR5). The representative Flex-Het SHetA2 effectively inhibited the growth of human lung cancer cells in cell culture and in mice. SHetA2 induced apoptosis, which could be abrogated by silencing caspase-8 expression, indicating that ShetA2 triggers a caspase-8-dependent apoptosis. Accordingly, SHetA2 up-regulated DR5 expression, including cell surface levels of DR5, and augmented tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis -inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis. Importantly, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated blockade of DR5 induction conferred cell resistance to SHetA2 -induced apoptosis, as well as SHetA2 /TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These results show that DR5 induction is a key component of apoptosis induced by SHetA2 or by SHetA2 combined with TRAIL. SHetA2 exerted CAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP)-dependent transactivation of the DR5 promoter.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The cDNA clone (Pg8) corresponding to the 3'-end of fatty acid synthetase ( FAS ) mRNA is one of the few probes to study in cell lines the mechanism by which an endogenous gene is regulated by progestin s. The steady-state level of FAS mRNA is known to be increased by the synthetic progestin R5020 in the human breast cancer cell line MCF7. We show here that it is also increased in another progesterone-receptor-positive cell line T47D but not in progesterone-receptor-negative cell lines BT20, MDA-MB231, and HBL100. In R5020-treated MCF7 cells, the FAS mRNA concentration increased with cell density. Protein synthesis inhibitors did not abolish progestin induction of FAS suggesting a primary effect of the hormone. In vitro nuclear run-on transcription assays showed that the FAS gene transcription rate was increased about 4-fold by progestin. This stimulation of transcription was detectable 30 min after addition of R5020 and was maximal after 4 h, but could not totally account for the total increase in the mRNA steady state level.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We have investigated the transport characteristics of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate ( DHEAS ), a neuroactive steroid, at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in a series of functional in vivo and in vitro studies. The apparent BBB efflux rate constant of [(3)H] DHEAS evaluated by the brain efflux index method was 2.68 x 10(-2) min(-1). DHEAS efflux transport was a saturable process with a Michaelis constant (K:(m)) of 32.6 microM: Significant amounts of [(3)H] DHEAS were determined in the jugular venous plasma by HPLC, providing direct evidence that most of the DHEAS is transported in intact form from brain to the circulating blood across the BBB. This efflux transport of [(3)H] DHEAS was significantly inhibited by common rat organic anion-transporting polypeptide (oatp) substrates such as taurocholate, cholate, sulfobromophthalein, and estrone-3-sulfate. Moreover, the apparent efflux clearance of [(3)H] DHEAS across the BBB (118 microl/min-g of brain) was 10.4-fold greater than its influx clearance estimated by the in situ brain perfusion technique (11.4 microl/min-g of brain), suggesting that DHEAS is predominantly transported from the brain to blood across the BBB. In cellular uptake studies using a conditionally immortalized mouse brain capillary endothelial cell line (TM-BBB4), [(3)H] DHEAS uptake by TM-BBB4 cells exhibited a concentration dependence with a K:(m) of 34.4 microM: and was significantly inhibited by the oatp2 -specific substrate digoxin.

Doxorubicin (DOX) is widely used as an anti-cancer agent although it causes irreversible cardiomyopathy by increasing oxidative stress and deregulating nitric oxide production. Beraprost (BPS), a stable prostacyclin ( PGI2 ) analog, is a potent vasodilator that has beneficial effects on myocardial ischemia. The objectives of the present study were to delineate the uncertain effects of prostcyclin therapy on DOX induced cardiomyopathy and to explore the mechanisms underlying PGI2 and DOX interaction. For this reason, we stimulated endogenous PGI2 production using bicistronic COX-1/PGIS gene transfer and BPS supplementation, and investigated the effects on DOX-induced cardiomyopathy. Caspase-dependent protein content, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), DNA fragmentation, and TUNEL positive cells were elevated in DOX-treated cardiomyocytes. These indicators were further elevated by adenovirus-COX- 1/PGIS transfection or BPS supplementation. In addition, PGI2 overexpression further increased iNOS expression and superoxide accumulation in cardiomyocytes compared with DOX alone, which may be the reason for aggravated cytotoxicity. Moreover, BPS can induce cAMP response elements (CRE) binding to the iNOS promoter and phospho- cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) expression in a cyclic AMP-dependent manner. Our in vivo studies show that MnTBAP and aminoguanidine treatment of DOX and BPS co-administered in mice can attenuate caspase-3 and PARP-1 protein expression, and improve mouse survival, as observed in the iNOS gene-deleted mice.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Using a polymerase chain reaction approach, we have studied the expression of somatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtypes in the GH3 rat pituitary cell line, a well established in vitro model for the cellular effects of somatostatin. We found that the previously identified SSTR1 and SSTR2 are the major subtypes expressed in this cell line. No other SSTR subtype was detected by our analysis. Northern blots confirmed that both subtypes, but not SSTR3, are expressed in GH3 cells. We studied the functional expression of both SSTR subtypes by transfection of their cDNAs into human embryonic kidney 293 cells. We found that somatostatin inhibited cAMP accumulation in human embryonic kidney 293 cells only when cells were transfected with either SSTR1 or SSTR2. This inhibition was blocked by treatment of the transfected cells with pertussis toxin, demonstrating that it is mediated by G proteins sensitive to this toxin. In addition, we provide pharmacological evidence that the endogenous SSTR2 subtype mediates inhibition of cAMP accumulation in intact GH3 cells.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the putative role of endothelin (ET) in mediating ischemia /hypoxia-induced ANP release utilizing exogenous ET-1 or ET receptor antagonists (BQ-123 or Bosentan). Isolated rat hearts with non-distended atria were perfused using a Langendorff apparatus and heart rate maintained constant via atrial pacing. Global ischemia was induced either by direct reduction in perfusion or by infusion of exogenous ET-1 (5 x 10(-10) M) for 30 minutes. Perfusion with the ET receptor antagonists, BQ-123 (10(-6) M) or Bosentan (10(-5) M) was initiated 10 minutes before onset of ischemia. Moderate or severe ischemia was induced by reduction (52-61% and 70-82%, respectively) in perfusate flow. Thirty minutes of ischemia /hypoxia (5% O2) was followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion/re-oxygenation. Both moderate and severe ischemia increased ANP release. BQ-123 and Bosentan did not affect basal or ischemia -induced ANP release. Exogenous ET-1 perfusion induced a late increase in ANP release (P  0.01) that did not exceed the increase in ANP release associated with equivalent direct flow reduction. Hypoxia induced an 8-fold increase in ANP release rate. The ANP release rate returned toward basal levels after re-oxygenation.

In an uncontrolled, open study, we administered sequentially different doses of dopamine (0, 2, 4, 8 and 0 microgram kg-1 min-1) during a 1-h period each. Systemic haemodynamic and renal haemodynamic variables were measured simultaneously using a pulmonary artery catheter and radiopharmaceuticals, respectively.

All patients received extradural analgesia with bupivacaine and sufentanil, and none had a previous history of heart failure. Dopamine induced a dose-dependent increase in cardiac index which returned to baseline after cessation of the dopamine infusion.

Malonyl-CoA significantly increased the Km for L-carnitine of overt carnitine palmitoyltransferase in liver mitochondria from fed rats. This effect was observed when the molar palmitoyl-CoA/albumin concentration ratio was low (0.125-1.0), but not when it was higher (2.0). In the absence of malonyl-CoA, the Km for L-carnitine increased with increasing palmitoyl-CoA/albumin ratios. Malonyl-CoA did not increase the Km for L-carnitine in liver mitochondria from 24h-starved rats or in heart mitochondria from fed animals. The Km for L-carnitine of the latent form of carnitine palmitoyltransferase was 3-4 times that for the overt form of the enzyme. At low ratios of palmitoyl-CoA/albumin (0.5), the concentration of malonyl-CoA causing a 50% inhibition of overt carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity was decreased by 30% when assays with liver mitochondria from fed rats were performed at 100 microM-instead of 400 microM-carnitine. Such a decrease was not observed with liver mitochondria from starved animals. L-Carnitine displaced [14C] malonyl-CoA from liver mitochondrial binding sites. D-Carnitine was without effect.

Estradiol-17 beta ( E2 ) produces vasodilation in several systemic vascular beds, but most extensively in the nonpregnant uterus. It has been postulated that E2 induces this vasodilation via blockade of vascular alpha-adrenergic receptors. This hypothesis was tested in six chronically instrumented, nonpregnant sheep by comparing the systemic and uterine hemodynamic responses to intravenous E2, to an alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker, phentolamine, and to both agents given together. Uterine blood flow (UBF) increased significantly after E2 administration, from 20 +/- 7 to 233 +/- 37 (SE) ml/min. In contrast, phentolamine had no detectable effect on UBF or on the UBF response to E2 when both were given together. Similar contrasting responses were observed in the effects of E2 and/or phentolamine on the systemic vasculature. When responses to alpha-agonists were evaluated, there was no evidence of alpha-blockade following E2 despite the substantial vasodilation ; in contrast, alpha-blockade was present during phentolamine administration when no vasodilation was noted.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Metformin, an inexpensive, well-tolerated oral agent that is a commonly used first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, has become the focus of intense research as a potential anticancer agent. In this study, we describe the inhibitory effect of metformin in interleukin 8 (IL-8) upregulation by lithocholic acid (LCA) in HCT116 colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Pharmacological inhibition studies indicated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) were involved in LCA-induced IL-8 upregulation through activation of the transcription factor NF-B. Metformin was demonstrated to block LCA-stimulated ROS production, in turn suppressing NF-B signaling that was critical for IL-8 upregulation. An NADPH oxidase assay proved that the inhibitory effect of metformin on ROS production was derived from its strong suppression of NADPH oxidase, a key producer of ROS in cells. Compared with conditioned media (CM) derived from HCT116 cells treated with LCA, CM derived from HCT116 cells pretreated with metformin and then treated with LCA lost all stimulatory effect on endothelial cell proliferation and tubelike formation.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Diabetes complications are caused by hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia results in increased concentrations of glucose degradation products. The study of peritoneal dialysis solution biocompatibility has highlighted the adverse effects of glucose degradation products. Recently, 3,4-dideoxyglucosone-3-ene ( 3,4-DGE ) has been identified as the most toxic glucose degradation product in peritoneal dialysis fluids. Its role in renal pathophysiology has not been addressed. 3,4-DGE induces apoptosis in murine renal tubular epithelial cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Peak apoptosis is observed after 72 h of culture. The lethal concentration range is 25-50 micromol/l. 3,4-DGE results in Bax oligomerization, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, activation of caspases-9 and -3, and Bid proteolysis. Apoptosis induced by 3,4-DGE is caspase dependent and could be prevented by the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (Z-Val-Ala-DL-Asp-fluoromethylketone) and by specific inhibitors of caspases-2, -8, and -9. However, caspase inhibition did not prevent eventual cell death. In contrast, antagonism of Bax by a Ku-70-derived peptide or antisense oligonucleotides prevented both apoptosis and cell death.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Pyruvate given in large doses may be neuroprotective in stroke, but it is not known to what degree the brain metabolizes pyruvate. Intravenous injection of [3-13C] pyruvate led to dose-dependent labelling of cerebral metabolites so that at 5 min after injection of 18 mmoles [3-13C] pyruvate /kg (2 g sodium pyruvate /kg), approximately 20% of brain glutamate and GABA were labelled, as could be detected by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry ex vivo. Pyruvate, 9 mmoles/kg, was equivalent to glucose, 9 mmoles/kg, as a substrate for cerebral tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity. Inhibition of the glial TCA cycle with fluoroacetate did not affect formation of [4-13C]glutamate or [2-13C]GABA from [3-13C] pyruvate, but reduced formation of [4-13C]glutamine by 50%, indicating predominantly neuronal metabolism of exogenous pyruvate. Extensive formation of [3-13C]lactate from [2-13C] pyruvate demonstrated reversible carboxylation of pyruvate to malate and equilibration with fumarate, presumably in neurones, but anaplerotic formation of TCA cycle intermediates from exogenous pyruvate could not be detected.

Metformin is an antidiabetic drug with anticancer properties, which mainly acts through induction of AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ). In the present study we investigated the influence of metformin on the in vitro anticancer activity of the well-known chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin. Cell viability was determined by MTT and LDH release assay, oxidative stress and apoptosis (caspase activation, DNA fragmentation, and phosphatidylserine exposure) were assessed by flow cytometry, while activation of AMPK and Akt was analyzed by immunoblotting. Although metformin reduced the number of tumour cells when applied alone, it surprisingly antagonized the cytotoxicity of cisplatin towards U251 human glioma, C6 rat glioma, SHSY5Y human neuroblastoma, L929 mouse fibrosarcoma and HL-60 human leukemia cell lines. Only in B16 mouse melanoma cells metformin augmented the cytotoxicity of cisplatin. In U251 glioma cells metformin suppressed cisplatin-induced apoptotic cell death through inhibition of oxidative stress and caspase activation. The observed cytoprotection was apparently AMPK -independent, as metformin did not further increase cisplatin-induced AMPK activation in U251 cells and other pharmacological AMPK activators failed to block cisplatin-mediated apoptosis. On the other hand, metformin induced Akt activation in cisplatin-treated cells and Akt inhibitor 10-DEBC hydrochloride or phosphoinositide 3-kinase/ Akt inhibitor LY294002 abolished metformin-mediated antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

It was the objective of this study to examine the role of human neutrophil granulocytes (PMN) in an in-vitro model of human neo-intima developed for the study of atherosclerosis. Human granulocytes were subjected to a co-culture model of human endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Subendothelial lipid accumulation was achieved by addition of native LDL to the culture medium. Tissue samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and scanning/transmission electron microscopy, and culture supernatants were examined for the presence of interleukin-8 (IL-8), MCP-1, GRO-alpha, elastase and matrixmetalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8). Following addition of 2 mg/ml LDL, adherence, transmigration and infiltration depth of PMN was increased significantly when compared to controls. LDL challenging was paralleled by a time- and dose-dependent secretion of IL-8 from intimal smooth muscle cells.

We tested the hypothesis that myocardial contractile protein phosphorylation and the Ca(2+) sensitivity of force production are dysregulated in a porcine model of pacing-induced heart failure ( HF ). The level of protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent cardiac troponin I ( TnI ) phosphorylation was lower in the myocardium surrounding the pacing electrode (pacing site) of the failing left ventricle (LV) than in the controls. Immunohistochemical assays of the LV pacing site pointed to isolated clusters of cardiomyocytes exhibiting a reduced level of phosphorylated TnI. Flow cytometry on isolated and permeabilized cardiomyocytes revealed a significantly larger cell-to-cell variation in the level of TnI phosphorylation of the LV pacing site than in the opposite region in HF or in either region in the controls: the interquartile range (IQR) on the distribution histogram of relative TnI phosphorylation was wider at the pacing site (IQR = 0.53) than that at the remote site of HF (IQR = 0.42; P = 0.0047) or that of the free wall of the control animals (IQR = 0.36; P = 0.0093).

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), characterized by excessive inflammation and lipid deposition, is one of the most common metabolic liver diseases. The expression of NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages is significantly increased in NAFLD, and its activation aggravates NAFLD greatly. Tim-4, as the phosphatidylserine (PS) receptor, is expressed highly in macrophages, and macrophage Tim-4 inhibits inflammation under various conditions of immune activation. However, the precise role of Tim-4 in NLRP3 inflammasome regulation and NAFLD pathogenesis remains completely unknown. Using NAFLD mice models, we confirmed that the expression of Tim-4 was increased in liver tissues by Western blot, real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence, especially higher expression in liver macrophages, and Tim-4 knockout mice displayed more severe liver inflammation and hepatic steatosis than controls in NAFLD mice model. In vitro, we found that Tim-4 could inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and the inhibition was dependent on PS binding domain in the IgV domain. Mechanistically, Tim-4 induced the degradation of NLRP3 inflammasome components through activating AMPK-mediated autophagy. Specifically, Tim-4 promoted AMPK phosphorylation by interacting with LKB1 and AMPK. In addition, PS binding motif was responsible for Tim-4 -mediated AMPK and LKB1 interaction.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

1. Experiments were carried out to test whether neosurugatoxin ( NSTX ) which blocks autonomic ganglia also acts centrally, like hexamethonium, on nicotinic cholinoceptors involved in the neural control of release of vasopressin and oxytocin from the neurohypophysis. 2. In the water-loaded rat under ethanol anaesthesia, nicotine 100 micrograms i.v. produced a pressor and an antidiuretic response accompanied by an increase in the urinary excretion of vasopressin and of oxytocin-like radioimmunoreactivity (OLRI). This indicates release of both vasopressin and oxytocin. 3. Under conditions in which tachyphylaxis was avoided, NSTX, 80 ng i.c.v., caused a prolonged inhibition of the release of both hormones by nicotine. 4. NSTX i.c.v. caused some reduction in the pressor response to nicotine.

Antinociceptive actions and effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) dynorphin-(1-13) (DYN) on morphine (MOR) analgesia and acute tolerance were studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Antinociceptive effect against hind paw pressure was produced by 30 micrograms of DYN, but not by 0.5-10 micrograms. Acetic acid writhing was inhibited dose-dependently by DYN at the doses of 2-30 micrograms, and the order of potency of the anti-writhing effect was beta-endorphin > MOR > DYN >> Met-enkephalin. The anti-writhing effect of DYN that was partially antagonized by naloxone at 10 mg/kg, s.c. in MOR tolerant rats was the same as that in MOR naive rats. The anti-writhing effect of i.c.v.-MOR was increased synergistically by DYN. Continuous s.c. (6 mg/kg/hr) and i.c.v. (7.5 micrograms/rat/hr) infusion of MOR produced antinociception against hind paw pressure, which reached maximum (MAX) and attenuated thereafter during MOR infusion for 6 hr. The attenuation of antinociception was also produced during MOR infusion combined with multiple i.c.v.-injection of DYN. The MAX and area under the antinociceptive curve during MOR infusion was not affected by multiple injection of DYN, i.e., no effect of i.c.v.-DYN on the development of acute MOR tolerance induced by s.c.- and i.c.v.-infusion was observed.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We have recently reported that the inhibition of endothelial cell COX-2 by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs suppresses alpha(V)beta(3)- (but not alpha(5)beta(1)-) dependent Rac activation, endothelial cell spreading, migration, and angiogenesis (Dormond, O., Foletti, A., Paroz, C., and Ruegg, C. (2001) Nat. Med. 7, 1041-1047). Here we investigated the role of the COX-2 metabolites PGE(2) and TXA2 in regulating human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) adhesion and spreading. We report that PGE(2) accelerated alpha(V)beta(3)-mediated HUVEC adhesion and promoted Rac activation and cell spreading, whereas the TXA2 agonist retarded adhesion and inhibited spreading. We show that the cAMP level and the cAMP-regulated protein kinase A (PKA) activity are critical mediators of these PGE(2) effects. alpha(V)beta(3)-mediated adhesion induced a transient COX-2 -dependent rise in cAMP levels, whereas the cell-permeable cAMP analogue 8-brcAMP accelerated adhesion, promoted Rac activation, and cell spreading in the presence of the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398. Pharmacological inhibition of PKA completely blocked alpha(V)beta(3)-mediated adhesion. A constitutively active Rac mutant (L61Rac) rescued alpha(V)beta(3)-dependent spreading in the presence of NS398 or, but did not accelerate adhesion, whereas a dominant negative Rac mutant (N17Rac) suppressed spreading without affecting adhesion. alpha(5)beta(1)-mediated HUVEC adhesion, Rac activation, and spreading were not affected by PGE(2), 8-brcAMP, or the inhibition of PKA.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Angiotensin II ( AngII ) has been strongly implicated in hypertension and its complications. Evidence suggests the mechanisms by which AngII elevates blood pressure and enhances cardiovascular remodeling and damage may be distinct. However, the signal transduction cascade by which AngII specifically initiates cardiovascular remodeling, such as hypertrophy and fibrosis, remains insufficiently understood. In vascular smooth muscle cells, a metalloproteinase ADAM17 mediates epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation, which may be responsible for cardiovascular remodeling but not hypertension induced by AngII. Thus, the objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that activation of vascular ADAM17 is indispensable for vascular remodeling but not for hypertension induced by AngII. Vascular ADAM17 -deficient mice and control mice were infused with AngII for 2 weeks. Control mice infused with AngII showed cardiac hypertrophy, vascular medial hypertrophy, and perivascular fibrosis. These phenotypes were prevented in vascular ADAM17 -deficient mice independent of blood pressure alteration. AngII infusion enhanced ADAM17 expression, epidermal growth factor receptor activation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress in the vasculature, which were diminished in ADAM17 -deficient mice. Treatment with a human cross-reactive ADAM17 inhibitory antibody also prevented cardiovascular remodeling and endoplasmic reticulum stress but not hypertension in C57Bl/6 mice infused with AngII.

This study in human liver microsomes was undertaken to establish whether paroxetine stereoselectively inhibits the oxidative metabolism of metoprolol in vitro, and whether the in vivo observed magnitude of the paroxetine - metoprolol interaction was predictable from these in vitro data. Two distinct approaches were used: inhibitory effect of paroxetine on 1) the formation of alpha-hydroxymetoprolol and O-desmethylmetoprolol from the individual metoprolol enantiomers and 2) on the depletion of the enantiomers from the incubation mixture. Nonspecific binding of both metoprolol and paroxetine to human liver microsomes was also investigated. Whereas metoprolol displayed negligible binding, paroxetine was extensively bound to microsomal proteins. This was taken into account in order to obtain unbiased K(i) values and unbound concentrations of paroxetine. In the substrate depletion experiments, the intrinsic clearance (CL(int)) of (R)- metoprolol was larger than that of (S)- metoprolol. Paroxetine caused a concentration-dependent decrease in CL(int) of both enantiomers and abolished the stereoselectivity. In the metabolite formation experiments paroxetine did not stereoselectively affect alpha-hydroxylation, but preferentially inhibited the O-demethylation of the (R)-enantiomer versus the (S)-enantiomer. The use of unbound paroxetine concentrations in the two in vitro methods yielded comparable predicted increases in area under the curve (1.7-1.9 and 2.2-2.5 for (S)- and (R)- metoprolol, respectively) but underestimated the in vivo observed changes of about 7- and 10-fold, respectively.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Periodontal (gum) disease is one of the main global oral health burdens and severe periodontal disease (periodontitis) is a leading cause of tooth loss in adults globally. It also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) is a key virulent attribute that significantly contributes to periodontal pathogenesis. Baicalin is a flavonoid from Scutellaria radix, an herb commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine for treating inflammatory diseases. The present study examined the modulatory effect of baicalin on P. gingivalis LPS -induced expression of IL-6 and IL-8 in human oral keratinocytes (HOKs). Cells were pre-treated with baicalin (0-80 M) for 24 h, and subsequently treated with P. gingivalis LPS at 10 g/ml with or without baicalin for 3 h. IL-6 and IL-8 transcripts and proteins were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. The expression of nuclear factor-B (NF-B), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) proteins was analyzed by western blot. A panel of genes related to toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling was examined by PCR array. We found that baicalin significantly downregulated P. gingivalis LPS -stimulated expression of IL-6 and IL-8, and inhibited P. gingivalis LPS -activated NF-B, p38 MAPK and JNK.

Gastrointestinal motor abnormalities may account for dyspeptic symptoms of chronic uremia patients. However, the data on gastric emptying are conflicting in human studies. We, therefore, assessed gastric emptying and gastrointestinal transit in a rat uremia model. Chronic uremia was induced by five-sixths nephrectomy in the rats. After 20-hour fasting, the rats were loaded with 70 glass beads as solid markers through a gastric catheter. Two hours later, the stomach was exposed and the small intestine was equally divided into 10 segments. The glass beads in the stomach and in each intestinal segment were counted. The gastric emptying was expressed as the ratio of the number of glass beads in the small intestine to that counted from the entire gastrointestinal tract. The intestinal transit was assessed by analyzing the geometric center of the distribution of glass beads in the intestinal segments. Two conventional nonabsorbable markers, radioactive chromate and charcoal, were also used to evaluate gastric emptying and intestinal transit in the fasted state. Additionally, similar experiments of glass beads were performed in the fed state.

Steroidogenic acute regulatory ( StAR ) protein plays a critical role in steroid hormone synthesis. Tropic hormones induce human StAR gene expression by a cAMP -dependent pathway. Steroidogenic factor-1/adrenal-4-binding protein (SF-1/Ad4BP) plays an important role in the expression of human StAR gene. We investigated the mechanism of cAMP responsiveness in human StAR gene expression in NCI-H295R cells. The StAR promoter activity and protein levels in cells subjected to various treatments were examined. Anti-SF-1/Ad4BP IgG transfection treatment resulted in decreases in the basal StAR promoter activity and StAR protein levels, but did not affect cAMP -stimulated promoter activity and protein levels. The basal and cAMP -stimulated StAR promoter activity levels were reduced in SF-1/Ad4BP mutant (G35E)-transfected cells, but the cAMP induction of StAR promoter activity in response to 1 mM 8-Br- cAMP was not inhibited when G35E SF-1/Ad4BP mutant expression vectors were co-transfected with cAMP -response element-binding (CREB) expression vectors. Although the basal StAR mRNA expression and protein levels were decreased by SF-1/Ad4BP-siRNA treatment, the cAMP -stimulated StAR mRNA expression and protein levels did not change. The basal StAR promoter activity level was not decreased by cAMP -response element modulator (CREM)-siRNA treatment, but the cAMP -stimulated StAR promoter activity level, the magnitude of cAMP induction of StAR promoter, and the cAMP -stimulated StAR protein level were decreased.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Lipid abnormalities and activation of the local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic glomerular disease. This study investigated whether low-density lipoprotein (LDL) activates local RAS in cultured human mesangial cells (HMC) and, at the same time, whether ANG II mediates LDL-induced mesangial cell proliferation, hypertrophy, and superoxide (O2-) generation. Quiescent HMC were exposed to 50 to 200 microg/ml of LDL or 10-7 to 10-10 M ANG II for 0.5 to 24 h in the presence or absence of 10-6 M losartan, an ANG II type I (AT1) receptor antagonist, or 10-5 M diphehylendieodonium (DPI) or 10-4 M apocynin, inhibitors of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase. LDL induced an up to threefold increase in the ANG II levels in the culture medium of HMC. LDL upregulated AT1 receptor and angiotensinogen mRNA expression in HMC. LDL incubated with HMC increased O2- production by up to 3.3 times compared with the level of control cells. The LDL-induced, increased O2- generation was suppressed by losartan, DPI, or apocynin. LDL significantly increased mesangial [3H]thymidine or [3H]leucine incorporation, whereas these processes were abrogated by losartan.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

COX-2 overexpression is recognized in various cancers, but the role of COX-2 in the progression of cancer, including the liver metastasis of colon cancer, is not clearly understood. We examined the role of COX-2 in the mechanism of liver metastasis of colon cancer, using a highly metastasizable colon carcinoma cell line, LM-H3. A COX-2 inhibitor, JTE-522, inhibited cell proliferation and invasion of LM-H3 in vitro and clearly reduced the number of metastatic nodules on the surface of nude mouse livers in vivo. We also examined the effects of JTE-522 on the production of growth factors and MMPs through the use of ELISA and gelatin zymography, respectively. JTE-522 downregulated PDGF production by LM-H3 but had no influence on VEGF production. JTE-522 also inhibited MMP-2 secretion by LM-H3.

The objective of the study was to investigate whether different initial baseline cholesterol levels modulate the efficacy of a spread enriched with plant sterol-esters ( PS ) in lowering blood cholesterol in a Japanese population consuming their usual diet. Healthy adults with a mean age of 45 y and mean plasma total cholesterol (TC) level of 6.5 mmol/L were recruited to participate in a double-blind trial comprised of a run-in period of 1 wk, followed by two intervention periods of 3 wks in a 2 x 2 crossover design and a post-trial follow-up of 3 wk. Volunteers consumed two spreads, one enriched with PS (12 g/100 g plant sterols) and a control spread not fortified with PS. Recommended spread intake was 15 g/d. Effects on plasma lipids, lipoproteins, beta-carotene and vitamins A and E were assessed. Plasma TC and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations were 5.8 and 9.1% lower, respectively, when subjects consumed the PS spread than when they consumed the control spread (P  0.001). Subjects were divided into two groups [normal and mildly cholesterolemic (TC 5.7 mmol/L) and hypercholesterolemic (TC >/= 5.7 mmol/L)]. Reductions (P  0.001) in TC and LDL-C due to treatment in the former group were 4.9 and 7.9%, respectively. In the hypercholesterolemic group, the reductions (P  0.001) were 7.1 and 10.6%, respectively. The decreases did not differ between normal/mildly cholesterolemic and hypercholesterolemic subjects. Plasma apolipoprotein B (apoB) and remnant-like particle (RLP) cholesterol ( RLP-C ) concentrations were lower when subjects consumed the PS spread (44.3 g/L) than the control spread (49.7 g/L). Plasma beta-carotene concentration was lower (P  0.001) in subjects consuming the PS spread than in the control.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

In a separate study, we identified PGE2 as a potent inhibitor of TGF-beta1induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cultured Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (Zhang A, Wang M-H, Dong Z, and Yang T. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 291: F1323-F1331, 2006). This finding prompted us to examine the roles of other prostanoids: PGD2, PGF(2alpha), PGI2, and thromboxane A2 (TXA2). Treatment with 10 ng/ml TGF-beta1 for 3 days induced EMT as reflected by conversion to the spindle-like morphology, loss of E-cadherin, and activation of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA). Treatment with PGD2 remarkably preserved the epithelial-like morphology, restored the expression of E-cadherin, and abolished the activation of alpha-SMA. In contrast, PGF(2alpha), carbocyclic thromboxane A2, PGI2 and its stable analog beraprost were without an effect. MDCK cells expressed DP1 and DP2 receptors; however, the effect of PGD2 was neither prevented by DP1 antagonist BW-A868C or DP2 antagonist BAY-u3405 nor was mimicked by DP1 agonist BW-245C. cAMP-elevating agents forskolin and 8-Br-cAMP blocked EMT. However, cAMP blockers H89 and Rp-cAMP failed to block the effect of PGD2. PGD2 did not seem to act via its metabolites as 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) levels in the medium following incubation with 3 microM PGD2 were well below the values predicted from the cross activity of the assay.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Adrenomedullin is a potent hypotensive peptide that may act on myocytes to inhibit hypertrophy and on fibroblasts to inhibit growth in vitro induced by mechanical stretching and angiotensin II. Adrenomedullin is processed from the inactive intermediate adrenomedullin precursor with a glycine extension, which is subsequently converted to biologically active mature adrenomedullin by enzymatic amidation. Total adrenomedullin is the sum of intermediate and mature adrenomedullin. We examined the effect of a subpressor dose of angiotensin II on the production of left ventricular adrenomedullin and on protein levels of mature adrenomedullin in the left ventricle in vivo. We also investigated whether the effect is mediated by the angiotensin II type 1 receptor. Concentrations of total and mature adrenomedullin in the left ventricle and mature adrenomedullin -to-intermediate adrenomedullin ratio were significantly increased by angiotensin II infusion, regardless of pressure overload. Total and mature adrenomedullin concentrations significantly correlated with the weight of the left ventricle.

Activation of C-C chemokine receptor type 7 ( CCR7 ) has been demonstrated to mediate the occurrence and progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the potential therapeutic role of CCR7 inhibition in NSCLC is still obscure. Thus, the present study was conducted to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibition of CCR7 on cell apoptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in NSCLC A549 cells. Chemokine ligand 21 (CCL21) was used to activate CCR7 and the results revealed that CCR7 upregulation inhibited cell apoptosis and affected apoptosisrelated protein levels. However, CCR7 -siRNA treatment markedly promoted apoptosis and suppressed inflammatory response and transforming growth factor 1 ( TGF- 1)-induced EMT. In addition, CCR7 siRNA inactivated the NF-B signaling pathway and inhibition of NF-B via its specific antagonist, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, indicated that NF-B was involved in the CCR7 -mediated apoptosis.

The potential role of nitric oxide synthase-2 (NOS2) in acute lung injury (ALI) has gained increasing attention. This study evaluates the effects of hypoxia, an important feature of ALI, on NOS2 expression in a rat model of ALI caused by exposure to hypoxia and LPS. Exposure to hypoxia alone had no effect on the expression of NOS2 in rat lungs. LPS treatment resulted in a significant increase in NOS2 in the lungs, which was further enhanced by concomitant exposure to hypoxia. Immunohistochemical analysis and in situ hybridization showed no changes in the expression of NOS2 in lung resident cells under any conditions. The increase in NOS2 levels is mainly due to the influx of NOS2-expressing inflammatory cells. By morphologic analysis, these inflammatory cells were identified as neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. In vitro experiments of lung epithelial and endothelial cell lines showed no detectable expression of NOS2 with any of the treatments. In a macrophage cell line, LPS -induced NOS2 expression was not affected by the concomitant exposure to hypoxia.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The multiple kinase inhibitor dovitinib is currently under clinical investigation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we investigated the mechanistic basis for the effects of dovitinib in HCCs. Dovitinib showed significant antitumor activity in HCC cell lines PLC5, Hep3B, Sk-Hep1, and Huh-7. Dovitinib downregulated phospho-STAT3 (p-STAT3) at tyrosine 705 and subsequently reduced the levels of expression of STAT3-related proteins Mcl-1, survivin, and cyclin D1 in a time-dependent manner. Ectopic expression of STAT3 abolished the apoptotic effect of dovitinib, indicating that STAT3 is indispensable in mediating the effect of dovitinib in HCC. SHP-1 inhibitor reversed downregulation of p-STAT3 and apoptosis induced by dovitinib, and silencing of SHP-1 by RNA interference abolished the effects of dovitinib on p-STAT3, indicating that SHP-1, a protein tyrosine phosphatase, mediates the effects of dovitinib. Notably, dovitinib increased SHP-1 activity in HCC cells. Incubation of dovitinib with pure SHP-1 protein enhanced its phosphatase activity, indicating that dovitinib upregulates the activity of SHP-1 via direct interactions. In addition, dovitinib induced apoptosis in two sorafenib-resistant cell lines through inhibition of STAT3, and sorafenib-resistant cells showed significant activation of STAT3, suggesting that targeting STAT3 may be a useful approach to overcome drug resistance in HCC.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Short-term stimulation of beta-receptors is known to affect cardiac ion channels; however, the impact of longer-term stimulation on intrinsic channel function is poorly understood. To evaluate this, cultured guinea pig ventricular myocytes were exposed to isoproterenol (10 nM), vehicle, or isoproterenol plus propranolol (1 microM) for 48 h. Sustained exposure to isoproterenol decreased the density of the inward rectifier (I(K1)), slow delayed rectifier (I(Ks)), and L-type Ca2+ (I( Ca L )) currents, effects that were fully prevented by propranolol. Changes in K+ currents were prevented by the beta1-selective antagonist CGP-20712A, unaffected by the beta2-antagonist ICI-118,551, and mimicked by the membrane-permeable cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP.

Cytokines may contribute to beta-cell apoptosis in the early stages of type 1 diabetes mellitus. It has been reported recently that interleukin-1 beta ( IL-1 beta ) induces activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) p38 and ERK1/2 in neonatal rat islets. Since these kinases may participate in cytokine-induced apoptosis, we evaluated whether cytokines induce activation of MAPKs in FACS-purified primary rat beta-cells, and whether blockers of p38 and/or ERK1/2 prevent beta-cell death. IL-1 beta, but not interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), caused phosphorylation of the substrates Elk-1, ATF-2 and hsp25, and the phosphorylation of both Elk-1 and hsp25 were decreased by the p38 blocker SB203580 (p38i) and the MAPK/ERK blocker PD 098059 (MEKi). When added together, p38i and MEKi decreased IL-1 beta -induced nitrite production over 24 hours by 60%, but did not affect IL-1 beta -induced manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) mRNA expression. To test the effects of MAPK inhibitors on beta-cell death by necrosis or apoptosis, these cells were exposed for 6 or 9 days to IL-1 beta + IFN-gamma. This treatment induced cell death, mostly by apoptosis. The MEKi, but not the p38i, significantly decreased cytokine-induced apoptosis, thus decreasing the total number of dead cells. This protection was only partial, suggesting that ERK1/2 activation is not the only mechanism by which cytokines induce beta-cell apoptosis.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors suppress the metabolism of the potent antihyperglycemic hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). DPP4 was recently shown to provide cardioprotection through a reduction of infarct size, but the mechanism for this remains elusive. Known interactions between DPP4 and adenosine deaminase (ADA) suggest an involvement of adenosine signaling in DPP4 inhibitor -mediated cardioprotection. We tested whether the protective mechanism of the DPP4 inhibitor alogliptin against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury involves GLP-1- and/or adenosine-dependent signaling in canine hearts. In anesthetized dogs, the coronary artery was occluded for 90 min followed by reperfusion for 6 h. A 4-day pretreatment with alogliptin reduced the infarct size from 43.1  2.5% to 17.1  5.0% without affecting collateral flow and hemodynamic parameters, indicating a potent antinecrotic effect. Alogliptin also suppressed apoptosis as demonstrated by the following analysis: 1) reduction in the Bax-to-Bcl2 ratio; 2) cytochrome c release, 3) an increase in Bad phosphorylation in the cytosolic fraction; and 4) terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay. This DPP4 inhibitor did not affect blood ADA activity or adenosine concentrations. In contrast, the nonselective adenosine receptor blocker 8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline (8SPT) completely blunted the effect of alogliptin.

Neonatal hypoxic pulmonary hypertension causes increases and spatial changes in tropoelastin expression in pulmonary arteries. However, it is not clear if this is due to recruitment of quiescent smooth muscle cells (SMC) into an elastin-producing phenotype or persistence of the fetal pattern of tropoelastin gene expression. We evaluated the distribution and relative concentration of tropoelastin mRNA in intralobar pulmonary arteries from late gestation fetuses and in animals exposed to hypobaric hypoxia (430 mmHg) from birth for 1, 3, 7, or 14 d, as well as in age-matched and adult room air-breathing controls. In situ hybridization demonstrated that tropoelastin mRNA was distributed throughout the entire radius of the pulmonary vessel wall in the fetus and newborn calf. By 15 d of age, only cells in the inner third of the media expressed tropoelastin mRNA, and by adulthood no tropoelastin mRNA was detected in the vessel wall. These findings demonstrated that tropoelastin expression shuts off in a spatially specific pattern, moving from the abluminal to the luminal side of the medial in the neonatal pulmonary artery when pressures and resistance are falling. In the aorta of 15-d-old calves, tropoelastin mRNA expression was seen equally throughout the media, indicating tissue-specific regulation of elastin in the neonatal period. In contrast, intralobar pulmonary arteries from calves exposed to hypoxia, which prevented the normal postnatal decline in pulmonary artery pressure, maintained the fetal pattern and levels of tropoelastin mRNA expression at all time points. Thus, rather than causing a recruitment of SMC into an elastin-producing phenotype, neonatal pulmonary hypertension caused a persistence of the fetal pattern of tropoelastin expression in medial SMC.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) joints are in a hypoxic condition. Hypoxia-induced migration and invasion of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) are considered to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of RA. Among the key genes upregulated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 ( HIF-1 ), CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) plays an important role in FLS migration and invasion. Our previous studies have shown that celastrol exerts anti-arthritic effects by inhibiting FLS migration and invasion under normoxic conditions. However, the effect and molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of celastrol on hypoxia-induced FLS migration and invasion are poorly understood. In the present study, we assessed the effect of celastrol on hypoxia-induced FLS migration and invasion. Results showed that celastrol suppressed hypoxia-induced FLS migration and invasion. In addition, we also found that celastrol inhibited hypoxia-induced CXCR4 expression at both the mRNA and the protein levels in RA-FLSs. Meanwhile, it is revealed that celastrol inhibited the transcriptional activity of CXCR4 under hypoxic conditions by suppressing the binding activity of HIF-1  in the CXCR4 promoter, and blocked hypoxia-induced accumulation of nuclear HIF-1.

Given the role of ANG II in diabetic kidney disease, we chose to study the effect of ANG II on GFAT promoter activity in mesangial cells (MC). Exposure of MC to ANG II (10(-7) M) increased GFAT promoter activity (2.5-fold), mRNA (3-fold), and protein (1.6-fold). ANG II -mediated GFAT promoter activation was inhibited by the ANG II type I receptor antagonist candesartan (10(-8) M) but was unaffected by the ANG II type II receptor antagonist PD-123319 (10(-8) M). The intracellular calcium chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (10(-6) M), protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors bisindoylmaleimide-4 (10(-6) M) and calphostin C (10(-7) M), protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitor genistein (10(-4) M), Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 (2.5 x 10(-7) M), p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor PD-98059 (10(-5) M), and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) inhibitor AG-1478 all attenuated GFAT promoter activation by ANG II.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The E7 oncoprotein of the high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) is thought to contribute to cervical carcinogenesis at least in part by abrogating cell cycle regulation. E7 can dysregulate the cell cycle through its interaction with several cellular proteins including the retinoblastoma suppressor protein pRb, as well as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (Cip1). Inactivation of pRb in cervical epithelia is not sufficient to explain the ability of E7 to cause cervical cancers in transgenic mice. In the current study, we focused on the role of p21 (Cip1) in cervical cancer. Cervical disease was significantly increased in p21 (-/-) mice compared with p21 (+/+) mice, showing that p21 (Cip1) can function as a tumor suppressor in this tissue. Importantly, the ability of E7 to induce cervical cancers was not significantly enhanced on the p21 -null background, consistent with the hypothesis that the ability of E7 to inhibit p21 (Cip1) contributes to its carcinogenic properties. Further supportive of this hypothesis, cervical carcinogenesis in mice expressing a mutant form of HPV-16 E7, E7 (CVQ), which fails to inactivate p21 (Cip1), was significantly reduced compared with that in K14E7(WT) mice expressing wild-type HPV-16 E7. However, K14E7(CVQ) mice still displayed heightened levels of cervical carcinogenesis compared with that in nontransgenic mice, indicating that activities of E7 besides its capacity to inactivate p21 (Cip1) also contribute to cervical carcinogenesis.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
Taken together, we conclude that <re> p21 <er>(Cip1) functions as a tumor suppressor in cervical carcinogenesis and that <re> p21 <er>(Cip1) inactivation by HPV-16 <el> E7 <le> partially contributes to the contribution of <el> E7 <le> to cervical carcinogenesis. positive----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

We have previously shown in the rat slow-twitch soleus muscle that adrenaline greatly potentiates insulin -stimulated protein kinase B ( PKB ) phosphorylation without having an effect alone. However, insulin signalling capacity through the PKB pathway is higher in soleus than in fast-twitch muscles, whereas adrenaline activates phosphorylase more strongly in epitrochlearis. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the interaction between adrenaline and insulin signalling in the fast-twitch epitrochlearis muscle. Insulin increased insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)-associated phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase activity threefold, and adrenaline did not influence basal or insulin -stimulated PI 3-kinase activity. Insulin but not adrenaline increased PKB activity and phosphorylation of Ser(473) and Thr(308). It is interesting to note that adrenaline potentiated insulin -stimulated PKB activity and PKB Ser(473) and Thr(308) phosphorylation. These effects were mimicked by dibutyryl-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (db-cAMP). Adrenaline and db-cAMP increased glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta Ser(9) phosphorylation independently of PKB activation and enhanced insulin -stimulated GSK-3beta Ser(9) phosphorylation. Although adrenaline increased GSK-3 phosphorylation (inhibiting activity), phosphorylation of its target sites on glycogen synthase was increased, and adrenaline blocked insulin -stimulated glycogen synthase dephosphorylation of Ser(641) and Ser(645,649,653,657), glycogen synthase activation and glycogen synthesis. Insulin-stimulated glucose transport was not influenced by adrenaline despite the increased PKB activation.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Raf kinase inhibitor protein ( RKIP ) on the growth, apoptosis, invasion, and metastasis of human hepatic stellate cell line (LX-2). A recombinant plasmid (pcDNA3.1- RKIP ) or RKIP -targeting small interfering RNA (siRNA) vector (siRNA- RKIP ) was transfected into LX-2 cells to interfere with the RKIP expression. The results demonstrated that increased RKIP expression significantly reduced cell viability, clonogenic growth, and invasion. Further, it promoted cell apoptosis and induced cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. Overexpression of RKIP led to inactivation of LX-2 cells, as evidenced by the decrease in the expression levels of collagen I and -smooth muscle actin (-SMA). In addition, increased RKIP expression significantly reduced the phosphorylation of Raf/extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK )/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor-B (NF-B), and the levels of matrix metalloproteinases-1 and -2.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Antibodies that impede the invasion of Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) merozoites into erythrocytes play a critical role in anti-malarial immunity. The Growth Inhibition Assay (GIA) is an in vitro measure of the functional capacity of such antibodies to limit erythrocyte invasion and/or parasite growth. Up to now, it is unclear whether growth-inhibitory activity correlates with protection from clinical disease and there are inconsistent results from studies performed with GIA. Studies that have focused on the relationship between IgG s and their in vitro parasite Growth Inhibition Activity (GIAc) in infants aged less than two years old are rare. Here, we used clinical and parasitological data to precisely define symptomatic or asymptomatic infection with P. falciparum in groups of infants followed-up actively for 18 months post-natally. We quantified the levels of IgG 1 and IgG 3 directed to a panel of candidate P. falciparum vaccine antigens (AMA-1, MSP1, 2, 3 and GLURP) using ELISA and the functional activity of IgG was quantified using GIA. Data were then correlated with individuals' infection status. At 18 months of age, infants harbouring infection s at the time of blood sampling had an average 19% less GIAc than those not infected (p=0.004, multivariate linear regression). GIAc decreased from 12 to 18 months of age (p=0.003, Wilcoxon matched pairs test). Antibody levels quantified at 18 months in infants were strongly correlated with their exposure to malarial infection, however GIAc was not correlated with malaria infectious status (asymptomatic and symptomatic groups).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Deguelin is a naturally occurring rotenoid with strong cancer chemopreventive and antitumor activities. In the present study, we investigated the antitumor activity of deguelin against MPC-11 murine myeloma cells and the possible mechanism of action in vitro. Our results revealed that deguelin inhibited the proliferation of MPC-11 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner and caused the apoptotic death of MPC-11 cells. Following exposure to deguelin, the phosphorylation of Akt was decreased. The inhibition of cell growth may be associated with decreased levels of phosphorylated Akt.

In experiments on slices (from 100- to 150-g Sprague-Dawley rats) kept at 33 degreesC, we studied the effects of brief hypoxia (2-3 min) on CA1 neurons. In whole cell recordings from submerged slices, with electrodes containing only KMeSO4 and N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid, and in the presence of kynurenate and bicuculline (to minimize transmitter actions), hypoxia produced the following changes: under current clamp, 36 cells were hyperpolarized by 2.7 +/- 0.5 (SE) mV and their input resistance (Rin) fell by 23 +/- 2.7%; in 30 cells under voltage clamp, membrane current increased by 114 +/- 22.3 pA and input conductance (Gin) by 4.9 +/- 0.9 nS. These effects are much greater than those seen previously with K gluconate whole cell electrodes, but only half those seen with "sharp" electrodes. The hypoxic hyperpolarizations (or outward currents) were not reduced by intracellular ATP (1-5 mM) or bath-applied glyburide (10 microM): therefore they are unlikely to be mediated by conventional ATP-sensitive K channels. On the other hand, their depression by internally applied ethylene glycol-bis-(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N, N',N'-tetraacetic acid (1.1 and 11 mM) and especially 1, 2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (11-33 mM) indicated a significant involvement of Ca-dependent K (KCa) channels.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

In vitro field potential recordings and immunocytochemistry were performed in the CA1 region in slices from nave, post- FPI, or sham-operated rats. The following electrophysiological and morphological parameters were affected following FPI : (1) threshold for population spike generation was increased suggesting that post- FPI neurons were hypoexcitable; (2) long-term potentiation ( LTP ) could not be induced in injured hippocampi; (3) GFAP and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) immunoreactivity were enhanced post- FPI ; and (4) following injury, synaptophysin immunoreactivity was enhanced in CA1 stratum radiatum. The effects of FPI on synaptic plasticity were LTP -specific, since long-term depression (LTD) could be equally induced and maintained in post- FPI, sham-operated and control slices.

Understanding the dynamics of autophagy and apoptosis crosstalk in cancer progression remains a challenging task. Here, we reported how the autophagy protein ATG14 induces lipophagy -mediated mitochondrial apoptosis. The overexpression of ATG14 in HeLa cells inhibited cell viability and increased mitochondrial apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Furthermore, inhibition of this ATG14-induced autophagy promoted apoptosis. ATG14 overexpression resulted in the accumulation of free fatty acids (FFA), with a concomitant decrease in the number of lipid droplets. Our data showed that ER stress induced by ATG14 was due to the lipophagy -mediated FFA accumulation, which resulted in ROS-dependent mitochondrial stress leading to apoptosis. Inhibition of lipophagy in HeLa-ATG14 cells enhanced the cellular viability and rescued them from lipotoxicity. Mechanistically, we found that ATG14 interacted with Ulk1 and LC3, and knock down of Ulk1 prevented the lipidation of LC3 and autophagy in HeLa-ATG14 cells. We also identified a phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) binding region in ATG14, and the addition of Ulk1 to Hela-ATG14 cells decreased the ATG14-PE interaction. Lastly, confocal microscopy studies showed that the decrease in ATG14-PE binding was concomitant with the increase in LC3 lipidation over time, confirming the importance of Ulk1 to sort PE to LC3 during ATG14 mediated lipophagy induction.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Coadministration of the iron chelator dexrazoxane reduces by 80% the incidence of heart failure in cancer patients treated with anthracyclines. The clinical application of dexrazoxane is limited, however, because its ability to inhibit topoisomerase II ( TOP2A ) is feared to adversely affect anthracycline chemotherapy, which involves TOP2A -mediated generation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). Here, we investigated the apoptotic effects of dexrazoxane and the anthracycline doxorubicin, alone and in combination, in a tumor cell line with conditionally regulated expression of TOP2A. Each drug caused apoptosis that was only partly dependent on TOP2A. Unexpectedly, dexrazoxane was found to cause TOP2A depletion, thereby reducing the doxorubicin-induced accumulation of DSB. Despite this latter effect, dexrazoxane showed no adverse effect on doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. This could be explained by the TOP2A -independent apoptotic effects of each drug: those of doxorubicin included TOP2A -independent DSB formation and depletion of intracellular glutathione, whereas those of dexrazoxane were caspase independent.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Glucagon is secreted from pancreatic  cells, and hypersecretion (hyperglucagonemia) contributes to diabetic hyperglycemia. Molecular heterogeneity in hyperglucagonemia is poorly investigated. By screening human plasma using high-resolution-proteomics, we identified several glucagon variants, among which proglucagon 1-61 (PG 1-61) appears to be the most abundant form. PG 1-61 is secreted in subjects with obesity, both before and after gastric bypass surgery, with protein and fat as the main drivers for secretion before surgery, but glucose after. Studies in hepatocytes and in  cells demonstrated that PG 1-61 dose-dependently increases levels of cAMP, through the glucagon receptor, and increases insulin secretion and protein levels of enzymes regulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.

Hyperhomocysteinemia reduces neurogenesis in the adult mouse brain. Homocysteine (Hcy) inhibits postnatal neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation by specifically impairing the fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR )-Erk1/2-cyclin E signaling pathway. We demonstrate herein that the inhibition of FGFR -dependent NPC proliferation induced by Hcy is mediated by its capacity to alter the cellular methylation potential. Our results show that this alteration modified the expression pattern and activity of Sprouty2 ( Spry2 ), a negative regulator of the above mentioned pathway. Both elevated concentrations of Hcy and methyltransferase activity inhibition induced Spry2 promoter demethylation in NPC cultures leading to a sustained upregulation of the expression of Spry2 mRNA and protein. In addition, protein levels of two kinases responsible for Spry2 activation/deactivation were altered by Hcy: Spry2 kinase Dyrk1A levels diminished while Spry2 phosphatase PP2A increased, leading to changes in the phosphorylation pattern, activity and stability of Spry2.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia ( HHT ), or Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome, is a dominant genetic vascular disorder. In HHT, blood vessels are weak and prone to bleeding, leading to epistaxis and anaemia, severely affecting patients' quality of life. Development of vascular malformations in HHT patients is originated mainly by mutations in ACVRL1/ALK1 (activin receptor-like kinase type I) or Endoglin (ENG) genes. These genes encode proteins of the TGF- signalling pathway in endothelial cells, controlling angiogenesis. Haploinsufficiency of these proteins is the basis of HHT pathogenicity. It was our objective to study the efficiency of Bazedoxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) in HHT, looking for a decrease in epistaxis, and understanding the underlying molecular mechanism. Plasma samples of five HHT patients were collected before, and after 1 and 3 months of Bazedoxifene treatment. ENG and ALK1 expression in activated mononuclear cells derived from blood, as well as VEGF plasma levels, were measured. Quantification of Endoglin and ALK1 mRNA was done in endothelial cells derived from HHT and healthy donors, after in vitro treatment with Bazedoxifene. Angiogenesis was also measured by tubulogenesis and wound healing assays. Upon Bazedoxifene treatment, haemoglobin levels of HHT patients increased and the quantity and frequency of epistaxis decreased.

The inflammatory response in iNOSKO mice was significantly reduced in respect to iNOSWT animals, as demonstrated by the exudate volume (-63%) and numbers of infiltrating cells (-62%).

It is now well established that dietary lipids are incorporated into macrophage and T-cell membrane microdomains, altering their structure and function. Within cell membranes, there are specific detergent-resistant domains in which key signal transduction proteins are localized. These regions are classified as "lipid rafts". Rafts are composed mostly of cholesterol and sphingolipids and therefore do not integrate well into the fluid phospholipid bilayers causing them to form microdomains. Upon cell activation, rafts compartmentalize signal-transducing molecules, thus providing an environment conducive to signal transduction. In this review, we discuss recent novel data describing the effects of n-3 PUFA on alterations in the activation and functions of macrophages and T-cells.

The auditory middle latency response (AMLR) and the 40-Hz auditory steady-state response ( 40-Hz ASSR ) are evoked potentials which possibly arise from the same generators in the primary auditory cortex. Both responses are attenuated by most general anaesthetics. Ketamine, however, has been reported to have no effect on the AMLR. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of ketamine on the 40-Hz ASSR. Spectral analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) was also conducted to independently examine the effects of ketamine. Ketamine 1.5 mg kg-1 was given to 12 patients for induction of general anaesthesia. Recordings of the 40-Hz ASSR and EEG were obtained every minute from 3 min before administration of ketamine to 5 min after injection, when the study was terminated. Similar recordings were obtained in three control subjects under identical conditions except that no medication was administered. Consciousness, defined as responsiveness to verbal commands, was assessed before each recording. Ketamine caused an increase in the amplitude of the 40-Hz ASSR (P  0.01). Using published AMLR data, we conducted a simulation experiment that suggested that the effect of ketamine on the AMLR can explain its effects on the amplitude of the 40-Hz ASSR. There was a pronounced increase in relative theta (3.9-7.9 Hz) EEG power and a decrease in relative alpha (8.0-12.8 Hz) power (P  0.001). These changes were not observed in the control group. Ketamine produced unconsciousness until the end of the study in five patients and transient unconsciousness in five patients. Two patients did not lose consciousness after administration of ketamine. The 40-Hz ASSR and EEG revealed no consistent differences between conscious and unconscious patients. No relationship could be demonstrated between the increase in amplitude of the 40-Hz ASSR or of relative theta power (the hallmark of ketamine effect) and loss of responsiveness to commands.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Leptin, the satiety hormone expressed almost exclusively in adipose tissue, is a marker of body fat accumulation in humans. Recent studies have shown that plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( PAI-1 ), a prothrombotic factor associated with atherosclerosis complications, is also produced in adipose tissue. The objective of the present study was to determine whether PAI-1 antigen plasma concentrations are associated with leptin plasma levels or the body fat mass (FM) independently of the variables known to influence PAI-1 production. Sixty-one nondiabetic women aged 18 to 45 years with a wide range of values for the body mass index ([BMI] 18.1 to 37.7 kg/m2) were evaluated for (1) body FM and fasting plasma levels of (2) PAI-1 antigen, (3) PAI-1 activity, (4) leptin, (5) insulin, (6) blood glucose, and (7) lipids (cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL]-cholesterol, and triglycerides [TG]). Body FM and fat-free mass (FFM) were estimated during fasting conditions by the bioimpedance analysis (BIA) method using a tetrapolar device. Body fat distribution was evaluated by the waist circumference and the waist to hip ratio (WHR). FM was directly associated with both PAI-1 antigen (r =.585, P .001) and PAI-1 activity (r =.339, P .001). Seemingly, leptin was positively related to both PAI-1 antigen (r =.630, P .001) and PAI-1 activity (r =.497, P .001).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We performed a double-blind, randomized, prospective study to determine the local anesthetic that provided the best analgesia for insertion of an 18-gauge intravenous (i.v.) catheter and to determine whether alkalinization of lidocaine decreases the pain of intradermal injection. There were 280 healthy adult patients assigned randomly to seven different groups: benzyl alcohol 0.9% in normal saline, 2-chloroprocaine 3%, lidocaine 1%, lidocaine 1% with preservative, alkalinized lidocaine 1% with preservative, normal saline, and a control group that received i.v. catheter placement without previous drug injection. A 10-cm visual analog pain scale (VAPS) was used to obtain pain scores after pre-i.v. drug injection and after iv catheter insertion. Benzyl alcohol in normal saline (0.61 +/- 0.11) and alkalinized lidocaine (0.69 +/- 0.10) had the lowest mean pain scores for drug injection and these were significantly different from other drugs (P  0.05). Alkalinized lidocaine (0.7 +/- 0.18) had the lowest mean pain score for i.v. catheter insertion with nothing (no previous drug injected) (3.47 +/- 0.38) and normal saline (3.97 +/- 0.18) had the highest mean pain scores (P  0.05).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

It is not known whether positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) merely improves gas exchange in patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome or also affects the resolution of their lung injury. We examined the effects of expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP), a form of PEEP, on 13 pairs of spontaneously breathing mongrel dogs with permanent tracheostomies that were subjected to acute lung injury from oleic acid. One member of each pair was treated with 10 cm H2O EPAP by means of a special valve attached to its tracheostomy tube; the other member breathed through the tracheostomy tube alone. The EPAP was applied 3 h after an intravenous injection of 0.06 ml/kg oleic acid and continued for a total of 21 h. Functional residual capacity (FRC) was increased to preinjury values in the EPAP-treated dogs at 3, 12, and 24 h compared with that in the untreated dogs. The PaO2 was higher and the venous admixture (Qva/QT) was lower in the EPAP-treated dogs compared with that in the untreated dogs at 3 and at 12 h. However, over the 7 days after removal of EPAP no significant differences were noted between the 2 groups in FRC, PaO2, Qva/QT, inert gas elimination profiles, mortality, final lung compliance to initial lung compliance differences, lung water to dry lung weight ratios, or histologic features.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

In intact rat pancreatic acini, the phospholipase A2 inhibitor mepacrine did not affect basal amylase release but dose-dependently inhibited the carbachol (IC50 65 microM) and CCK-8 (IC50 210 microM)-stimulated amylase release.

Latent transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-binding protein (LTBP) is required for the assembly, secretion, matrix association, and activation of latent TGF-beta complex. To elucidate the cell specific expression of the genes of LTBP-1 and their splice variants and the factors that regulate the gene expression, we cultured primary human glomerular endothelial cells (HGEC) under different conditions. Basal expression of LTBP-1 mRNA was suppressed in HGEC compared to WI-38 human embryonic lung fibroblasts. High glucose, H(2)O(2), and TGF-beta1 upregulated and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) further downregulated LTBP-1 mRNA in HGEC. RT-PCR with a primer set for LTBP-1 S produced many clones but no clone was gained with a primer set for LTBP-1 L. Of 12 clones selected randomly, Sca I mapping and DNA sequencing revealed that only one was LTBP-1 S and all the others were LTBP-1 Sdelta53.

1. The effect of the lanthanide cation Gd3+ on voltage-dependent calcium currents in neuroblastoma x glioma (NG108-15) cells has been studied using a whole-cell clamp technique. 2. Gd3+ reduced the amplitude of calcium currents. The amount of inhibition produced by Gd3+ was concentration dependent between about 0.5 and 5 microM and reached a maximum at about 10-20 microM. 3. A proportion of the total calcium current was resistant to blockade by Gd3+. 4. Gd3+ -resistant calcium current consisted of two components: a rapidly inactivating, 'fast' component which was activated at potentials more positive than about -45 mV, and a long-lasting,'slow' component which was activated at potentials more positive than about -10 mV. 5. It was possible to isolate the slow component, in the presence of Gd3+, by selectively inactivating the fast component with a brief depolarizing pre-pulse. The fast and slow components of current probably reflect the activity of two subpopulations of calcium channels which are resistant to block by Gd3+. 6. In control conditions inactivation of calcium current could be described by the sum of a fast (tau congruent to 40 ms at +10 mV) and a slow (tau congruent to 800 ms at +10 mV) exponential decay plus a constant. Gd3+ selectively blocked the slowly decaying current. 7. The current blocked by Gd3+ was activated at potentials more positive than about -35 mV and decayed monoexponentially (tau congruent to 800 ms at +10 mV). 8.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 ( PARP1 ) is a nuclear enzyme that can trigger caspase-independent necrosis. Two main mechanisms for this have been proposed: one involving RIP1 and JNK kinases and mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), the other involving calpain-mediated activation of Bax and mitochondrial release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). However, whether these two mechanisms represent distinct pathways for PARP1 -induced necrosis, or whether they are simply different components of the same pathway has yet to be tested. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were treated with either N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) or -Lapachone, resulting in PARP1 -dependent necrosis. This was associated with increases in calpain activity, JNK activation and AIF translocation. JNK inhibition significantly reduced MNNG- and -Lapachone-induced JNK activation, AIF translocation, and necrosis, but not calpain activation. In contrast, inhibition of calpain either by Ca(2+) chelation or knockdown attenuated necrosis, but did not affect JNK activation or AIF translocation. To our surprise, genetic and/or pharmacological inhibition of RIP1, AIF, Bax and the MPT pore failed to abrogate MNNG- and -Lapachone-induced necrosis.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Loop diuretics such as bumetanide and furosemide enhance aminoglycoside ototoxicity when co-administered to patients and animal models. The underlying mechanism(s) is poorly understood. We investigated the effect of these diuretics on cellular uptake of aminoglycosides, using Texas Red-tagged gentamicin (GTTR), and intracellular/whole-cell recordings of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. We found that bumetanide and furosemide dose-dependently enhanced cytoplasmic GTTR fluorescence by 60 %. This enhancement was suppressed by La(3+), a non-selective cation channel (NSCC) blocker, and by K(+) channel blockers Ba(2+) and clotrimazole, but not by tetraethylammonium (TEA), 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) or glipizide, nor by Cl(-) channel blockers diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid (DPC), niflumic acid (NFA), and CFTRinh-172. Bumetanide and furosemide hyperpolarized MDCK cells by 14 mV, increased whole-cell I/V slope conductance; the bumetanide -induced net current I/V showed a reversal potential (V r) -80 mV. Bumetanide-induced hyperpolarization and I/V change was suppressed by Ba(2+) or clotrimazole, and absent in elevated [ Ca (2+)]i, but was not affected by apamin, 4-AP, TEA, glipizide, DPC, NFA, or CFTRinh-172.

Doxorubicin ( DOX ) is a potent, broad-spectrum chemotherapeutic drug used for treatment of several types of cancers. Despite its effectiveness, it has a wide range of toxic side effects, many of which most likely result from its inherent prooxidant activity. It has been reported that DOX has toxic effects on normal tissues, including brain tissue. In the current study, we investigated the protective effect of osthole isolated from Prangos ferulacea (L.) Lindl. on oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by DOX in PC12 as a neuronal model cell line. PC12 cells were pretreated with osthole 2 h after treatment with different concentrations of DOX. 24 h later, the cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), the activity of caspase-3, the expression ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, and the generation of intracellular ROS were detected. We found that pretreatment with osthole on PC12 cells significantly reduced the loss of cell viability, the activity of caspase-3, the increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and the generation of intracellular ROS induced by DOX.

Splenomegaly is uncommon in myelodysplasia ( MDS ) and, although cytopenias may be severe, therapeutic splenectomy is rarely performed. We report the histologic, histochemical, and immunophenotypic findings of nine cases of surgical splenectomy and four postmortem spleens from MDS patients. Four histologic patterns were identified: one dominated by erythrophagocytosis, one characterized by red pulp plasmacytosis, one with extramedullary hematopoiesis as the only salient finding, and one with marked red pulp expansion caused by a monocytic proliferation. Wright-Giemsa and histochemical stains were performed on touch preparations in three cases and played a critical role in the precise subclassification of one MDS patient's hematologic disorder, which ultimately proved to be chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Splenectomy led to sustained improvement of cytopenias in three cases, but did not eliminate transfusion dependence for the remaining patients. Three splenectomy cases exhibited clustered Leder-negative mononuclear elements: two of these patients experienced disease progression to refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation or acute myelogenous leukemia during post-splenectomy follow-up, whereas none of the three splenectomy patients without clustered mononuclear elements did.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

1,5-Anhydro-D-fructose (AF) is a mono-saccharide directly formed from starch and glycogen by the action of -1,4-glucan lyase (EC 4.2.2.13). Our previous study has indicated that AF increases glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in NMRI mice after administration through a gastric gavage in a single dose at 150 mg per mouse. In this study, we used high-fat feeding of C57BL/6J mice to examine the influence of long-term administration of AF on glucose -stimulated insulin secretion in vivo and in vitro. We found that 8-weeks of high-fat feeding increased body weight, fasting blood glucose and insulin levels in C57BL/6J mice when compared to mice fed normal diet. Impaired glucose tolerance was also observed in mice receiving 8-weeks of high-fat diet. In contrast, AF (1.5 g/kg/day), administered through drinking water for 8-weeks, did not affect body weight or food and water intake in mice fed either the high-fat or normal diet. There was no difference in basal blood glucose or insulin levels between AF-treated and control group.

Activation of Toll-like receptor-4 ( TLR-4 ) in articular chondrocytes increases the catabolic compartment and leads to matrix degradation during the development of osteoarthritis. In this study, we determined the proteomic and genomic alterations in human chondrocytes during lipopolysaccharide ( LPS )-induced inflammation to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and consequences of TLR-4 activation. Human chondrocytes were cultured with LPS for 12, 24, and 36 h to induce TLR-4 activation. The TLR-4 -induced inflammatory response was confirmed by real-time PCR analysis of increased interleukin-1 beta (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) expression levels. In TLR-4 -activated chondrocytes, proteomic changes were determined by two-dimensional electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectroscopy analysis, and genomic changes were determined by microarray and gene ontology analyses. Proteomics analysis identified 26 proteins with significantly altered expression levels; these proteins were related to the cytoskeleton and oxidative stress responses. Gene ontology analysis indicated that LPS treatment altered specific functional pathways including 'chemotaxis', 'hematopoietic organ development', 'positive regulation of cell proliferation', and'regulation of cytokine biosynthetic process'. Nine of the 26 identified proteins displayed the same increased expression patterns in both proteomics and genomics analyses.

IFN-gamma plays a crucial role in the defense against infection with Candida albicans. Since IL-18 and IL-12 are strong stimuli of IFN-gamma production, we investigated whether endogenous IL-18 and IL-12 are involved in the host defense during disseminated candidiasis. IL-18 knockout ( IL-18 -/-) mice, but not IL-12-/- mice, displayed an increased mortality due to C. albicans infection, accompanied by a decreased clearance of the yeasts from the kidneys late during the course of infection. Histopathology of the organs, combined with phagocyte recruitment experiments, showed a decreased influx of monocytes at the sites of Candida infection, mainly in the IL-18 -/- mice. Whereas production of the chemokine KC was decreased in both IL-18 -/- and IL-12-/- mice, MIP-2 production was deficient only in IL-18 -/- animals, which may explain the differences in phagocyte recruitment. In addition, although IFN-gamma production capacity, as a parameter of the Th1-protective immunity, was reduced by 65 to 80% in the IL-12-/- mice, this defect was even more pronounced in the IL-18 -/- mice (85 to 95% down-modulation).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

During a dose-response study (300, 600, and 1500 micrograms/day sc, for 4 weeks), serum GH decreased significantly after 300 micrograms/day in 8 of 12 patients [from 14.5 +/- 6.2 (+/- SE) to 4.9 +/- 1.9 micrograms/L]. Higher doses further reduced serum GH concentrations in 3 (600 micrograms/day) and 1 (1500 micrograms/day) patients, respectively. Four patients did not respond to any dose. Serum GH concentrations declined normally ( GH nadir, less than 2 micrograms/L) after glucose ingestion in 4 of the 10 nondiabetic acromegalic patients. In 4 patients, including 2 of the initial nonresponders, serum GH further declined during long term treatment (12 and 18 months). In the latter 2 patients, serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentrations had decreased during the dose-response study despite the absence of measurable GH suppression. Eight patients attained normal serum IGF-I concentrations during treatment. Serum IGF-I and GH correlated significantly before, but not during, treatment. Retrospective comparison suggested that in 5 of 6 patients, serum GH was more effectively suppressed by octreotide than by bromocriptine. The 24-h serum octreotide concentration varied greatly among the patients. Although the 24-h serum octreotide and GH concentrations did not correlate with one another, the serum octreotide and IGF-I concentrations when the patients were receiving 300 micrograms/day tended to be negatively correlated (r = -0.496; P = 0.118).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Epibatidine has been used in a wide dose range and was found to produce both nociceptive and antinociceptive effects. The different effects were partly explained by an action on multiple nicotinic receptor systems. The present study investigated the possibility that part of the action of intraspinally or subcutaneously administered (+/-) epibatidine, is mediated through an action on muscarinic receptor s. Radioligand receptor assays were performed using homogenates of rat spinal cord and muscarinic M1-M5 receptors expressed in Sf9 cells. The intraspinal acetylcholine releasing effect of intraspinally and subcutaneously administered (+/-) epibatidine was studied with and without with atropine pretreatment. (+/-) Epibatidine has affinity for muscarinic receptor s both in spinal cord tissue and expressed in Sf9 cells. The intraspinal administration of 160 microM (+/-) epibatidine produced an increase in acetylcholine release that was reduced by pretreatment with 100 microM atropine. Subcutaneous administration of 30 microg/kg (+/-) epibatidine produced an increase in intraspinal acetylcholine release that was not inhibited by 5 mg/kg subcutaneous atropine pretreatment.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The effect of ketamine on intraocular pressure ( IOP ) was studied in 10 children. Control IOP values were determined prior to induction of anesthesia, following premedication with atropine alone or in combination with pentobarbital and meperidine. After the IM injection of 8 mg/kg of ketamine, the IOP was determined at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes. Mean (+/- SD) IOP values before and after ketamine were 22.2 +/- 4.8 and 16.7 +/- 3.3 torr (p less than 0.001), respectively. The authors believe that the reduction in IOP was not due to ketamine, per se, but rather to lack of patient relaxation and cooperation during control measurements. At the end of 20 minutes, a second dose of ketamine, this time 1 mg/kg IV, was given and measurements were repeated at the same intervals. In 5 patients, the effects on IOP of d-tubocurarine, endotracheal intubation, and N2O inhalation also was evaluated. A significant increase (6.7 torr) in IOP was observed only after endotracheal intubation.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The presence of elevated T lymphocytic microparticles (TLMPs) during respiratory illness is associated with airway and lung inflammation and epithelial injuries. Although inflammasome and IL-1 signaling are crucial in airway inflammation, little was known about their regulatory mechanism. We hypothesized that TLMPs trigger inflammasome activation and IL-1 production in bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells to induce airway and lung inflammation. In this study, TLMPs induced IL-1 and IL-18 secretion through NLRP3 inflammasome activation and upregulated TLR4 mRNA and protein expression in alveolar (A549) and human airway epithelial (16HBE) cells. Pretreatment with CLI-095, a specific inhibitor of TLR4 signaling, dramatically diminished the TLMP-induced release of IL-1 and IL-18 by inhibiting the formation of NLRP3/ASC/pro-caspase-1 inflammasome in a dose-dependent manner. The TLMP-induced autophagy inhibition in epithelial cells was dependent on the PI3K /Akt signaling pathway, which significantly increased NLRP3 expression and enhanced TLMP-induced inflammation. TLR4, IL-1, and IL-18 proteins harbored in TLMPs were nonessential for the pro-inflammatory effect.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

To investigate shear stress-induced platelet activation, the cone-plate viscometer or the Couette rotational viscometer has been widely used. In a previous report, it was shown that shearing platelet-rich plasma using a Couette rotational viscometer could lead to an increase in pH by CO(2) release. However, any clear mechanism has not been provided. In this study, we examined whether shearing cell free plasma only using a cone-plate viscometer can also induce pH increase and studied the underlying mechanism of shear-induced pH increase by directly measuring total CO(2) (T(CO(2))) and CO(2) tension (P(CO(2))). When human plasma was sheared using a cone-plate viscometer, the pH of the human plasma increased time- and shear rate-dependently. Although T(CO(2)) of human plasma was not affected, P(CO(2)) was decreased by shearing, indicating that the decreased P(CO(2)) is associated with a pH increase of plasma. In addition, the pH of bicarbonate -containing suspension buffer was also shown to be increased by shearing; suggesting that the platelet studies using suspension buffers containing bicarbonate could be affected similarly. The effects of pH changes on shear stress-induced platelet activation were also investigated in the same in vitro systems. While shear stress-induced platelet aggregation was not affected by the pH changes, P-selectin expression was significantly increased in accordance with the pH increase.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
In conclusion, shear stress using a cone-plate viscometer induces <el> pH <le> increase in plasma or <re> bicarbonate <er>-containing suspension buffer through a P(CO(2)) decrease and the <el> pH <le> changes alone can contribute to platelet activation by enhancing shear stress-induced P-selectin expression. positive----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

In the present study we have demonstrated that Salmonella typhimurium infection in mice leads to a progressive loss of CD4+ T helper (Th) cell population, abnormal T- cell death by apoptosis and loss of accessory molecules (B7 and intracellular adhesion molecule-1) on macrophages. Quantification of interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) secretion revealed a Th2-type of response in lymphocytes isolated from spleen. However, preimmunization of mice with porins resulted in an increased CD4+ Th cell population and accessory molecules on the surface of macrophages.

In the present study, it was hypothesized that the adrenocorticotrophin hormone receptor ( ACTH -R) would be up-regulated in the adrenal gland of the sheep fetus following infusion of physiological amounts of ACTH, as shown for adrenal cortical cells in culture. In chronically catheterized sheep, an intravenous infusion of ACTH (1-24) was given to 6 fetuses for 24 h at a rate of 0.5 microg h(-1), starting on Day 126 or 127 of gestation (term approximately 147 days). Four control fetuses received an infusion of vehicle (saline). Total RNA was extracted from the fetal adrenal glands by the guanidinium thiocyanate method. Expression of specific mRNAs was determined by ribonuclease protection assay using cRNA probes directed against: ACTH -R; the steroid enzymes side-chain cleavage (P450scc), 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3beta-HSD), 17apha-hydroxylase (P450c17) and 21beta-hydroxylase (P450c21); and beta-actin. Ratios of mRNA expression to beta-actin mRNA expression (arbitrary units) were calculated to correct for differences in RNA quality between samples. The concentration (mean +/- SEM) of immunoreactive cortisol in fetal plasma was greater after ACTH infusion than after vehicle infusion (47 +/- 3 v. 13 +/- 2 ng mL(-1) respectively; P0.001). Adrenal expression of P450scc and P450c21 mRNA increased after ACTH infusion (P0.05), whereas expression of P450c17 and 3beta-HSD mRNA was unchanged.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Interactions arising from sequential viral and bacterial infection s play important roles in the epidemiological outcome of many respiratory pathogens. Influenza virus has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several respiratory bacterial pathogens commonly associated with pneumonia. Though clinical evidence supporting this interaction is unambiguous, its population-level effects-magnitude, epidemiological impact and variation during pandemic and seasonal outbreaks-remain unclear. To address these unknowns, we used longitudinal influenza and pneumonia incidence data, at different spatial resolutions and across different epidemiological periods, to infer the nature, timing and the intensity of influenza- pneumonia interaction. We used a mechanistic transmission model within a likelihood-based inference framework to carry out formal hypothesis testing. Irrespective of the source of data examined, we found that influenza infection increases the risk of pneumonia by 100-fold. We found no support for enhanced transmission or severity impact of the interaction. For model-validation, we challenged our fitted model to make out-of-sample pneumonia predictions during pandemic and non-pandemic periods.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Recent investigations suggest that hypoxia increases the release of fatty acids, which participate in the regulation of cytokine synthesis and cell growth. Therefore, in this study, we examined the effect of arachidonic acid ( AA ) on hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and its related signaling pathways in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Hypoxia increased the level of [(3)H] AA release and VEGF expression. AA treatment concurrent with hypoxia further increased the PGE(2) production and VEGF expression level, which was inhibited by the suppression of cPLA(2) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) pathways. Hypoxia increased the level of Notch-1 and Wnt-1/beta-catenin expression, which was blocked by the inhibition of COX-2, and inhibition of Notch-1 by gamma-secretase inhibitor blocked Wnt-1 activation. Moreover, the hypoxia-induced increase of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) expression induced Notch-1 activation and was regulated by Wnt-1 activation. The expression of each signaling molecule induced an increase in VEGF expression that was greater in hypoxia with AA than in hypoxia alone. The inhibition of VEGF expression using VEGF-targeted small interfering RNA decreased the hypoxia-induced increase in cell cycle regulatory protein expression, DNA synthesis, and cell number, suggesting that hypoxia-induced VEGF expression stimulates proliferation of mouse ES cells.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

For intestines perfused with [gamma-32P] ATP in which the gamma-32P is easily liberated by alkaline phosphatase, 1,25( OH )2D3 infusion resulted in a significant and early (15 min) increase in net lumen-to-vein 32Pi transport. Pretreatment of rats with levamisole, an inhibitor of alkaline phosphatase, partially inhibited such 32Pi transport. For intestines infused with [alpha-32P] ATP, the lumen-to-vein transport of 32Pi did not differ in 1,25( OH )2D3-treated and in control intestines.

Mechanisms were studied initially to develop an in vitro safety test for detecting pertussis toxin toxicity in acellular pertussis vaccines based on the histamine sensitisation test. Maximal contractions and sensitivities to different agonists and adrenoceptor-induced contractions in Ca2+-free medium of isolated rat small mesenteric resistance arteries were significantly reduced by in vivo [30 microg/kg, intravenously (i.v. ), day 5] or in vitro (10 microg/ml, 2 h) pertussis toxin pretreatment. Pertussis toxin-induced decrease in sensitivity of small mesenteric resistance arteries to noradrenaline was endothelium-dependent. Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (100 microM, 20 min) did not reestablish the sensitivity to noradrenaline. In vivo L-NAME treatment (0, 1, 10 or 30 mg/kg) of pertussis toxin -pretreated (15 microg/kg) rats did not reduce pertussis toxin -induced enhancement of the histamine -induced decrease in blood pressure and histamine (10, 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg) induced mortality.

Megakaryocytes (MKs), the precursor cells for platelets, migrate from the endosteal niche of the bone marrow (BM) toward the vasculature, extending proplatelets into sinusoids, where circulating blood progressively fragments them into platelets. Nonmuscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) heavy chain gene (MYH9) mutations cause macrothrombocytopenia characterized by fewer platelets with larger sizes leading to clotting disorders termed myosin-9-related disorders ( MYH9-RD s). MYH9-RD patient MKs have proplatelets with thicker and fewer branches that produce fewer and larger proplatelets, which is phenocopied in mouse Myh9-RD models. Defective proplatelet formation is considered to be the principal mechanism underlying the macrothrombocytopenia phenotype. However, MYH9-RD patient MKs may have other defects, as NMII interactions with actin filaments regulate physiological processes such as chemotaxis, cell migration, and adhesion. How MYH9-RD mutations affect MK migration and adhesion in BM or NMIIA activity and assembly prior to proplatelet production remain unanswered. NMIIA is the only NMII isoform expressed in mature MKs, permitting exploration of these questions without complicating effects of other NMII isoforms. Using mouse models of MYH9-RD (NMIIAR702C+/-GFP+/-, NMIIAD1424N+/-, and NMIIAE1841K+/-) and in vitro assays, we investigated MK distribution in BM, chemotaxis toward stromal-derived factor 1, NMIIA activity, and bipolar filament assembly. Results indicate that different MYH9-RD mutations suppressed MK migration in the BM without compromising bipolar filament formation but led to divergent adhesion phenotypes and NMIIA contractile activities depending on the mutation.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Tendinopathy is characterized histopathologically by lipid accumulation and tissue calcification. Adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation of tendon stem cells (TSCs) are believed to play key roles in these processes. The major inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) has been shown to induce osteogenic differentiation of TSCs via bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), and BMP-2 has also been implicated in adipogenic differentiation of stem cells. We therefore examined the mechanisms responsible for PGE2 -induced adipogenesis in rat TSCs in vitro. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) mRNA and protein were significantly up-regulated in PGE2 -stimulated TSCs, measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Incubation with specific inhibitors of cAMP, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein- (CEBP) demonstrated that IGF-1 up-regulation occurred via a cAMP/PKA/CEBP pathway. Furthermore, neither IGF-1 nor BMP-2 alone was able to mediate adipogenic differentiation of TSCs, but IGF-1 together with BMP-2 significantly increased adipogenesis, indicated by Oil Red O staining. Moreover, knock-down of endogenous IGF-1 and BMP2 abolished PGE2 -induced adipogenic differentiation. Phosphorylation of CREB and Smad by IGF-1 and BMP-2, respectively, were required for induction of the adipogenesis-related peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 2 (PPAR2) gene and for adipogenic differentiation.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

In newborn rats, antenatal thyroid stimulation with thyroid-releasing hormone is associated with developmental decreases in pulmonary antioxidant enzyme activities and decreased survival rates during prolonged hyperoxic exposure, with pathologic evidence of increased O2-induced lung damage. Propylthiouracil ( PTU ), in addition to its antithyroid effects, reportedly has antioxidant properties. To explore possible pulmonary protective effects from both the antithyroid and antioxidant properties of PTU, we administered PTU (0.015%) in drinking water to timed-pregnant rats for the final 10 d of gestation and during lactation; control rats received untreated water. The survival rate of the PTU -treated pups when placed in more than 95% O2 at birth was consistently higher at all time periods in hyperoxia from 6 d [ PTU, 81 of 81 (100%); control pups, 70 of 84 (83%); p  0.01] to 14 d [ PTU, 41 of 53 (77%); control pups = 14 of 56 (25%); p  0.01]. Further evidence of increased tolerance to more than 95% O2 in PTU pups included a significant decrease in the incidence of microscopic intraalveolar edema, decreased lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde), and a significant increase in lung tissue surfactant-related phospholipids compared with O2-exposed control pups.

Animals were fed for 6 days nutritionally adequate Portagen liquid diet (1 kcal/ml) or isocaloric alcoholic diet containing 5% (w/v) ethanol (36% of total calories) in order to induce the cytochrome P-4502E1 monooxygenase. Dye compounds were administered intraperitoneally 30 h before the test at doses: 90 mg/kg of Acid Green 16 and 70 mg/kg of Basic Orange 28. Bone marrow micronucleus test was used for evaluation of genotoxicity of the dyes. Ethanol caused an increase of the level of cytochrome P-450 by 200% and activities of 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase (ECOD) by 650%, 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) by 460% and glutathione (GSH)-S-transferase by 60% in the liver.

Postaggregation Dictyostelium discoideum cells contain 3000 mRNA species that are absent from preaggregation cells; these aggregation-dependent sequences comprise 30% of the mass of mRNA in these cells. We show that the synthesis and stability of these regulated mRNA sequences are affected by both cell--cell contact and cAMP. Three independent assays are used to quantitate these mRNAs: in vitro translation followed by two-dimensional gel analysis of the protein products; hybridization of gel-separated RNAs to cloned DNAs; and hybridization of mRNA to a cDNA probe specific for the population of regulated sequences. In postaggregation cells, the half-life of both the developmentally regulated mRNAs and the constitutive mRNAs present throughout growth and differentiation is the same--about 4 hr. Following disaggregation, all of the late mRNA sequences are degraded and decay with a half-life of 25 to 45 min. The constitutive species are unaffected; 2.5 hr after disaggregation, the ratio of late to constitutive mRNAs is about 6% that of normal plated cells.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play critical roles in tumor progression. However, the role and mechanism underlying CAFs in esophageal cancer ( EC ) remain unclear. In this study, primary CAFs and normal esophageal fibroblasts (NOFs) were isolated and characterized by immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR and western blot. Clinical significance of twist1 in CAFs were evaluated by immunohistochemistry assay. Conditioned medium (CM) was collected from CAFs to evaluate the influence on epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) of EC cells. EC cells were mixed with CAFs and subcutaneously injected into nude mice to assess the in vivo tumor growth. As the result, twist1 was overexpressed in CAFs compared with NOFs and exhibited adverse prognostic significance. In CAFs, twist1 promoted the expression and secretion of CXCL12. In EC cells, activated CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling promoted the EMT process through ERK/AKT - twist1 - MMP1/E-cadherin pathway. In addition, knockdown of twist1 in CAFs also suppressed in vivo tumor growth.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Chronic administration of the hormone relaxin elicits renal vasodilation that is dependent on nitric oxide (NO) in both conscious intact and ovariectomized female rats. Our first objective was to test whether the hormone, when administered to approximate serum concentrations found in midterm pregnant rats, induces renal vasodilation in males. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) increased significantly, on average, by 33 and 49% over baseline, respectively, after 5 days of recombinant human relaxin (rhRLX) administration to 12 conscious male rats by subcutaneous osmotic minipump. There were also significant decreases in hematocrit, plasma osmolality, and sodium concentration. Another objective was to determine whether endogenous endothelin (ET; via the endothelial ET(B) receptor) mediates the NO-dependent renal vasodilation produced by relaxin. rhRLX or vehicle was administered to conscious female rats (n = 9 and 8 rats, respectively). On the fifth day, baseline GFR and ERPF were both increased, on average, by 20-30% in the rats administered rhRLX (P  0.05 vs. vehicle). Next, the specific ET(B)-receptor antagonist RES-701-1 was infused intravenously over 4 h in both groups of rats. In response to RES-701-1, there was a significant decline in both GFR and ERPF in the rats receiving rhRLX such that renal function converged in the two groups of animals.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

In adult skeletal muscles, exogenous ciliary neurotrophic factor ( CNTF ) induces axons and their nerve terminals to sprout. CNTF also regulates the amount of multiple innervation in developing skeletal muscles during synapse elimination, maintaining multiple innervation of muscle fibers. While CNTF may maintain multiple innervation by regulating developmental synapse elimination, it is also possible that CNTF induces the formation of new multiple innervation through a sprouting response. In this study I examined morphologically the effects of CNTF during synapse elimination in the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle. Rat pups received injections of CNTF in one leg and vehicle in the other either early [postnatal day 7 (P7)-P13] or late (P14-P20) in development. The early treatment period corresponds to that time when the pattern of innervation in the EDL is converted from predominantly multiple to single innervation. The late treatment period is at the end of synapse elimination for the EDL but corresponds to the major period of synapse elimination in the levator ani (LA), allowing a comparison of effects on these two muscles from the same animals. On the day after the final injection, EDL muscles were dissected and stained with tetranitroblue tetrazolium and the resulting pattern of innervation was assessed. The present findings indicate that only the early CNTF treatment regulates the level of multiple innervation in the EDL. Moreover, the effect o early CNTF treatment was local, affecting multiple innervation only in the EDL from the CNTF -treated leg. CNTF injected during the late treatment period had no apparent effects on the EDL but had a potent effect on the pattern of innervation in the LA, significantly increasing the level of multiple innervation in this muscle.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Gangliosides, sialic acid-containing glycophospholipids, accumulate in atherosclerotic vessels and appear to regulate the proliferation of various cell types. Furthermore, vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation is associated with the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases. To demonstrate whether gangliosides are able to modulate the VSMC growth, the effect of gangliosides GM1, GM2, and GM3 on cell DNA synthesis and cell number has been examined. Moreover, we investigated possible intracellular mechanisms by which GM1 and GM2 elicit their mitogenic effects. Stimulation of VSMCs with GM1 and GM2 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in DNA synthesis and cell number, whereas GM3 caused a decrease in DNA synthesis. GM1 and GM2 (50 micromol/L) stimulate phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2 and phosphorylation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), with a maximum at 15 minutes, but they do not have an effect on the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). GM3 (50 micromol/L), on the other hand, does not stimulate any of the 3 aforementioned MAPKs. Pretreatment of the cells with 20 micromol/L PD 098,059 caused a complete inhibition of ERK1/2 and JNK MAPK, whereas pretreatment with a Ras (farnesyl transferase) inhibitor did not abrogate the GM1- and GM2 -induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, GM1 and GM2 did not activate Raf-1 kinase.

Astrocytes perform several functions in the brain and spinal cord. Penicillin is commonly used for establishment of experimental epilepsy models. Previous studies have demonstrated that astragaloside IV (3-o--d-xylopyranosyl-6-o--d-glucopyranosyl-cycloastragenol; ASIV ) has comprehensive pharmacological functions on the attenuation of inflammation. In the present study, primary astrocyte cell cultures were divided into three groups: Control group, penicillin (2,500 M) treatment group (epilepsy model), and penicillin+ ASIV (20, 40, 80 and 160 mol/l) treatment group. The expression levels of inflammatory factors, including interleukin1 and tumor necrosis factor, were determined in the groups using western blot and reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses. The levels of members of the phosphorylatedmitogenactivated protein kinase (p MAPK ) family, including pcJun Nterminal kinase 1/2, pextracellular signalregulated protein kinase 1/2 and pp38, were determined using western blot analysis. Cell viability of the astrocytes was detected using a 3(4,5dimethyl2thiazolyl)2,5diphenyl2Htetrazolium bromide assay and cell proliferation was evaluated using a Cell Counting Kit8 assay. The results revealed that ASIV significantly suppressed the expression of penicillininduced inflammatory factors in the astrocytes at the transcriptional and translational levels, and occurred in a dosedependent manner. The penicillininduced increase in the protein levels of the the p MAPK family were notably decreased by ASIV. In addition, the penicillininduced downregulation of primary astrocyte viability/cell proliferation was significantly reversed by the administration of ASIV.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Aberrant expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) in macrophages, which has been reported to be suppressed by melatonin, has an important contribution in the development of pathological inflammation. Visfatin, an adipokine, regulates the expression of various inflammatory factors, leading to inflammation; however, the influence of visfatin on iNOS -driven processes in macrophages is unclear. Here, we report the assessment of the role of visfatin in the regulation of iNOS gene expression in macrophages. Our data show that the levels of iNOS protein in peritoneal macrophages as well as nitric oxide (NO) in blood plasma were significantly lower after lipopolysaccharide treatment in visfatin(+/-) mice than those in the WT mice. In addition, visfatin increases iNOS mRNA and protein levels in RAW 264.7 cells, along with increasing production of NO. The enhancement of iNOS expression was prevented by treating the cells with inhibitors of the Janus kinase 2/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (JAK2/ STAT3 ), nuclear factor (NF)-B, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathways. Our results also show that visfatin-induced iNOS expression and NO production were significantly inhibited by melatonin, an effect that was closely associated with a reduction in phosphorylated JAK2/ STAT3 levels and with the inhibition of p65 translocation into nucleus.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

It has been experimentally shown that endotoxin induces a significant increase in the blood levels of a plasminogen activator inhibitor ( PAI ). We evaluated the effect of different doses of heparin (5 to 20 IU kg-1 h-1), antithrombin III (10 to 40 U kg-1 h-1 and 240 U/kg as bolus) and of a combination of the two on: 1) the elevation of PAI activity, 2) fibrin deposition in kidneys and 3) mortality in rabbits infused with E. coli lipopolysaccharide. Our results show that heparin plus AT III is able to significantly reduce the generation of endotoxin -induced PAI activity in rabbits' circulation. Low dose of heparin and a bolus injection of AT III both cause a decrease in the generation of PAI at 2 but not at 6 hours of endotoxin infusion. Moreover, fibrin deposits in kidneys of animals receiving heparin plus AT III or a bolus injection of AT III were significantly reduced as compared to control rabbits. The association between low levels of PAI and decreased fibrin deposits is strengthened by the significant correlation (p less than 0.05) found between these two parameters. Finally, the plasma levels of PAI activity at 2 and 6 hours of endotoxin infusion in surviving animals were lower than those observed in animals that died within 2 hours after the end of treatment.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Urea has a critical role in urinary concentration. Mice lacking the inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) urea transporter A1 (UT-A1) and urea transporter A3 (UT-A3) have very low levels of urea permeability and are unable to concentrate urine. To investigate the role of UT-A1 in the concentration of urine, we transgenically expressed UT-A1 in knockout mice lacking UT-A1 and UT-A3 using a construct with a UT-A1 gene that cannot be spliced to produce UT-A3. This construct was inserted behind the original UT-A promoter to yield a mouse expressing only UT-A1 (UT-A1(+/+)/UT-A3(-/-)). Western blot analysis demonstrated UT-A1 in the inner medulla of UT-A1(+/+)/UT-A3(-/-) and wild-type mice, but not in UT-A1/UT-A3 knockout mice, and an absence of UT-A3 in UT-A1(+/+)/UT-A3(-/-) and UT-A1/UT-A3 knockout mice. Immunohistochemistry in UT-A1(+/+)/UT-A3(-/-) mice also showed negative UT-A3 staining in kidney and other tissues and positive UT-A1 staining only in the IMCD. Urea permeability in isolated perfused IMCDs showed basal permeability in the UT-A1(+/+)/UT-A3(-/-) mice was similar to levels in wild-type mice, but vasopressin stimulation of urea permeability in wild-type mice was significantly greater (100% increase) than in UT-A1(+/+)/UT-A3(-/-) mice (8% increase).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The observed increases in pCO2 and the decreases in cerebral vascular resistance during 5% CO2 inhalation were unchanged 1 hr after administration of an i.v. bolus of 0.1 M Na2CO3 (vehicle). In another group of five dogs, 5% CO2 increased pCO2 from 30.4 +/- 0.58 to 55.2 +/- 4.2 mm Hg (P less than.01) and decreased total cerebral vascular resistance from 5.7 +/- 0.6 to 1.8 +/- 0.4 mm Hg. min. 100g. ml-1 (P less than.001).

Growing in vitro evidence suggests NHE-1, a known target for reactive oxygen species (ROS), as a key mediator in cardiac hypertrophy ( CH ). Moreover, NHE-1 inhibition was shown effective in preventing CH and failure; so has been the case for AT1 receptor (AT1R) blockers. Previous experiments indicate that myocardial stretch promotes angiotensin II release and post-translational NHE-1 activation; however, in vivo data supporting this mechanism and its long-term consequences are scanty. In this work, we thought of providing in vivo evidence linking AT1R with ROS and NHE-1 activation in mediating CH. CH was induced in mice by TAC. A group of animals was treated with the AT1R blocker losartan. Cardiac contractility was assessed by echocardiography and pressure-volume loop hemodynamics. After 7 weeks, TAC increased left ventricular (LV) mass by 45% vs. sham and deteriorated LV systolic function. CH was accompanied by activation of the redox-sensitive kinase p90(RSK) with the consequent increase in NHE-1 phosphorylation. Losartan prevented p90(RSK) and NHE-1 phosphorylation, ameliorated CH and restored cardiac function despite decreased LV wall thickness and similar LV systolic pressures and diastolic dimensions (increased LV wall stress).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Tenofovir disoproxil fumerate ( TDF ) is an effective nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for HIV infection but it is potentially nephrotoxic. A selective mithochondrial toxicity has been hypothesized. To assess early markers of renal toxicity, we evaluated a cohort of antiretroviral (ARV)-experienced HIV patients who had been switched from a thymidinic backbone to either a TDF /emtricitabine regimen ( TDF ; 73 patients) or an abacavir/lamivudine (ABV) regimen (28 patients). Markers of mitochondrial toxicity (cytochrome c, Cyc) or cytosolic (-glutathione S transferase, -GST) together with common indicators of renal damage were assessed at baseline (T0) and after 1 (T1), 3 (T2), 6 (T3), and 12 (T4) months of patient exposure to therapy. Clinical features of both groups were comparable at T0. There was no significant variation in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGRF), median urine protein excretion, or microalbuminuria and serum phosphate levels in both groups during the study period. There was a significant increase in urinary excretion of phosphate in patients on TDF compared to those on ABV at T3 and T4. Fractional excretion of uric acid was also altered in the two treatment groups; there was no change in the ABV (constantly less than 0.10), but a progressive increase in TDF patients.

1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-( OH )2D3) has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of lymphocyte proliferation in vitro. The present study was undertaken to determine if this is caused by a direct effect on the lymphocytes, and to evaluate to what degree this suppression may be restored by the addition of cytokines. 1,25-( OH )2D3, > or = 10(-10) M, significantly inhibited the proliferation of pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-driven human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC). Depletion of monocytes did not alter the response to 1,25-( OH )2D3. The antiproliferative effect was preceded by decreased production of interleukin (IL)-1 alpha and lymphotoxin (LT), both of which are crucially involved in T cell activation. However, the suppressive effect of 1,25-( OH )2D3, seen in MNC cultures stimulated with PWM alone, was of the same magnitude as the effect seen in MNC cultures stimulated with a combination of PWM and recombinant (r)IL-1 alpha, rIL-6, recombinant tumour necrosis factor (rTNF) alpha, rIL-2 or rLT, as well as PWM plus conditioned medium. Although pretreatment of monocytes for 2 h with 1,25-( OH )2D3 caused significant reduction in the release of IL-1 alpha and TNF alpha, reconstitution of monocyte-depleted cultures with similarly treated monocytes had no inhibitory effect on the proliferative response.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Quercetin (QE), a natural flavonoid, has many medical beneficial effects. However, its protective effects against carbon tetrachloride ( CCl4 ) induced injury in liver have not been clarified. The aim of the present study is to illustrate the effects of QE on hepatic oxidative injury and inflammation in mice exposed to CCl4. ICR (Institute of Cancer Research) mice were exposed to CCl4 with or without QE co-administration for one week. Our results showed that QE administration significantly inhibited CCl4 -induced liver injury. One of the potential mechanisms of QE action was decreasing the oxidative stress, which is consistent with decreasing of lipid peroxidation level and increasing the antioxidant enzyme activities in livers of mice. Furthermore, QE significantly decreased cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) expression and production of pro-inflammatory markers such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin-1 (IL-1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and nitric oxide (NO) in livers of CCl4 -treated mouse. In the process of exploring the underlying mechanisms of QE action, we found that QE significantly inhibited the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation, which in turn inactivated NF-B and the inflammatory cytokines in livers of the CCl4 -treated mice.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

DIDS, NPPB, tannic acid (TA) and AO1 are widely used inhibitors of Cl (-) channels. Some Cl (-) channel inhibitors (NPPB, DIDS, niflumic acid) were shown to affect phosphatidylserine ( PS ) scrambling and, thus, the life span of human red blood cells (hRBCs). Since a number of publications suggest Ca(2+) dependence of PS scrambling, we explored whether inhibitors of Cl (-) channels (DIDS, NPPB) or of Ca(2+)-activated Cl (-) channels (DIDS, NPPB, TA, AO1) modified intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) and activity of Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (Gardos) channel in hRBCs. According to Fluo-3 fluorescence in flow cytometry, a short treatment (15 min, +37 °C) with Cl (-) channels inhibitors decreased [Ca(2+)]i in the following order: TA > AO1 > DIDS > NPPB. According to forward scatter, the decrease of [Ca(2+)]i was accompanied by a slight but significant increase in cell volume following DIDS, NPPB and AO1 treatments. TA treatment resulted in cell shrinkage. According to whole-cell patch-clamp experiments, TA activated and NPPB and AO1 inhibited Gardos channels. The Cl (-) channel blockers further modified the alterations of [Ca(2+)]i following ATP depletion (glucose deprivation, iodoacetic acid, 6-inosine), oxidative stress (1 mM t-BHP) and treatment with Ca(2+) ionophore ionomycin (1 M).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) are pluripotent cells that have the capacity to differentiate into tendon fibroblasts (TFs). They are abundant in adults, easy to access, and are therefore an ideal cell source for tendon tissue engineering. Despite this potential, the molecular cues necessary for tenogenic differentiation of ASCs are unknown. Unlike other bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), BMP12, BMP13, and BMP14 have been reported to be less osteo-chondrogenic and to induce tendon rather than bone formation in vivo. This study investigated the effects of BMP12 and BMP14 on ASC differentiation in vitro. In canine ASCs, BMP12 effectively increased the expression of the tendon markers scleraxis and tenomodulin at both mRNA and protein levels. Consistent with these results, BMP12 induced scleraxis promoter driven-GFP and tenomodulin protein expression in mouse ASCs. Although BMP12 also enhanced the expression of the cartilage matrix gene aggrecan in ASCs, the resulting levels remained considerably lower than those detected in tendon fibroblasts. In addition, BMP12 reduced expression of the bone marker osteocalcin, but not the osteogenic transcription factor runx-2. BMP14 exhibited similar, but marginally less potent and selective effects, compared to BMP12. BMPs are known to signal through the canonical Smad pathway and the non-canonical mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. BMP12 triggered robust phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 but not Smad2/3 or p38 MAPK in ASCs. The effect was likely conveyed by type I receptors ALK2/3/6, as phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 was blocked by the ALK2/3/6 inhibitor LDN-193189 but not by the ALK4/5/7 inhibitor SB-505124.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene is activated by multiple extracellular signals in a stimulus- and cell type-specific fashion. Based on the presence of kappaB-like DNA motifs in the region upstream of the TNF gene, some have proposed a direct role for NF-kappaB in lipopolysaccharide ( LPS )-induced TNF gene transcription in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. However, we have previously demonstrated a general and critical role for a minimal TNF promoter region bearing only one of the kappaB-like motifs, kappa3, which is bound by nuclear factor of activated T cell proteins in lymphocytes and fibroblasts in response to multiple stimuli and Ets proteins in LPS -stimulated macrophages. Here, in an effort to resolve these contrasting findings, we used a combination of site-directed mutagenesis of the TNF promoter, quantitative DNase I footprinting, and analysis of endogenous TNF mRNA production in response to multiple stimuli under conditions that inhibit NF-kappaB activation (using the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin and using cells lacking either functional NF-kappaB essential modulator, which is the IkappaB kinase regulatory subunit, or the Nemo gene itself). We find that TNF mRNA production in response to ionophore is NF-kappaB-independent, but inhibition of NF-kappaB activation attenuates virus- and LPS -induced TNF mRNA levels after initial induction.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
We conclude that induction of <re> TNF gene transcription <er> by virus or <el> LPS <le> does not depend upon NF-kappaB binding to the proximal promoter; rather, a stimulus-specific post-induction mechanism involving NF-kappaB, yet to be characterized, is involved in the maintenance of maximal TNF mRNA levels. positive----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

We have investigated the role of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AHR ) in the regulation of the Cyp2a5 gene. The C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mouse strains with a genetically determined difference in AHR function were used to study the CYP2A5 induction by typical AHR ligands, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and 3-methylcholanthrene. The CYP2A5 mRNA up-regulation in these mouse strains showed a difference in response, typical for AHR -regulated genes, both by TCDD in cultured primary hepatocytes and by 3-methylcholanthrene in vivo. In primary hepatocytes, TCDD caused a 3-fold elevation of the CYP2A5 protein level and a similar induction of the CYP2A5-catalyzed coumarin 7-hydroxylation activity. In reporter gene assays, the Cyp2a5 promoter region -3033 to +10 mediated a 2- to 5-fold induction of luciferase activity by TCDD treatment in primary hepatocytes and in Hepa-1 hepatoma cells with an intact AHR / AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT) complex. In Hepa-1 variant cell lines with deficiencies in the AHR /ARNT complex, the absence of ARNT abolished the induction. A putative AHR response element (XRE) was identified in the Cyp2a5 promoter at the position -2514 to -2492 and found to interact with the AHR /ARNT heterodimer. Transfection experiments combined with mutation of the XRE site indicated that the site partly mediates the TCDD induction of Cyp2a5. An additional AHR -dependent mechanism also regulates the proximal promoter of the Cyp2a5 gene.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We have tested the hypothesis that interconversion between multiple glucose-6-P-dependent forms of glycogen synthase helps regulate glycogen synthesis in adipose tissue. Our results indicate that interconversion of glycogen synthase in adipose tissue involves primarily dependent forms and that these interconversions were measured better by monitoring the activation constant (A0.5) for glucose-6-P than measuring the -: + glucose-6-P activity ratio. Insulin decreased and epinephrine increased the A0.5 for glucose-6-P without significant change in the activity ratio. Insulin consistently decreased the A0.5 in either the presence or absence of glucose, indicating that the insulin-promoted interconversion did not require increased hexose transport. Isoproterenol increased the A0.5 for glucose-6-P, while methoxamine was without effect, indicating beta receptors mediate adrenergic control of interconversion between glucose-6-P-dependent forms. The changes in the A0.5 produced by incubations with insulin or epinephrine were mutually reversible.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Human basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) is a potent neuroprotective agent. The clinical efficacy of this neurotrophin, however, is restricted by poor permeability across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This study was designed to test the hypotheses that bFGF will retain its biological activity and have an enhanced BBB transport after re-formulation and conjugation to a BBB peptide drug delivery vector. The BBB delivery vector is comprised of a conjugate of streptavidin (SA) and the murine OX26 monoclonal antibody against the rat transferrin receptor, and the conjugate of biotinylated bFGF ( bio- bFGF ) bound to a vector is designated bio- bFGF /OX26-SA. A radioreceptor binding assay shows that the native bFGF, bio- bFGF, and bio- bFGF /OX26-SA conjugate have IC50 values of 0.12, 0.40, and 0.56 nM, respectively. After an IV bolus injection to the rat, [125I]- bio- bFGF is avidly taken up by peripheral organs, with low brain uptake at 60 min, 0.010+/-0.004% of injected dose (ID)/g brain. By contrast, the brain uptake of the [125I]- bio- bFGF /OX26-SA is increased 5-fold to 0.050+/-0.011%ID/g, although the uptake of the conjugate by peripheral tissues was decreased relative to the unconjugated bio- bFGF.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The natural sweetener stevioside, which is found in the plant Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni, has been used for many years in the treatment of diabetes among Indians in Paraguay and Brazil. However, the mechanism for the blood glucose-lowering effect remains unknown. To elucidate the impact of stevioside and its aglucon steviol on insulin release from normal mouse islets and the beta-cell line INS-1 were used. Both stevioside and steviol (1 nmol/L to 1 mmol/L) dose-dependently enhanced insulin secretion from incubated mouse islets in the presence of 16.7 mmol/L glucose (P .05). The insulinotropic effects of stevioside and steviol were critically dependent on the prevailing glucose concentration, ie, stevioside (1 mmol/L) and steviol (1 micromol/L) only potentiated insulin secretion at or above 8.3 mmol/L glucose (P .05). Interestingly, the insulinotropic effects of both stevioside and steviol were preserved in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. During perifusion of islets, stevioside (1 mmol/L) and steviol (1 micromol/L) had a long-lasting and apparently reversible insulinotropic effect in the presence of 16.7 mmol/L glucose (P .05). To determine if stevioside and steviol act directly on beta cells, the effects on INS-1 cells were also investigated.

The aims of this study were: 1) to describe, in relation to the date of final menses, the average hormone levels of women in the years before and after this date and to determine the extent to which these average levels were dependent on age and body mass index (BMI); and 2) to determine the degree of tracking in residual hormone levels [i.e., the extent to which individuals above (below) the mean for their age or time relative to final menstrual period ( FMP ) and BMI remain above (below) the mean as time progresses]. Serial levels of serum FSH, circulating estradiol ( E2 ), and the dimeric inhibins (INH) A and B were measured annually in 150 women who experienced a natural menopause during 6 years of follow-up. Means of the log-transformed hormonal levels were analyzed as a double-logistic function of time relative to FMP, as well as age and BMI and correlations between repeated hormonal levels, were measured. Mean FSH levels started to increase from about 2 years before the FMP, increased most rapidly about 10 months before the FMP, and had virtually plateaued by 2 years after the FMP. FSH levels were, on average, 3% greater for each year of age and 2% lower for each kg/m2 of BMI. After adjusting for time relative to the FMP, logFSH showed modest tracking. Age-adjusted values of logFSH were moderately correlated across time, and much of this tracking was explained by the actual timing of a woman's FMP. Mean E2 levels started to decrease about 2 years before the FMP, decreased most rapidly around the time of the FMP, and had virtually plateaued by 2 years after the FMP. E2 levels were lower, on average, by about 9% per year of age, and residual values showed weak tracking.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Among the nonsteroid antiinflammatory drugs there is generally a close correlation between the potency of their inhibition of arachidonate cyclooxygenase, and thus prostaglandin production, and their antiinflammatory activity. One anomaly in this generalization is that whereas aspirin and salicylate are equipotent as antiinflammatory agents, salicylate is less active than aspirin in inhibiting prostaglandin production in vitro. Using rats, we have now measured the concentrations of aspirin and salicylate in plasma and in inflammatory exudates after their oral administration and determined their effects on thromboxane B2 production in clotting blood and prostaglandin (PG) E2 concentrations in the exudates. We have also investigated the effects of both drugs, at concentrations achieved in the exudates, on PGE2 production by nonproliferative explants of acutely inflamed tissues. Aspirin is rapidly metabolized, resulting in peak concentrations of salicylate in the plasma and exudate that exceeded peak concentrations of aspirin by 30- to 50-fold. Furthermore, concentrations of aspirin rapidly declined, whereas high concentrations of salicylate persisted in the plasma and in the exudate for up to 6 hr after a single administration of aspirin. Both drugs reduced PGE2 concentrations in inflammatory exudates by 50-70%, but aspirin was considerably more potent than salicylate in inhibiting thromboxane B2 production in clotting blood. The concentration of salicylate found in inflammatory exudates 6 hr after the administration of aspirin was sufficient to reduce PGE2 production in explants by more than 50%.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Oxaliplatin resistance limits its effectiveness in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Abnormal activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway has been associated with decreased survival of HCC patients, anti-apoptosis after chemotherapeutic drug-induced DNA damage, and chemoresistance. In this research, we evaluated the effect of the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, PKI-587, on the sensitivity of oxaliplatin in HCC. Two HCC cell lines (HepG2 and SK-Hep1) were used to analyze PKI-587 for DNA damage response, cell proliferation, clonogenic survival, cell cycle and apoptosis after oxaliplatin treatment. A HepG2 tumor-bearing model was used to assess the in vivo effects of the combination of the two compounds. In HCC cells, oxaliplatin stably activated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, including up-regulation of p-Akt (Ser473), p-mTOR (Ser2448), p-mTOR (Ser2481), p-elF4EBP1, and p-S6K1, and activated the DNA damage repair pathways (non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR)), up-regulation of p-DNAPKcs (Ser2056), p-ATM (Ser1981), and p-ATR (Ser428), which were attenuated by PKI-587. Compared with oxaliplatin alone, the combination of PKI-587 and oxaliplatin increased the number of -H2AX/cells, decreased proliferation of cells, and an increased the percentage of G0/G1 phase cells and apoptotic cells.

Interferon-gamma ( IFNgamma ) is an immunomodulating cytokine that has profound effects on reproductive function. IFNgamma inhibits steroidogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. The mechanism by which IFNgamma inhibits Leydig cell steroidogenesis remains unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of IFNgamma on the expression and regulation of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) gene in primary cultures of rat Leydig cells. StAR facilitates the efficient production of steroid hormone by regulating the translocation of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, the site of the cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage (P450scc) enzyme system that converts cholesterol to pregnenolone. IFNgamma inhibited hCG-induced StAR messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in a dose-dependent manner. The addition of IFNgamma in a concentration of 500 U/ml decreased hCG-induced 3.8- and 1.7-kilobase StAR mRNA by 78% and 70%, respectively. IFNgamma also reduced hCG-stimulated P450scc mRNA levels by 69%. The inhibitory effects of IFNgamma on StAR mRNA levels were confirmed by ribonuclease protection assay. As early as 12 h after the addition of IFNgamma, hCG-induced StAR mRNA levels decreased by more than 44%. To evaluate the effects of IFNgamma on StAR protein levels, Western blot analyses were performed. hCG in a concentration of 10 ng/ml increased StAR protein by 5.6-fold.

Early pulmonary inflammation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) play important roles during lung fibrosis. Increasing evidence demonstrates that calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D3, has anti-inflammatory activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of calcitriol on bleomycin ( BLM )-induced early pulmonary inflammation and subsequent EMT. Mice were intratracheally injected with BLM (3.0mg/kg). In three calcitriol+ BLM groups, mice were intraperitoneal (i.p.) injected with different doses of calcitriol (0.2, 1.0 or 5.0 g/kg) daily, beginning at 48 h before BLM injection. Twenty-four hours, seven and fourteen days after BLM injection, pulmonary inflammation and EMT were evaluated. As expected, BLM -induced infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lungs was attenuated by calcitriol. BLM -induced pulmonary inflammatory cytokines were repressed by calcitriol. Moreover, BLM -induced nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) p65 was blocked by calcitriol. In addition, BLM -induced phosphorylation of pulmonary p38 MAPK and protein kinase B (Akt) was inhibited by calcitriol.

Accumulation of misfolded proinsulin in the -cell leads to dysfunction induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, with diabetes as a consequence. Autophagy helps cellular adaptation to stress via clearance of misfolded proteins and damaged organelles. We studied the effects of proinsulin misfolding on autophagy and the impact of stimulating autophagy on diabetes progression in Akita mice, which carry a mutation in proinsulin, leading to its severe misfolding. Treatment of female diabetic Akita mice with rapamycin improved diabetes, increased pancreatic insulin content, and prevented -cell apoptosis. In vitro, autophagic flux was increased in Akita -cells. Treatment with rapamycin further stimulated autophagy, evidenced by increased autophagosome formation and enhancement of autophagosome-lysosome fusion. This was associated with attenuation of cellular stress and apoptosis. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase inhibitor Torin1 mimicked the rapamycin effects on autophagy and stress, indicating that the beneficial effects of rapamycin are indeed mediated via inhibition of mTOR.

The HIV-1 Nef protein plays a critical role in viral pathogenesis. Nef has been shown to modulate dendritic cell (DC) function, in particular perturbing their ability to present Ag. To further characterize the effects of Nef on DCs, we established a panel of transfectants of the murine DC line, DC2.4, stably expressing differing levels of either wild-type Nef, or a number of Nef mutants lacking key functional motifs. Transfectants expressing increasing levels of wild-type Nef demonstrated a dose-dependent shrinkage and loss of dendrites. Nef expression levels also correlated with increased proliferative ability but did not confer resistance to proapoptotic stimuli. Importantly, Nef expression resulted in an impairment of Ag presentation to T cells correlating with a reduction in the cell surface expression of molecules involved in Ag presentation such as MHC class I, CD80/86, and ICAM-1. Nef expression also rendered DC2.4 cells resistant to the maturation stimulus provided by an anti-CD40 Ab. Mutations in either the myristoylation site or Src homology 3-domain binding polyproline motif of Nef abolished these effects. Previous studies had shown that these mutations also abolished the ability of Nef to activate the p21-activated kinase, PAK2.

To explore the mechanisms of MDSC trafficking and accumulation during tumor progression. In this study, we report significant CD40 upregulation in tumor-infiltrating MDSC when compared with splenic MDSC.

We increased the specific binding to NMDA receptor s in the cerebral cortex, from 2.2 +/- 0.9 to 4.5 +/- 0.8 (density units) in male Long-Evans rats by daily giving two intraperiotoneal injections (30 mg/kg) of CGS-19755, an NMDA receptor inhibitor, for 7 consecutive days (discontinued for 20 h before experiment). Twelve up-regulated (CGS treated) and 12 control rats were used in this study. Under isoflurane anesthesia and after topical stimulation of the right cerebral cortex with 10(-2) M NMDA, the blood flow (14C-iodoantipyrine method) increased from 98 +/- 11 ml/min/100 g in the unstimulated cortex of the control rats to 161 +/- 37 ml/min/100 g in the stimulated cortex. The unstimulated value for blood flow (95 +/- 7 ml/min/100 g) did not change in the upregulated group but it doubled (194 +/- 69 ml/min/100 g) in the stimulated, upregulated cortex. Similarly, O2 consumption (cryomicrospectrophotometrically determined) in normal rats increased 46%, from 9.3 +/- 1 ml/min/100 g to 13.6 +/- 4 after NMDA stimulation. While in the upregulated animals, O2 consumption increased 103% from 7.9 +/- 0.6 to 16 +/- 6.5 after NMDA stimulation.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
In conclusion, <el> <re> NMDA <er> receptor <le> upregulation does not alter basal cerebrocortical blood flow or O2 consumption but in the <re> NMDA <er>-stimulated cortex, the blood flow and O2 consumption increase is dependent on the number of <el> <re> NMDA <er> receptor <le>s present. positive----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

1. The xanthine-dehydrogenase activity of chick liver, expressed per mg. of nitrogen, is increased during starvation. 2. Administration of inosine and possibly of adenine has a comparable effect on the xanthine dehydrogenase, and also induces an elevation of the total quantity of enzyme. Hypoxanthine, xanthine, guanine, xanthosine, guanosine and adenosine are ineffective. Cortisone is equally ineffective. 3.

Serotoninergic transmission is implicated in the photic and non-photic regulation of circadian rhythm s. 5-HT (1-100 microM), carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT 0.1-10 microM) and (+)-8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetraline (8-OH-DPAT, 1-30 microM) dose-dependently activated an outward current (5-100 pA) in 30% of neurons voltage-clamped at -60 mV in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in vitro slice. EC(50) values were 7.0 microM for 5-HT and 0.2 microM for 5-CT. Serotonin-induced outward current was associated with an increase in input conductance, and the current was blocked by Ba(2+) (1 mM). The amplitude of the current was enhanced by depolarization, reduced by hyperpolarization, and reversed its polarity during a hyperpolarization beyond the potassium equilibrium potential. Mean amplitudes of the 5-HT outward current changed with time of the subjective circadian day. The value near CT2 (23.8 pA) was about 4 times greater than that around CT14 (6.7 pA). Cells that responded with an outward current showed four types of morphology: monopolar, simple bipolar, curly bipolar and radial shaped; they were localized in all parts of the SCN. The EPSC evoked by retino-hypothalamic-tract (RHT) stimulation was inhibited 26% but the inward current induced by exogenously applied glutamate or NMDA was not affected by serotonin agonists. Focal stimulation-induced and spontaneous IPSC but not the exogenous GABA-induced outward current were inhibited by 5-HT agonists in a subpopulation of cells.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The adrenostatic compound aminoglutethimide ( AG ), a potent inhibitor of the P450 side chain cleavage enzyme, is used in the treatment of ACTH-dependent or adrenal Cushing's syndrome. Recently, AG has been shown to inhibit ACTH receptor ( ACTH-R ) mRNA expression in ovine adrenocortical cells in a time-dependent fashion. To investigate whether ACTH-R down-regulation will also be induced in tumor cells, we studied the effect of AG on ACTH-R expression in the human NCI-h295 adrenocortical carcinoma cell line, which expresses functional ACTH receptors and produces steroids of the glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid and androgen pathway. The cells were incubated in triplicate with increasing doses of AG (3, 30, 300 microM) which suppressed steroid secretion dose-dependently. After 48 h, cells were harvested, and total RNA was extracted, electrophoresed, blotted and hybridized with a human ACTH-R cDNA probe. In parallel experiments, after preincubation with AG the cells were stimulated with ACTH (10 nM) for 10 min and the intracellular cAMP accumulation was determined by RIA. AG significantly suppressed the baseline ACTH-R mRNA expression in a dose-dependent fashion (300 microM AG, 5+/-1%; 30 microM AG, 64+/-1%; 3 microM AG, 108+/-19% compared with control cells, 100+/-11%). The reduced ACTH-R mRNA expression was paralleled by low ACTH-induced cAMP accumulation indicating reduced expression of the ACTH-R protein. The adrenostatic compound metyrapone, an inhibitor of 11beta-hydroxylase activity, also suppressed ACTH-R mRNA expression in a similar fashion.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

This study was undertaken to compare the effects of chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on blood pressure (BP) and renal hemodynamics in older black and nonblack hypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency. A multicenter, placebo lead-in double-blind, parallel group study was performed to compare the antihypertensive efficacy and renal hemodynamic response to the once-daily ACE inhibitor fosinopril (n = 14) and lisinopril (n = 13) over a 22-week period. The study goal was to lower diastolic blood pressure (DBP) to 90 mm Hg or less. Furosemide was added after 6 weeks if blood pressure goal was not achieved. At outpatient clinics at university medical centers, 27 older hypertensive patients (> or = 45 years; 12 blacks, 15 nonblacks; 19 male, eight female) with DBP of 95 mm Hg or higher and 4-hour creatinine clearance 20 to 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 were studied. Changes (delta) from baseline in BP, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and renal plasma flow (RPF) were measured. Mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) and DBP decreased significantly and to a similar extent in randomized groups: fosinopril (mean +/- SEM) delta DBP at 6 weeks was -13 +/- 2 (P  0.0001; 95% CI, -16 to -9) and at 22 weeks was -12 +/- 2 (P  0.0001; 95% CI, -16 to -9); lisinopril delta DBP at 6 weeks was -14 +/- 6 (P  0.0001; 95% CI, -10 to -18) and at 22 weeks was -16 +/- 2 (P  0.0001; 95% CI, -12 to -21).

The in vivo bronchoconstrictor effect of tachykinin s in Fisher 344 rats is accompanied by release into the airways of 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT ). 5-HT is possibly derived from mast cells. In the present study the presumed mast cell- tachykinin interaction was studied in isolated trachea from Fisher 344 rats. Contractions induced by neurokinin A were largely reduced by the 5-HT antagonist methysergide, partially reduced by atropine, but not affected by hexamethonium or tetrodotoxin. Methysergide also inhibited the contractions induced by substance P, the tachykinin NK1 receptor agonist Ac[Arg6, Sar9, Met(O2)11]substance P-(6-11) and the mast cell depleting compound 48/80. Methysergide had no effect on contractions induced by carbachol or electrical field stimulation. Atropine significantly reduced contractions to 5-HT and completely inhibited contractions induced by electrical field stimulation. Histamine had no contractile effect. In vivo pretreatment with compound 48/80 significantly reduced the in vitro contractions to neurokinin A. Contractions to capsaicin were inhibited by methysergide and the tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist (+/-)-RP67580 ((3alphaR,7alphaR)-(7,7-diphenyl-2-(1-imino-2-(2-methoxyp henylethyl)-perhydraisoinotol-4-one))). Substance P and neurokinin A caused 5-HT release in the organ bath, in a concentration- and time-dependent way. Atropine did not affect 5-HT release.

CD44v9 is expressed in cancer stem cells (CSC) and stabilizes the glutamate-cystine transporter xCT on the cytoplasmic membrane, thereby decreasing intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ). This mechanism confers ROS resistance to CSC and CD44v9-expressing cancer cells. The aims of the present study were to assess: (i) expression status of CD44v9 and xCT in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues, including those derived from patients treated with hepatic arterial infusion chemoembolization (HAIC) therapy with cisplatin (CDDP); and (ii) whether combination of CDDP with sulfasalazine (SASP), an inhibitor of xCT, was more effective on tumor cells than CDDP alone by inducing ROS -mediated apoptosis. Twenty non-pretreated HCC tissues and 7 HCC tissues administered HAIC therapy with CDDP before surgical resection were subjected to immunohistochemistry analysis of CD44v9 and xCT expression. Human HCC cell lines HAK-1A and HAK-1B were used in this study; the latter was also used for xenograft experiments in nude mice to assess in vivo efficacy of combination treatment. CD44v9 positivity was significantly higher in HAIC-treated tissues (5/7) than in non-pretreated tissues (2/30), suggesting the involvement of CD44v9 in the resistance to HAIC. xCT was significantly expressed in poorly differentiated HCC tissues.

The effects that granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) has on HIV-1 replication in monocyte-derived macrophage are controversial. We noted that groups reporting that GM-CSF inhibits HIV-1 replication performed their experiments at relatively high cell densities. To address this issue, we performed experiments at different macrophage densities. In cultures seeded at low cell densities, we find that adding GM-CSF during the first week of culture (ie, before infection, during maturation) increased viral replication compared with that in untreated controls in 10 of 11 donors with quantifiable HIV-1 replication. (No effects were observed if GM-CSF was added after the first week of culture.) In cultures seeded at the higher cell densities representative of those in some previous studies, adding GM-CSF during the first week reduced subsequent viral replication in 8 of 12 donors. In all cases in which GM-CSF reduced viral replication, however, the pH in the wells containing GM-CSF -treated cells dropped dramatically. Macrophages in these acidified cultures had numerous dark granules, suggesting that they were under stress.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Neuronal differentiation has evolved as an essential process even in the adult brain, once disturbed being associated with the pathogenesis of several psychiatric disorders. To study the effects of Raf kinase inhibitor protein ( RKIP ) on neuronal differentiation, we generated neuroblastoma cell lines overexpressing RKIP ( RKIP (+)) and expressing RKIP -directed short hairpin RNA for downregulation of RKIP ( RKIP (-)). During a 4-week time course of continuous differentiation by retinoic acid (RA), expression of neuronal and glial markers, intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction to extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK-1/2) and cellular morphology were investigated in relation to RKIP levels. RKIP (+) cells showed accelerated neurite outgrowth, formation of elaborated neuronal networks and increased neuronal marker expression both in RA-induced differentiation and to some extent even in non-RA-treated cells. RKIP (-) cells showed glial-like cell bodies and increased glial fibrillary acidic protein, suggesting a shift from neuronal to glial phenotype. With respect to differentiation-inducing signal pathways, PKC-mediated ERK-1/2 activation significantly correlated with RKIP levels. Furthermore, basal and forskolin-stimulated intracellular cAMP was potently increased in RKIP (+) cells versus controls.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Doxorubicin's ( DOX ) cardiotoxicity contributes to the development of chemotherapy-induced heart failure ( HF ) and new treatment strategies are in high demand.

DOX was administered for two weeks in a cumulative dose of 15 mg/kg. In HanSD rats DOX administration resulted in the development of an early phase of HF with the dominant symptom of bilateral cardiac atrophy demonstrable two weeks after the last DOX injection. In TGR, DOX caused substantial impairment of systolic function already at the end of the treatment, with further progression observed throughout the experiment.

The role of bone morphogenetic protein 4 ( BMP4 ), a crucial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) mediator, in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients heretofore has not been elucidated. The present study analyzed BMP4 expression in tumors and paired non-tumorous liver tissue and its correlation with clinicopathological characteristics from two independent cohorts consisting of 420 HCC patients. Functional analysis of BMP4 was performed in Bel-7402 and HCCLM3 HCC cells, and in a murine HCC model. The downstream targets of BMP4 in HCC were screened and confirmed. The results indicated that BMP4 expression was significantly increased in HCC tissue and highly metastatic HCC cells. BMP4 expression was correlated with vein invasion, overall survival and recurrence-free survival of HCC. BMP4 promoted HCC EMT and metastasis in vitro, and consistently in vivo.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) results from genetic defects in the LDL receptor, and is characterized by a marked elevation in plasma LDL and by qualitative abnormalities in LDL particles. Because LDL particles are major acceptors of cholesteryl esters ( CE s) from HDL, significant changes occur in the flux of CE through the reverse cholesterol pathway. To evaluate the effects of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, pravastatin, on CE transfer from HDL to apo B-containing lipoproteins and on plasma lipoprotein subspecies profile in subjects with heterozygous FH, we investigated the transfer of HDL- CE to LDL subfractions and changes in both concentration and chemical composition of the apo B- and the apo AI-containing lipoproteins. After pravastatin treatment (40 mg/d) for a 12-week period, plasma LDL concentrations (mean +/- SD, 745.4 +/- 51.9 mg/dL) were reduced by 36% in patients with FH (n = 6). By contrast, the qualitative features of the density profile of LDL subspecies in patients with FH, in whom the intermediate (d = 1.029 to 1.039 g/mL) and dense (d = 1.039 to 1.063 g/mL) subspecies were significantly increased relative to a control group, were not modified by pravastatin. In addition, no significant effect on the chemical composition of individual LDL subfractions was observed. Furthermore, plasma HDL concentrations were not modified, although the density distribution of HDL was normalized. Indeed, the HDL density peak was shifted towards the HDL2 subfraction (ratios of HDL2 to HDL3 were 0.7 and 1.1 before and after treatment, respectively). Evaluation of plasma CE transfer protein ( CE TP) mass was performed with an exogenous CE transfer assay. Under these conditions, no modification of plasma CE TP protein mass was induced by pravastatin administration.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The effect of ethanol on the amiloride- and benzamil (Bz)-insensitive salt taste receptor was investigated by the measurement of intracellular Na(+) activity ([Na(+)](i)) in polarized rat fungiform taste receptor cells (TRCs) using fluorescence imaging and by chorda tympani (CT) taste nerve recordings. CT responses were monitored during lingual stimulation with ethanol solutions containing NaCl or KCl. CT responses were recorded in the presence of Bz (a specific blocker of the epithelial Na(+) channel [ENaC]) or the vanilloid receptor-1 (VR-1) antagonists capsazepine or SB-366791, which also block the Bz-insensitive salt taste receptor, a VR-1 variant. CT responses were recorded at 23 degrees C or 42 degrees C (a temperature at which the VR-1 variant salt taste receptor activity is maximally enhanced). In the absence of permeable cations, ethanol induced a transient decrease in TRC volume, and stimulating the tongue with ethanol solutions without added salt elicited only transient phasic CT responses that were insensitive to elevated temperature or SB-366791. Preshrinking TRCs in vivo with hypertonic mannitol (0.5 M) attenuated the magnitude of the phasic CT response, indicating that in the absence of mineral salts, transient phasic CT responses are related to the ethanol -induced osmotic shrinkage of TRCs. In the presence of mineral salts, ethanol increased the Bz-insensitive apical cation flux in TRCs without a change in cell volume, increased transepithelial electrical resistance across the tongue, and elicited CT responses that were similar to salt responses, consisting of both a transient phasic component and a sustained tonic component.

Neuronal injury triggers the release of ciliary neurotrophic factor ( CNTF ), promoting local neuronal repair but producing systemic effects of anorexia and lean body weight loss. Due to the rapid rate of systemic protein loss stimulated by CNTF, we hypothesized involvement of the hepatic ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic (UPP) pathway in CNTF -induced proteolysis. To assess the role of central CNTF in systemic UPP regulation, we measured hepatic UPP mRNA and proteasome activity in a rat model of neuronal injury and determined alterations induced by intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of CNTF -neutralizing antibody or additional exogenous CNTF. We also assessed proteolytic parameters and nutritional status by measuring caloric intake, body weight, and protein levels. We produced neuronal injury by implanting a lateral ventricle cannula and giving daily ICV saline bolus injections, which increased hepatic 20S proteasome mRNA and enzymatic activity while reducing caloric intake, body weight, and protein levels compared to controls. Administration of ICV anti- CNTF antibodies (but not control antibodies) prevented these effects.

Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an important mode of action of many chemotherapeutic agents. Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) is a model oxidant that has been used to study the response of cells to oxidative stress. The role of p53 in ROS induced cell death has not been consistent and has been shown to be cell type dependent. Study of cellular and molecular parameters and mechanisms involved in H(2)O(2) induced cell death in glioma cells will contribute to the understanding of response of these cells to oxidative stress. We investigated induction of cell death by H(2)O(2), and its relation to p53 in two human glial tumor derived cell lines U87MG (wild type p53 ) and U373MG (mutated p53 ). We observed that H(2)O(2) was able to induce apoptosis (as shown by morphology, flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation studies) in U87MG in a dose dependent manner. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a known ROS scavenger, was protective to the cells. H(2)O(2) induced cell death was significantly reduced by antisense p53 oligonucleotide. Pretreatment with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an inhibitor of the redox sensitive transcription factor NF-kappa B, abrogated the increased expression of p53 protein in response to H(2)O(2), and enhanced cell survival. The U373MG cell line, having mutated p53, was comparatively resistant to H(2)O(2) induced cell death.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Prior research has demonstrated that globin ontogeny of hamster proceeds nearly to completion during the several days that yolk sac erythroid cells (YSEC) circulate in the embryo; synthesis of embryonic globin chains gives way to synthesis of adult globin chains in these primitive cells. In the present study, we translated total cell RNA extracted from YSEC on days 9-13 of gestation in wheat germ cell-free extract, expecting to observe the same progressive rise that occurs in vivo in rates of translation of alpha- and beta- globin mRNA during ontogeny. The opposite occurred; translation rates of both globin s decreased sharply. This disparity between synthesis of alpha- and beta- globin s in vivo and in vitro suggested an element of control of translation attributable to the YSEC cytoplasm. We therefore assayed the effect of RNA-free clarified YSEC cytoplasm on cell-free translation of YSEC RNA. A repression of translation was detected of alpha- and beta- globin mRNA (not of embryonic globin mRNA), exercised strongly by cytoplasm from YSEC early in ontogeny (gestational day 9), and weakening as ontogeny progressed. The same effect was noted on alpha- and beta- globin mRNA of adult hamster and of rabbit. Heat treatment of cytoplasm abolished the greater part of the translation regulation, suggesting that the active agent is protein. Further characterization of this translational regulator included: (a) it binds to globin poly(A) mRNA but not to poly(A), (b) it was not detected in cell lysate of adult hamster brain, lung, or erythrocytes, and (c) it did not inhibit translation of adult hamster brain and liver RNA.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) was previously shown to be produced constitutively by malignant epithelial cells and by monocytes/macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells following stimulation. In this study we investigated the ability of medulloblastoma cells, representing malignant embryonal neuroectodermal cells, to produce G-CSF. Conditioned medium was freshly prepared from unstimulated explanted tumor tissue from two patients with medulloblastoma as well as from the medulloblastoma cell lines TE-671 and DAOY, and as controls normal glial cells. Following 72 hours of culture at a density of 5 x 10(5) cells/ml in RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS, the supernatants were harvested and tested for the presence of G-CSF in (1) the CFU-GM asay, (2) proliferation assay using the G-CSF dependent cell line NFS-60, and (3) Western blot analysis using an anti- G-CSF monoclonal antibody.

Two counteracting processes determine accumulation of human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in atherosclerotic lesions: cell proliferation and apoptosis. SMCs synthesize insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which potently inhibits apoptosis. The terminal complement complex C5b-9 interacts with SMCs in early human atherogenesis. In this study, we investigated whether C5b-9 may activate the IGF-1 system in SMCs, resulting in the inhibition of SMC apoptosis. C5b-9 generation on SMCs in vitro markedly reduced CD95-mediated apoptosis as assessed by flowcytometric analysis of annexin V binding and in caspase 3 assays. C5b-9 induced both significant IGF-1 release and up-regulation of IGF-1 binding sites in SMCs.

An investigation was carried out to determine whether bovine PTH stimulates lipolysis in human fat tissue, whether this action is mediated by cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate and whether the N-terminal 1-34 peptide of bovine PTH is responsible for the lipolytic effect. Studies were also performed to determine if parathyroid extract (PTE) produces lipolysis in normal subjects and in patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism in whom there is a defect in the adenylate system in response to PTH in the renal cortex and presumably in the skeletal system as well. It was found that highly purified bovine PTH in the concentration range between 10(-9) M and 10(-5) M stimulated lipolysis in vitro by human fat in a dose-dependent manner. Significant increases in glycerol production were observed at concentrations of PTH as low as 10(-9) M and maximal increases were seen at 10(-6) M. The hormone significantly increased the concentration of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate in fat tissue. The synthetic N-terminal 1-34 peptide of bovine PTH was as effective as the native hormone in stimulating glycerol production at a concentration of 10(-9) M-10(-6) M. PTE, 100 mU per kg per min for 30 min given intravenously, produced transient increases in the concentration of plasma free fatty acid in each of eight normal subjects, three patients with hypoparathyroidism and eight patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism.

It has been suggested that lithium exerts some of its pharmacological actions by inhibition of the membrane-bound enzyme adenylate cyclase. However, the relationship between the lithium inhibition of adenylate cyclase and the corresponding physiological parameters, e.g. lipolysis, has not been investigated. In the present study it was found that lithium inhibited both the norepinephrine-induced accumulation of cAMP and release of glycerol in isolated rat fat cells, but only in the lower dose range of norepinephrine. At maximally effective concentrations of norepinephrine, where in the presence of 40 mM of lithium the formation of cAMP was reduced by approximally 40%, lipolysis remained unaffected. The basal content of cAMP and the basal release of glycerol were not inhibited by lithium. In addition to the inhibitory effect of lithium, lithium was found to stimulate the release of glycerol. This stimulatory effect of lithium may be explained by a prevention by lithium of the feedback inhibition by free fatty acids of adenylate cyclase and/or triglyceride lipase, since it could be avoided by increasing the concentration of bovine serum albumin in the incubation medium.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Nicotine, a component of cigarette smoke, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. We examined whether nicotine regulates angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), an enzyme that plays an important role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and hypertension. Human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells were treated with nicotine (0.1-1 microM) alone or in combination with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 0.5 nM) or GF-109203X (GFX; 2.5 microM). The amount of ACE in intact endothelial cells was measured by an inhibitor-binding assay method, and ACE mRNA levels were quantified using LightCycler technology. Phosphorylated PKC levels were measured by Western immunoblotting. Nicotine did not modulate basal ACE production but significantly potentiated VEGF-induced ACE upregulation.

GH stimulates growth plate chondrogenesis and longitudinal bone growth directly at the growth plate. However, it is not clear yet whether these effects are entirely mediated by the local expression and action of IGF-1 and IGF-2. To determine whether GH has any IGF-independent growth-promoting effects, we generated (TamCart)Igf1r(flox/flox) mice. The systemic injection of tamoxifen in these mice postnatally resulted in the excision of the IGF-1 receptor (Igf1r) gene exclusively in the growth plate. (TamCart)Igf1r(flox/flox) tamoxifen-treated mice [knockout (KO) mice] and their Igf1r(flox/flox) control littermates (C mice) were injected for 4 weeks with GH. At the end of the 4-week period, the tibial growth and growth plate height of GH -treated KO mice were greater than those of untreated C or untreated KO mice. The systemic injection of GH increased the phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5B in the tibial growth plate of the C and KO mice. In addition, GH increased the mRNA expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2 and the mRNA expression and protein phosphorylation of nuclear factor-B p65 in both C and KO mice.

Autophagy is associated with drug resistance which has been a threat in chemotherapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The interconnected molecular regulators between autophagy and apoptosis serve as switching points critical to the ultimate outcome of the cell. Our study was performed to investigate the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis in HCC after the treatment of matrine. Flow cytometry and TUNEL (terminal dexynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling) assay were used to detect apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Bax oligomerization and Cytochrome c release assay were performed. Immunoprecipitation and siRNA transfection were used to detect the interplay between Bcl-2/Bcl-xL,Bax, and Beclin 1.

The nucleotide sequence of a 5' segment of the human genomic c-fms proto-oncogene suggested that recombination between feline leukemia virus and feline c-fms sequences might have occurred in a region encoding the 5' untranslated portion of c-fms mRNA. The polyprotein precursor gP180gag-fms encoded by the McDonough strain of feline sarcoma virus was therefore predicted to contain 34 v-fms -coded amino acids derived from sequences of the c-fms gene that are not ordinarily translated from the proto-oncogene mRNA. The (gP180gag-fms) polyprotein was cotranslationally cleaved near the gag-fms junction to remove its gag gene-coded portion. Determination of the amino-terminal sequence of the resulting v-fms -coded glycoprotein, gp120v-fms, showed that the site of proteolysis corresponded to a predicted signal peptidase cleavage site within the c-fms gene product. Together, these analyses suggested that the linked gag sequences may not be necessary for expression of a biologically active v-fms gene product. The gag-fms sequences of feline sarcoma virus strain McDonough and the v-fms sequences alone were inserted into a murine retroviral vector containing a neomycin resistance gene. Both constructs were biologically active when transfected into NIH 3T3 cells and produced morphologically transformed foci at equivalent efficiencies.

Aging is associated with a decline in multiple aspects of cognitive function, with spatial cognition being particularly sensitive to age-related decline. Environmental stressors, such as high-fat diet ( HFD ) exposure, that produce a diabetic phenotype and metabolic dysfunction may indirectly lead to exacerbated brain aging and promote the development of cognitive deficits. The present work investigated whether exposure to HFD exacerbates age-related cognitive deficits in adult versus aged mice. Adult (5 months old) and aged (15 months old) mice were exposed to control diet or HFD for three months prior to, and throughout, behavioral testing. Anxiety-like behavior in the light-dark box test, discrimination learning and memory in the novel object/place recognition tests, and spatial learning and memory in the Barnes maze test were assessed. HFD resulted in significant gains in body weight and fat mass content with adult mice gaining significantly more weight and adipose tissue due to HFD than aged mice. Weight gain was attributed to food calories sourced from fat, but not total calorie intake. HFD increased fasting insulin levels in all mice, but adult mice showed a greater increase relative to aged mice. Behaviorally, HFD increased anxiety-like behavior in adult but not aged mice without significantly affecting spatial cognition. In contrast, aged mice fed either control or HFD diet displayed deficits in novel place discrimination and spatial learning. Our results suggest that adult mice are more susceptible to the physiological and anxiety-like effects of HFD consumption than aged mice, while aged mice displayed deficits in spatial cognition regardless of dietary influence.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Three types of beta adrenergic receptors ( AR 1-3) mediate the sympathetic activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT), the key thermogenic site for mice which is also present in adult humans. In this study, we evaluated adaptive thermogenesis and metabolic profile of a mouse with Ar2 knockout ( AR 2KO). At room temperature, AR 2KO mice have normal core temperature and, upon acute cold exposure (4 °C for 4 h), AR 2KO mice accelerate energy expenditure normally and attempt to maintain body temperature. AR 2KO mice also exhibited normal interscapular BAT thermal profiles during a 30-min infusion of norepinephrine or dobutamine, possibly due to marked elevation of interscapular BAT (iBAT) and of Ar1, and Ar3 mRNA levels. In addition, AR 2KO mice exhibit similar body weight, adiposity, fasting plasma glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides when compared with WT controls, but exhibit marked fasting hyperinsulinemia and elevation in hepatic Pepck (Pck1) mRNA levels. The animals were fed a high-fat diet (40% fat) for 6 weeks, AR 2KO mice doubled their caloric intake, accelerated energy expenditure, and induced Ucp1 expression in a manner similar to WT controls, exhibiting a similar body weight gain and increase in the size of white adipocytes to the WT controls. However, AR 2KO mice maintain fasting hyperglycemia as compared with WT controls despite very elevated insulin levels, but similar degrees of liver steatosis and hyperlipidemia.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

PTEN is a major tumor suppressor gene that has been shown to inhibit cell invasion. Its mutation has been found in 20-40% of malignant gliomas. Meanwhile, the type III EGFR mutation (EGFRvIII), which was frequently found in gliomas, promoted cell invasion. In the present study, the effects of PTEN on cell invasion were investigated in U87DeltaEGFR glioblastoma cells with EGFRvIII expression but missing PTEN. The cell invasion was downregulated by transfection of phosphatase-active forms of PTEN (wild-type and G129E) but not by PTEN (C124A) with an inactive phosphatase domain; the effects were correlated with decreased tyrosine phosphatase levels of FAK at Tyr397, which was increased by EGFRvIII. Overexpression of FAK mutant (Y397F) could partially mimic the effect of PTEN on cell invasion. Although EGFRvIII increased the levels of P-Akt and PTEN eliminated it, PI-3K inhibitors, wortmannin or Ly294002, could not decrease the cell invasion.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Fifteen cows (87 +/- 8 d in lactation; 641 +/- 33 kg BW) were randomly assigned to treatment and then subjected for 182 d to daily sc injection (1000 hr), in the cervical area, of saline (control), thyrotropin-releasing factor (TRF: 1 micrograms/kg BW), growth hormone-releasing factor (1-29)NH2 ( GRF ; 10 micrograms/kg BW) or GRF plus TRF (10 and 1 micrograms/kg BW, respectively) according to a 2 x 2 factorial design. On days 1, 31, 88 and 179, jugular blood samples were collected from 2 hr before to 6 hr after injection. Samples were also collected for 5 consecutive days after cessation of treatment. GRF always induced growth hormone (GH) release (600 vs 7925 ng.min/ml) with augmentation of response with time (interaction GRF * day; P less than.001). TRF did not affect (P greater than.25) GH release ; there was no interaction (P greater than.25) with time. There was no significant interaction (P greater than.25) between GRF and TRF on GH release. However, the amount of GH release with GRF plus TRF was always greater than with GRF alone (9419 vs 6431 ng.min/ml). TRF induced a significant release of prolactin (23769 vs 42175 ng.min/ml) but GRF reduced the amount of prolactin release on the last day of sampling. TRF induced thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) release only on the first day of injection while triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) continued to respond to TRF throughout the treatment period.

Liver X receptor-alpha ( LXR alpha) is considered a master regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism; however, little is known about the link between LXR activation, hepatic insulin signaling, and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-apolipoprotein B (apoB) assembly and secretion. Here, we examined the effect of LXR alpha activation on hepatic insulin signaling and apoB-lipoprotein production. In vivo activation of LXR alpha for 7 days using a synthetic LXR agonist, TO901317, in hamsters led to increased plasma triglyceride (TG; 3.6-fold compared with vehicle-treated controls, P = 0.006), apoB (54%, P  0.0001), and VLDL-TG (eightfold increase compared with vehicle). As expected, LXR stimulation activated maturation of sterol response element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) as well as the SREBP-1c target genes steroyl CoA desaturase (SCD) and fatty acid synthase (FAS). Metabolic pulse-chase labeling experiments in primary hamster hepatocytes showed increased stability and secretion of newly synthesized apoB following LXR activation. Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) mRNA and protein were unchanged, however, likely because of the relatively short period of treatment and long half-life of MTP mRNA. Examination of hepatic insulin -signaling molecules revealed LXR -mediated reductions in insulin receptor (IR)beta subunit mass (39%, P = 0.014) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (24%, P = 0.023), as well as increases in protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)1B (29%, P  0.001) protein mass.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
In conclusion, <el> LXR <le> activation dysregulates hepatic <re> insulin <er> signaling and leads to a considerable increase in the number of circulating TG-rich VLDL-apoB particles, likely due to enhanced hepatic assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins. negative----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

Insulin stimulates glucose transport by promoting translocation of the insulin -sensitive glucose transporter isoform 4 (GLUT4) from an intracellular compartment to the cell surface. This movement is accomplished by stimulation of GLUT4 exocytosis as well as inhibition of endocytosis. However, the molecular mechanisms for these effects remain unclear. In this study, we found that the GTP-binding protein Rab5 physically associated with the motor protein dynein in immunoprecipitants from both untransfected cells and cells transfected with GFP- Rab5 constructs. Microinjection of anti- Rab5 or anti-dynein antibody into 3T3-L1 adipocytes increased the basal level of surface GLUT4, did not change the insulin -stimulated surface GLUT4 level, and inhibited GLUT4 internalization after the removal of insulin. Photoaffinity labeling of Rab5 with [gamma-(32)P]GTP-azidoanilide showed that insulin inhibited Rab5 -GTP loading. By using microtubule-capture assays, we found that insulin also caused a significant decrease in the binding of dynein to microtubules. Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 inhibited the effects of insulin on both Rab5 -GTP loading and dynein binding to microtubules.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

This study was performed to examine some ocular actions of an opioid agonist. Experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of a delta opioid agonist, DPDPE ([D-pen2, D-pen5]enkephalin (where pen = penicillamine)), on: 1) intraocular pressure ( IOP ) in rabbits; 2) cAMP accumulation in rabbit iris ciliary bodies (ICBs). Unilateral, topical administration of DPDPE caused bilateral depression of IOP. Intravitreal injection of DPDPE caused a greater IOP decrease than intravitreal injection of NaH2PO4 (vehicle). Topical administration of naloxone partially inhibited the effect of DPDPE on IOP in normal rabbits. In other experiments, DPDPE suppressed both basal and isoproterenol (ISO)-stimulated cAMP accumulation in ICBs. The presence of naltrindole (NTI), a delta receptor antagonist, did not prevent the suppression of cAMP levels by DPDPE.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Tumour necrosis factor  (TNF) and TNFrelated apoptosis inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) usually trigger either survival or apoptosis signals in various cell types, and nuclear factor B ( NF B) is a key factor that regulates their biological effects. Connexin 32 (Cx32) is a gap junction (GJ) protein that plays vital roles in tumourigenesis and tumour progression. Our previous study explored abnormal Cx32 expression in paranuclear areas, exacerbated prognostic parameters and suppressed streptonigrin/cisplatin-induced apoptosis in human cervical cancer (CaCx) cells. In this study, we investigated the role of Cx32 in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway of CaCx cells. In transgenic HeLa cells and C-33A cells, Cx32 expression was manipulated using doxycycline or Cx32 siRNA. GJ inhibitors or low density culturing was used to change the status of gap junction intracellular communication (GJIC). We found that apoptosis induced by TNF and TRAIL was suppressed by Cx32 expression despite the presence or absense of GJIC. We also found that Cx32 upregulated the expression of nuclear NF B and its downstream targets c-IAP1, MMP2, and MMP9 in HeLaCx32 and C-33A cells. Following our previous study design, our clinical data showed that NF B and MMP2 levels increased in human CaCx specimens with high Cx32 expression compared to levels in paracarcinoma of cervical specimens.

In a dose-dependent manner (10(-10) M to 10(-6) M), EGF increased autophosphorylation of Raf-1-K and activated MAPKK, MAPK and S6K. Sequential activation of these kinases was indicated by their peak times of activation ( Raf-1-K 5 min; MAPKK 10 min; MAPK 15 min; and S6K 30 min). AVP (10(-9) M to 10(-6) M) inhibited EGF -stimulated MAP kinase cascade. 8-Bromo-cyclic AMP (cAMP) could mimic the inhibitory effect of AVP on EGF -stimulated MAP kinase cascade.

The Na(+)-coupled glucose transporter SGLT1 (SLC5A1) accomplishes concentrative cellular glucose uptake even at low extracellular glucose concentrations. The carrier is expressed in renal proximal tubules, small intestine and a variety of nonpolarized cells including several tumor cells. The present study explored whether SGLT1 activity is regulated by caveolin-1, which is known to regulate the insertion of several ion channels and carriers in the cell membrane. To this end, SGLT1 was expressed in Xenopus oocytes with or without additional expression of caveolin-1 and electrogenic glucose transport determined by dual electrode voltage clamp experiments. In SGLT1 -expressing oocytes, but not in oocytes injected with water or caveolin-1 alone, the addition of glucose to the extracellular bath generated an inward current (Ig), which was increased following coexpression of caveolin-1. Kinetic analysis revealed that caveolin-1 increased maximal Ig without significantly modifying the glucose concentration required to trigger half maximal Ig (KM). According to chemiluminescence and confocal microscopy, caveolin-1 increased SGLT1 protein abundance in the cell membrane. Inhibition of SGLT1 insertion by brefeldin A (5M) resulted in a decline of Ig, which was similar in the absence and presence of caveolin-1.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The aims of the present study were to determine whether prostaglandins (PGs) and PPAR  are involved in the stimulation of tissue-non-specific alkaline phosphatase ( TNAP ) activity and mineralization by TNF- in human osteoblasts. We used osteoblasts differentiated from MSCs from three different donors and MG-63 osteoblast-like cells. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis with the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin or the specific COX-2 blocker NS-398 abolished mineralization in the absence and presence of 1 ng/ml of TNF-, suggesting that PGs were involved. The TNAP inhibitor levamisole abolished TNF- effects on mineralization, suggesting that PGs were involved in TNAP expression and mineralization. TNF- stimulated expression of COX-2 and PG E synthase before that of TNAP, but expression of PG D synthase later suggesting that PGE2 and PGF2 but not 15d-PGJ2 were involved in TNF- effects. However, both PGE2 and PGF2 dose-dependently inhibited mineralization indicating that endogenous PG are required for mineralization but that TNF- does not increase mineralization by increasing PG synthesis. Interestingly, TNF- inhibited PPAR  expression and binding activity to PPRE consensus sequences independently of 15d-PGJ2. Inhibition of PPAR  activity with GW-9662 mimicked TNF- effects in MG-63 cells, indicating that TNF- stimulates mineralization by inhibiting PPAR  in osteoblasts. In MSC-derived osteoblast cultures, inhibition of PPAR  dropped TNAP expression and mineralization.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The temporal relationships between LH, estradiol and progesterone in peripheral serum of the ewe were characterized throughout the estrous cycle. Between successive preovulatory LH sruges, serum concentrations of LH fluctuated markedly in a manner indicative of pulsatile discharges. Mean serum LH and progesterone concentrations were inversely related, LH being highest during the early and late luteal phases of the estrous cycle and lowest in the mid-luteal phase. A progressive, 5-fold increase in serum LH concentrations occurred between the onset of the precipitous fall in circulating progesterone attendant to luteolysis and the initiation of the preovulatory LH surge. Two major increments in circulating estradiol were observed in each cycle, both occurring when serum LH concentrations were relatively high. One estradiol increment occurred during the early luteal phase, the other during the 2-3 days prior to onset of the preovulatory LH surge. The latter estradiol increment thus accompanied the progressive, 5-fold increase in circulating LH which precedes the LH surge. The observations are inconsistent with the view that tonic LH secretion in the ewe is solely a function of a negative feedback action of estradiol.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The mycotoxin ochratoxin A ( OTA ) is a naturally occuring contaminant of food. The genotoxic status of OTA is still controversial because contradictory results were obtained in various microbial and mammalian gene mutation assays. In this study, OTA was investigated to examine its potency to induce micronuclei (MN) in SHE cells. The SHE-micronucleus assay revealed that OTA induces MN in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The results of kinetochore analysis revealed that mainly clastogenic events are involved in OTA genotoxicity. Induction of mitotic disturbances can be closely related to changes of the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). The investigated time course of OTA -induced [Ca2+]i changes revealed that the obtained signal is a short spike signal resembling physiological responses. In the absence of extracellular calcium, a long-lasting signal indicates possible damage to intracellular calcium stores or channels. Our data show that the OTA -induced [Ca2+]i rise is caused by Ca2+ -release from intracellular stores as well as Ca2+ influx from extracellular area. Finally, the influence of the changed intracellular calcium level on the actin cytoskeleton was investigated. Visualization of the actin filaments revealed time- and concentration-dependent effects.

Efficient repair of chromosomal double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination relies on the formation of a Rad51 recombinase filament that forms on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) created at DSB ends. This filament facilitates the search for a homologous donor sequence and promotes strand invasion. Recently caffeine treatment has been shown to prevent gene targeting in mammalian cells by increasing non-productive Rad51 interactions between the DSB and random regions of the genome. Here we show that caffeine treatment prevents gene conversion in yeast, independently of its inhibition of the Mec1(ATR)/Tel1(ATM)-dependent DNA damage response or caffeine's inhibition of 5' to 3' resection of DSB ends. Caffeine treatment results in a dosage-dependent eviction of Rad51 from ssDNA. Gene conversion is impaired even at low concentrations of caffeine, where there is no discernible dismantling of the Rad51 filament. Loss of the Rad51 filament integrity is independent of Srs2's Rad51 filament dismantling activity or Rad51's ATPase activity and does not depend on non-specific Rad51 binding to undamaged double-stranded DNA.

The present study in the anesthetized dogs was designed to test the hypothesis that atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) attenuates whole kidney tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) mediated decreases in renal blood flow ( RBF ) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) produced by hypertonic saline (HS). Secondly, as adenosine (AD) has been implicated as a metabolic mediator of TGF, we also hypothesized that ANF would antagonize the renal actions of AD. To test this hypothesis, RBF and GFR were assessed in response to hypertonic saline (HS, 16%, i.r.) or adenosine (AD, 0.1 mumol/min, i.r.) in the presence and absence of exogenous ANF (100 ng/kg/min, i.r.). ANF attenuated HS-mediated reductions in GFR (HS, -39.6 +/- 9.8 ml/min vs. HS + ANF, -14.3 +/- 4.5 ml/min, P less than 0.05) and in RBF (HS, -143 +/- 35 ml/min vs. HS + ANF, -5 +/- 22 ml/min, P less than 0.05).

Epidemiological studies suggest that post-menopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) reduces colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence. Phytoestrogens, including the soy isoflavone genistein and coumestrol, are used by many women as alternatives to HRT. Previous studies showed that ovariectomy induced a 77% increase in intestinal adenoma number in the C57BL/6J-Min/+ (Min/+) mouse, an animal model of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)-associated CRC. Replacement of estradiol (E(2)) in ovariectomized Min/+ mice reduced tumor number to baseline and up-regulated the expression of estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta). We hypothesized that the phytoestrogens genistein and coumestrol would inhibit intestinal tumorigenesis in ovariectomized Min/+ mice. Min/+ and Apc(+/+) (WT) mice were ovariectomized and assigned to either a control diet or treatment with E(2), genistein or coumestrol. Treatment of ovariectomized Min/+ (Min/+ OX) mice with genistein resulted in a non-significant reduction in tumor number. Min/+ OX mice treated with coumestrol had significantly fewer tumors than untreated Min/+ OX controls and the same number of tumors as non-ovariectomized Min/+ mice. Bromodeoxyuridine migration assays also demonstrated that treatment with E(2) or coumestrol improved enterocyte migration rate.

The cell-membrane-permeable calcium probe quin2 acetoxymethyl ester ( quin2 AM) was ineffective, in comparison with o-phenanthroline, in protecting cells against H2O2-induced DNA single-strand breakage at H2O2 concentrations of about, and higher than, 0.5 mM. The present study shows that quin2 actually potentiated intracellular DNA damage at high H2O2 concentrations. H2O2-induced DNA breakage appeared within 5 min after exposure, and quin2 affected the induction of DNA breaks at both 0 degree C and 37 degrees C. Aurintricarboxylic acid, an endonuclease inhibitor, or a decrease in extracellular Ca2+, did not reduce DNA damage. These facts strongly suggest that the breaks were not produced by a Ca(2+)-dependent nuclease. We showed previously that, in the presence of Fe3+ and H2O2, quin2 strongly potentiated the formation of oxidizing species as well as plasmid DNA breakage, and, as could be expected for a transition-metal chelator, quin2 inhibited the Fenton reaction when Cu2+ was tested instead of Fe3+ [Sandström, Granström and Marklund (1994) Free Radicals Biol. Med. 16, 177-185]. In the present work with cultured cells, titration with quin2 AM showed that, despite the fact that Cu2+ has a three-to-four-orders-of-magnitude higher affinity for quin2 than has Fe3+, both inhibition and potentiation of H2O2-induced DNA damage occurred at quin2 AM concentrations of about 100 nM. Thus inhibition appeared not to involve Cu2+.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The toxin gliotoxin induces apoptosis or programmed cell death in a variety of immune cells including thymocytes. Apoptosis induced by gliotoxin in thymocytes is unaffected by protein synthesis inhibitors nor is it associated with early changes in intracellular calcium levels (Beaver and Waring, 1994). This work shows that the cell lines P815 and WEHI7 and murine thymocytes when treated with gliotoxin show an early incorporation of tritiated thymidine over the concentration range which causes apoptosis. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a marker for S phase, is elevated in cells following gliotoxin treatment and S phase DNA content is increased. Thymidine incorporation is inhibited by hydroxyurea, an inhibitor of replicative DNA synthesis not repair. Free radical scavangers have no effect on apoptosis induced by gliotoxin in thymocytes. Hydrogen peroxide-treated cells showed no enhanced thymidine incorporation and no apoptosis. Thus oxidative stress does not appear to be a factor in gliotoxin -induced apoptosis. Thymocytes treated with gliotoxin show increased phosphorylation of a 16.3 kDa protein, and apoptosis is inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, which also inhibited the increased thymidine incorporation in P815 cells.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Angiotensin II enhances the development of atherosclerotic lesion in which cellular proliferation and/or migration are critical steps. Although cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p27, and Rho/Rho-kinase pathway have recently been implicated as factors regulating these events cooperatively, their role in vivo has not been fully elucidated. We evaluated the contribution of p27 and Rho-kinase to angiotensin II -induced vascular injury using p27-deficient mice. Two-week angiotensin II (1500 ng/kg per minute SC) infusion elicited similar degrees of elevation in systolic blood pressure in wild-type mice (159+/-5 mm Hg) and p27-deficient mice (157+/-5 mm Hg; P>0.05). Angiotensin II infusion to wild-type mice resulted in increases in the medial thickness of aorta, proliferating cell number, and monocyte/macrophage infiltration within the vasculature. In p27-deficient mice, however, these changes were more prominent than those in wild-type mice. Treatment of wild-type mice with fasudil, a selective Rho-kinase inhibitor, did not alter blood pressure but significantly upregulated p27 expression, decreased medial thickness of aorta, reduced proliferating cell number, and prevented monocyte/macrophage infiltration. These protective effects of fasudil were attenuated in p27-deficient mice.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Signal Transducers and Activator of Transcription-3 ( STAT3 ) are latent transcription factors that are regulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs) in response to cellular activation by the IL-6 superfamily of cytokines to regulate cell cycle progression and/or apoptosis. Here we observe that STAT3 is inducibly mono-ubiquitinated and investigate its consequences. Using domain mapping and highly specific selected reaction monitoring-mass spectrometric assays, we identify lysine (K) 97 in its NH2-terminal domain as the major mono-ubiquitin conjugation site. We constructed a mono-ubiquitinated mimic consisting of a deubiquitinase-resistant monomeric ubiquitin fused to the NH2 terminus of STAT3 (ubiquitinated- STAT3 FP). In complex assays of ectopically expressed ubi- STAT3 -FP, we observed enhanced complex formation with bromodomain-containing protein 4 ( BRD4 ), a component of the activated positive transcriptional elongation factor (P-TEFb) complex. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments in STAT3 (+/-) and STAT3 (-/-) MEFs showed BRD4 recruitment to STAT3 -dependent suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 gene (SOCS3). The effect of a selective small molecule inhibitor of BRD4, JQ1, to inhibit SOCS3 expression demonstrated the functional role of BRD4 for STAT3 -dependent transcription. Additionally, ectopic ubiquitinated- STAT3 FP expression upregulated BCL2, BCL2L1, APEX1, SOD2, CCND1 and MYC expression indicating the role of ubiquitinated STAT3 in anti-apoptosis and cellular proliferation.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Energy is stored predominately as lipid in white adipose tissue (WAT) in distinct anatomical locations, with each site exerting different effects on key biological processes, including glucose homeostasis. To determine the relative contributions of subcutaneous and visceral WAT on glucose homeostasis, comparable amounts of adipose tissue from abdominal subcutaneous inguinal WAT (IWAT), intra-abdominal retroperitoneal WAT (RWAT), male gonadal epididymal WAT (EWAT), or female gonadal parametrial WAT ( PWAT ) were removed. Gonadal fat removal in both male and female chow-fed lean mice resulted in lowered glucose levels across glucose tolerance tests. Female lean C57BL/6J mice as well as male and female lean FVBN mice significantly improved glucose tolerance, indicated by decreased areas under glucose clearance curves. For the C57BL/6J mice maintained on a high-fat butter-based diet, glucose homeostasis was improved only in female mice with PWAT removal.

Sapovirus, an important cause of acute gastroenteritis in humans and animals, travels from the early to the late endosomes and requires late endosomal acidification for viral uncoating. However, the signaling pathways responsible for these viral entry processes remain unknown. Here we demonstrate the receptor-mediated early activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and mitogen-activated protein extracellular signal-regulated kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ ERK ) signaling pathways involved in sapovirus entry processes. Both signaling pathways were activated during the early stage of porcine sapovirus ( PSaV ) infection. However, depletion of the cell surface carbohydrate receptors by pretreatment with sodium periodate or neuraminidase reduced the PSaV -induced early activation of these signaling pathways, indicating that PSaV binding to the cell surface carbohydrate receptors triggered these cascades. Addition of bile acid, known to be essential for PSaV escape from late endosomes, was also found to exert a stiffening effect to stimulate both pathways. Inhibition of these signaling pathways by use of inhibitors specific for PI3K or MEK or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against PI3K or MEK resulted in entrapment of PSaV particles in early endosomes and prevented their trafficking to late endosomes. Moreover, phosphorylated PI3K and ERK coimmunoprecipitated subunit E of the V-ATPase proton pump that is important for endosomal acidification.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
Based on our data, we conclude that receptor binding of <el> PSaV <le> activates both PI3K/Akt and MEK/<re> ERK <er> signaling pathways, which in turn promote <el> PSaV <le> trafficking from early to late endosomes and acidification of late endosomes for <el> PSaV <le> uncoating. positive----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

Oscillatory behavior of glycolysis in cell-free extracts of rat skeletal muscle involves bursts of phosphofructokinase activity, due to autocatalytic activation by fructose-1,6-P2. Glucose-1,6-P2 similarly might activate phosphofructokinase in an autocatalytic manner, because it is produced in a side reaction of phosphofructokinase and in a side reaction of phosphoglucomutase using fructose-1,6-P2. When muscle extracts were provided with 1 mM ATP and 10 mM glucose, glucose-1,6-P2 accumulated in a stepwise, but monotonic, manner to 0.7 microM in 1 h. The stepwise increases occurred during the phases when fructose-1,6-P2 was available, consistent with glucose-1,6-P2 synthesis in the phosphoglucomutase side reaction. Addition of 5-20 microM glucose-1,6-P2 increased the frequency of the oscillations in a dose-dependent manner and progressively shortened the time interval before the first burst of phosphofructokinase activity. Addition of 30 microM glucose-1,6-P2 blocked the oscillations. The peak values of the [ATP]/[ADP] ratio were then eliminated, and the average [ATP]/[ADP] ratio was reduced by half. In the presence of higher, near physiological concentrations of ATP and citrate (which reduce the activation of phosphofructokinase by glucose-1,6-P2), high physiological concentrations of glucose-1,6-P2 (50-100 microM) increased the frequency of the oscillations and did not block them.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Vasoactive intestinal peptide ( VIP ) and peptide histidine-isoleucine (PHI) receptors and the signaling pathways to which they are coupled were characterized in dispersed gastric smooth muscle cells. Radioligand binding using 125I-labeled VIP and PHI identified 4 classes of receptors: VIP -preferring and PHI-preferring receptors recognized by both ligands and readily desensitized by the preferred ligand, and VIP -specific and PHI-specific receptors recognized by only 1 ligand and resistant to desensitization. All except VIP -specific receptors were coupled to adenylate cyclase. VIP -specific receptors mediated a G protein -coupled Ca2+ influx that led to activation of NO synthase (NOS), NO-dependent activation of soluble guanylate cyclase, and activation of guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) kinase resulting in muscle relaxation. The entire cascade was blocked by Ca2+ channel and/or calmodulin antagonists. The NOS inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine abolished L-[3H]citrulline (coproduct of NO synthesis) and cGMP generation and partly inhibited (52 +/- 4%) relaxation. The components of response mediated by VIP -specific receptors (increase in [Ca2+]i, L-[3H]citrulline, and cGMP) were preserved after desensitization.

In a multivariable analysis adjusted for International Prognostic Index rituximab improved event-free and overall survival both in patients with and without ECFI. Three-year event-free (79% vs 79%; P =.842) and overall survival (86% vs 88%; P =.351) rates were similar in 145 patients receiving and 57 not receiving radiotherapy. Without rituximab, the 2-year cumulative rate of central nervous system (CNS) disease was increased in 205 ECFI patients compared with 2586 non-ECFI patients (4.2% vs 2.8%; P =.038), whereas this was not observed with rituximab (1.6% in 83 ECFI vs 3.4% in 1252 non-ECFI patients; P =.682).

Ursodeoxycholate (UDCA), a hydrophilic bile salt, ameliorates hepatocellular injury by toxic bile salts and is used to treat cholestatic liver disease. However, the mechanisms of bile salt-mediated hepatocyte necrosis and UDCA cytoprotection remain unclear. Hepatocyte necrosis is thought to be caused by the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition (MMPT). Thus, the aims of our study were to determine if a toxic bile salt, glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDC) induces the MMPT and if so, whether UDCA prevents the bile salt-induced MMPT. The MMPT was assessed in isolated rat liver mitochondria. Cell viability was measured in isolated rat hepatocytes. GCDC induced the MMPT in a dose-dependent manner. The GCDC-induced MMPT was partially blocked by cyclosporin A plus trifluoperazine, known inhibitors of the MMPT.

Canalicular bile is modified along bile ducts through reabsorptive and secretory processes regulated by nerves, bile salts, and hormones such as secretin. Secretin stimulates ductular cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-dependent Cl- efflux and subsequent biliary HCO3- secretion, possibly via Cl-/HCO3- anion exchange (AE). However, the contribution of secretin to bile regulation in the normal rat, the significance of choleretic bile salts in secretin effects, and the role of Cl-/HCO3- exchange in secretin-stimulated HCO3- secretion all remain unclear. Here, secretin was administered to normal rats with maintained bile acid pool via continuous taurocholate infusion. Bile flow and biliary HCO3- and Cl- excretion were monitored following intrabiliary retrograde fluxes of saline solutions with and without the Cl- channel inhibitor 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoic acid (NPPB) or the Cl-/HCO3- exchange inhibitor 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS). Secretin increased bile flow and biliary excretion of HCO3- and Cl-. Interestingly, secretin effects were not observed in the absence of taurocholate. Whereas secretin effects were all blocked by intrabiliary NPPB, DIDS only inhibited secretin-induced increases in bile flow and HCO3- excretion but not the increased Cl- excretion, revealing a role of biliary Cl-/HCO3- exchange in secretin-induced, bicarbonate -rich choleresis in normal rats.

The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which localized hypothermia of a monitored extremity alters the assessment of recovery from vecuronium -induced neuromuscular blockade. Bilateral integrated evoked electromyographic (IEMG) responses were measured in the ulner distribution of 14 anaesthetized patients who had differing upper extremity temperatures as measured at the adductor pollicis to determine whether localized hypothermia alters the clinical assessment of spontaneous recovery from vecuronium -induced neuromuscular blockade. All patients received general anaesthesia with thiopentone, N2O/O2 and opioid; 11/14 patients received isoflurane for blood pressure control. Bilateral adductor pollicis, oesophageal and ambient temperatures, and IEMG evoked response (t1) expressed as percent unparalyzed control were recorded during the anaesthetic. The difference in evoked response between the warmer and the colder upper extremity was calculated at 25%, 50% and 75% spontaneous recovery from neuromuscular blockade in the warm extremity.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
Differences in temperature between extremities ranged from 0.2-11 degrees C.

The activation of liver macrophages is closely related to liver injury after HBV infection. Our previous results demonstrated that HBeAg played a key role in inducing macrophage activation. As we all know, miRNAs are involved in the regulation of multiple immune cell functions. Meanwhile, we have shown that miR-155 positively regulates HBeAg -induced macrophage activation and accelerates liver injury. Subsequently, based on our previous miRNA sequencing results, we further evaluated the role of miR-212-3p called 'neurimmiR' in HBeAg -induced macrophages in this study. First, miR-212-3p expression was significantly elevated in HBeAg -treated macrophages. Meanwhile, we found up-regulation of miR-212-3p significantly decreased the production of cytokines, whereas knockdown of miR-212-3p held the opposite effect by gains and losses of function. Mechanically, although MAPK signal pathway, including ERK, JNK and p38, was activated in HBeAg -induced macrophages, only ERK promoted the expression of miR-212-3p via transcription factor CREB, which was able to bind to the promoter of miR-212-3p verified by ChIP assay.

Extreme body mass indexes may impair reproductive outcome in assisted reproductive technologies. Leptin reflects the amount of body fat and could act as a modulator of oocyte quality through activation of specific transcription factors. The aim of this work was to establish whether: 1) leptin influences meiotic and cytoplasmic oocyte maturation ; 2) STAT3 and MAPK mediate the effects of leptin and 3) leptin modulates steroid secretion by cumulus-oocyte complexes (COC) during in vitro maturation (IVM). We confirmed immunolocalisation of leptin receptor in oocytes, cumulus/granulosa cells during the peri-ovulatory period. The confocal study showed that COC supplemented with 1, 10 and 100 ng/ml leptin had a significantly higher metaphase II (MII) percentage than those IVM without leptin (P0.05) and a similar MII index compared to the group supplemented with 10% FCS. Leptin did not increase the percentage of cytoplasmically matured oocytes in terms of cortical granule migration rate, whereas a significantly higher index was found in the FCS group (P0.001).

Aberrant DNA methylation is a common form of epigenetic alterations and it has been proved to be closely related to many cancers, while its role in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is not clear. This study focuses on the role of DNA methyltransferase 1 ( DNMT1 ) in EGFR-mutated NSCLC pathogenesis. First, the expression of DNMT1 was up-regulated, while the expressions of human mutL homolog 1(hMLH1) and human mutS homolog 2 (hMSH2) were down-regulated in EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients and cell line HCC827. The results of the correlation analysis showed that DNMT1 expression was inversely correlated with the expressions of hMLH1 and hMSH2. Then, we found that DNMT1 enhanced the promoter methylation levels of hMLH1 and hMSH2, thus suppressing their expressions. DNMT1 knockdown inhibited the proliferation of HCC827 cells, while both hMLH1 knockdown and hMSH2 knockdown could eliminate its inhibitory effect on cell proliferation. In xenograft mouse models, lentiviral vector-sh- DNMT1 could significantly reduce tumor volumes, confirmed that DNMT1 inhibited tumor cell proliferation in vivo.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The role of cholecystokinin ( CCK ) in the regulation of pancreatic amylase has not been fully clarified. We examined the effects of hyperCCKemia with chronic pancreatico-biliary diversion (PBD) and blockade of CCK (A)-receptor on rat pancreatic amylase activity and mRNA abundance. Also, we examined the relationship between diet and CCK in terms of regulation of pancreatic amylase. PBD was produced by transposition of the duodenal segment containing the ampulla of Vater to the upper ileum. A potent CCK (A)-receptor antagonist, devazepide, was injected (6 mg/kg body weight per day for 5 days) in the PBD rats fed with diets containing normal or low level of carbohydrate (695 or 345 g sucrose/kg diet). The specific activity and mRNA abundance of the pancreatic amylase were constantly lower 4, 10 and 28 days after PBD than those after the sham operation. Devazepide treatment completely restored the amylase activity lowered by PBD without any increases in amylase mRNA. Feeding a high-protein low-carbohydrate diet suppressed the pancreatic amylase activity and mRNA abundance in PBD rats to a similar degree in those treated, and those untreated, with devazepide.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The CovR /S (CsrR/S) two component system is a global regulator of virulence gene expression in the group A streptococcus (GAS, Streptococcus pyogenes). The response regulator, CovR, regulates about 15% of the genes of GAS, including its own operon. Using in vitro DNA binding assays with purified CovR protein, we found that CovR binds a DNA fragment including the covR promoter ( Pcov ). DNaseI footprint analyses showed that phosphorylation of CovR enhanced and extended the protected regions. The proposed CovR consensus binding sequence (ATTARA) was present at most, but not all protected regions. The effect of replacing the two thymine residues in the consensus binding sequence (CB) with guanine residues was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. Most, but not all, CB mutations reduced binding of CovR in vitro. Using a transcriptional reporter introduced in single copy into the GAS chromosome, we found that mutations at each CB completely or partially relieved CovR -mediated repression in vivo. This suggests that CovR regulation of Pcov is direct.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

ANG II increases fluid absorption in proximal tubules from young rats more than those from adult rats. ANG II increases fluid absorption in the proximal nephron, in part, via activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ). However, it is unclear how age-related changes in ANG II -induced stimulation of the PKC cascade differ as an animal matures. We hypothesized that the response of the proximal nephron to ANG II decreases as rats mature due to a reduction in the amount and activation of PKC rather than a decrease in the number or affinity of ANG II receptors. Because PKC translocates from the cytosol to the membrane when activated, we first measured PKC activity in the soluble and particulate fractions of proximal tubule homogenates exposed to vehicle or 10(-10) M ANG II from young (26 +/- 1 days old) and adult rats (54 +/- 1 days old). ANG II increased PKC activity to the same extent in homogenates from young rats (from 0.119 +/- 0.017 to 0.146 +/- 0.015 U/mg protein) (P  0.01) and adult rats (from 0.123 +/- 0.020 to 0.156 +/- 0.023 U/mg protein) (P  0.01). Total PKC activity did not differ between groups (0.166 +/- 0.018 vs. 0.181 +/- 0.023). We next investigated whether activation of the alpha-, beta-, and gamma- PKC isoforms differed by Western blot. In homogenates from young rats, ANG II significantly increased activated PKC -alpha from 40.2 +/- 6.5 to 60.2 +/- 9.5 arbitrary units (AU) (P  0.01) but had no effect in adult rats (46.1 +/- 5.1 vs. 48.5 +/- 8.2 AU).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Rioprostil reduced both basal and stimulated gastric secretory volume, as well as acid and pepsin secretion.

Patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) tend to have renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) abnormalities caused by abnormal behaviors such as strict dieting, fasting, vigorous exercise, self-induced vomiting and abuse of laxatives and/or diuretics.

The 24-h urine sodium concentration was significantly lower in AN patients before therapy than after therapy. Plasma aldosterone secretory response to A II was significantly higher in AN patients before therapy in both postural change and exogenous A II injection tests compared with after therapy response and that of controls.

Previously we showed that the distal element ( DE ) (-427 to -336 bp) within the pim-1 promoter appeared to regulate its prolactin (PRL)-induced transcription. To determine which specific DE sequences conferred PRL responsiveness, seven 12-bp deletion mutants ligated upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene were transfected into FDC/Nb2 cells. Results from promoter/ reporter studies showed that sequential 12-bp deletions of the DE significantly (p  0.001) reduced PRL responsiveness. An additional site, nuclear factor-1 (-224 to -217), was also mutated by deletion or point mutation; both abrogated promoter activation by PRL (p  0.0001). In other experiments, PRL signaling to pim-1 expression was investigated in FDC/Nb2 cells stably expressing the wild-type (WT) Jak2 cDNA or a carboxy-terminal kinase-deficient Jak2 mutant and in cells infected with adenoviral constructs of WT-Akt or dominant negative Akt.

Shikonin, a natural naphthoquinone isolated from the Chinese traditional medicine Zi Cao (purple gromwell), is known to suppress the growth of several cancer cell types. In this study, we evaluated the pro-apoptotic effects of shikonin on MCF-7 and HeLa cells, and investigated the underlying mechanism. Shikonin-induced apoptosis was associated with activation of caspase-3, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, up-regulation of p73, and down-regulation of BCL-2. Shikonin also induced up-regulation of the tumor suppressor gene, p16(INK4A). Increasing transcriptional activity of p16(INK4A) by shikonin treatment, we observed in luciferase promoter assay, reflects reduced promoter binding by down-regulation of ICBP90 (inverted CCAAT box binding protein, 90 kDa), which are involved in down-regulation of its partner, DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The E2F proteins are major regulators of the transcriptional program required to coordinate cell cycle progression and exit. In particular, E2f4 has been proposed to be the principal family member responsible for the regulation of cell cycle exit chiefly through its transcriptional repressive properties. We have previously shown that E2f4(-/-) mice display a marked macrocytic anemia implicating E2f4 in the regulation of erythropoiesis. However, these studies could not distinguish whether E2f4 was required for differentiation, survival, or proliferation control. Here, we describe a novel function for E2f4 in the promotion of erythroid proliferation. We show that loss of E2f4 results in an impaired expansion of the fetal erythroid compartment in vivo that is associated with impaired cell cycle progression and decreased erythroid proliferation. Consistent with these observations, cDNA microarray analysis reveals cell cycle control genes as one of the major class of genes down-regulated in E2f4(-/-) FLs, and we provide evidence that E2f4 may directly regulate the transcriptional expression of a number of these genes.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

It has been reported previously that cells of the murine myelomonocytic leukaemia cell line WEHI3B(D+) can be induced to differentiate into mature monocytes by incubation with post-endotoxin serum ( ES ), granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or actinomycin D (AMD). We have investigated the kinetics of the differentiation process in suspension cultures, using growth curves and morphological markers to analyze proliferation and differentiation. At low cell densities (less than 10(5)/ml) neither ES nor G-CSF changed the rate of WEHI3B(D+) proliferation; nor did these reagents induce the differentiation of WEHI3B(D+). In contrast, AMD caused growth arrest and initiated cell maturation, which was followed by cell death. The time course of maturation depended on AMD concentration. The addition of either ES or G-CSF at the time of AMD exposure or at times up to 20 hr after the beginning of AMD exposure resulted in a delay of cell death for up to 3 days and in an accumulation of mature monocytes. The kinetics of AMD-induced maturation were not affected by the time of ES or G-CSF addition.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Phytochrome B ( phyB ), a major photoreceptor in plants, interacts with transcription factors to regulate gene expression and induce various light responses. Recently, we identified an SR-like splicing factor, RRC1 (reduced red-light responses in cry1cry2 background 1), as a novel component of phyB signaling in Arabidopsis. RRC1 has a C-terminal arginine/serine-rich (RS) domain that is generally important for the regulation of alternative splicing. Whereas rrc1 hypomorphic mutant alleles produce truncated RRC1 proteins that lack the C-terminal region, including the RS domain, and exhibit splicing defects and reduced phyB signaling, the rrc1-4 null allele additionally displays pleiotropic developmental abnormalities with more severe splicing defects. Here, we show that transgenic Arabidopsis plants that express truncated RRC1 lacking the RS domain in the rrc1-4 null allele background exhibited the same phenotype as the hypomorphic alleles.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We performed a prospective random study to assess possible thyroid stunning by a 185- MBq iodine-131 dose used to diagnose thyroid remnants. Patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma were included after total or near-total thyroid ectomy. They were randomly assigned to two groups. In group 0 (G0, 32 patients), iodine-123 administration only was used to diagnose thyroid remnants and/or metastasis, so that no thyroid stunning by 131I would occur. In group 1 (G1, 19 patients), diagnostic imaging was performed with 123I and 185 MBq 131I. 123I imaging was less sensitive than 131I imaging in identifying thyroid remnants in both groups (94%). Thyroid uptake of 123I was measured in both groups (at 2 h) and was not significantly different between the groups. Patients with thyroid remnants who remained in the study (28/32 in G0, 17/19 in G1) were treated with 370 MBq 131I, 5 weeks after treatment (mean time, range 12-84 days).

The differentiation and survival of heterozygous Lurcher (+/Lc) Purkinje cells in vitro was examined as a model system for studying how chronic ionic stress affects neuronal differentiation and survival. The Lurcher mutation in the delta2 glutamate receptor ( GluRdelta2 ) converts an orphan receptor into a membrane channel that constitutively passes an inward cation current. In the GluRdelta2 (+/Lc) mutant, Purkinje cell dendritic differentiation is disrupted and the cells degenerate following the first week of postnatal development.

To initiate invasive infection, Staphylococcus aureus must adhere to host substrates, such as the extracellular matrix or eukaryotic cells, by virtue of different surface proteins (adhesins). Recently, we identified a 60-kDa cell-secreted extracellular adherence protein ( Eap ) of S. aureus strain Newman with broad-spectrum binding characteristics (M. Palma, A. Haggar, and J. I. Flock, J. Bacteriol. 181:2840-2845, 1999), and we have molecularly confirmed Eap to be an analogue of the previously identified major histocompatibility complex class II analog protein (Map) (M. Hussain, K. Becker, C. von Eiff, G. Peter, and M. Herrmann, Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 8:1281-1286, 2001). Previous analyses of the Eap /Map function performed with purified protein did not allow dissection of its precise role in the complex situation of the staphylococcal whole cell presenting several secreted and wall-bound adhesins. Therefore, the role of Eap was investigated by constructing a stable eap::ermB deletion in strain Newman and by complementation of the mutant. Patterns of extracted cell surface proteins analyzed both by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by Western ligand assays with various adhesive matrix molecules clearly confirmed the absence of Eap in the mutant. However, binding and adhesion tests using whole staphylococcal cells demonstrated that both the parent and mutant strains bound equally well to fibronectin- and fibrinogen-coated surfaces, possibly due to their recognition by other staphylococcal adhesins. Furthermore, Eap mediated staphylococcal agglutination of both wild-type and mutant cells.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Eicosanoids play a crucial role in inflammatory pain. However, there is very little knowledge about the contribution of oxidized linoleic acid metabolites in inflammatory pain and peripheral sensitization. Here, we identify 12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoic acid ( 12,13-DiHOME ), a cytochrome P450-derived linoleic acid metabolite, as crucial mediator of thermal hyperalgesia during inflammatory pain. We found 12,13-DiHOME in increased concentrations in peripheral nervous tissue during acute zymosan- and complete Freund's Adjuvant-induced inflammatory pain. 12,13-DiHOME causes calcium transients in sensory neurons and sensitizes the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)-mediated intracellular calcium increases via protein kinase C, subsequently leading to enhanced TRPV1-dependent CGRP-release from sensory neurons. Peripheral injection of 12,13-DiHOME in vivo causes TRPV1-dependent thermal pain hypersensitivity. Finally, application of the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH)-inhibitor TPPU reduces 12,13-DiHOME concentrations in nervous tissue and reduces zymosan- and CFA-induced thermal hyperalgesia in vivo.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Labor and its associated pain are thought to have unique impacts on parturient women. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of labor and associated pain on differential gene expression profiles in the maternal, fetal, and placental compartments. We used microarrays to analyze maternal blood ( MB ), fetal cord blood (CB), and placental tissue samples in pregnant women after term vaginal deliveries (laboring group) and in term pregnant women after scheduled Ceasarean sections (nonlaboring group). The upregulated genes in the MB of the laboring group are involved in cytokine and nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathways, regulation of the networks of toll-like receptor 4, and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3. Upregulated genes in the CB of the laboring group are involved in responding to stress and stimuli by regulating the network genes of the T-cell receptor beta locus and the FK506 binding protein 8. Differentially expressed genes in the placenta of the laboring group are involved in nitric oxide transport, gas transport, response to hydrostatic pressure, oxygen transport, acute phase responses, and the tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling pathway, which are important during the transient hypoxemia and hypoperfusion that occur in the placenta during uterine contractions. Interestingly, few of the genes exhibited simultaneous changes in all three compartments, indicating that different pathways and complex interactions may be involved in human labor.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

In a mouse model of herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 corneal infection, tissue destruction results from a CD4+ T cell-mediated chronic inflammation, in which interleukin 2 and interferon (IFN) gamma are requisite inflammatory mediators and polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( PMN ) are the predominant infiltrating cells. In vivo neutralization of IFN-gamma relieved inflammation at least in part through a specific block of PMN extravasation into HSV-1-infected corneas. Intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) 1 and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) 1 were upregulated on the vascular endothelium of inflamed corneas. Reduced PMN extravasation in anti- IFN-gamma -treated mice was associated with a dramatic reduction of PECAM-1 but not ICAM-1 expression on vascular endothelium. PMN accumulated in the lumen of corneal vessels after in vivo IFN-gamma neutralization. PECAM-1 was readily detectable on PMN inside the vessels but was not detectable on PMN that extravasated into the infected cornea. Moreover, flow cytometric analysis revealed reduced PECAM-1 expression but elevated major histocompatibility complex class I expression on PMN that recently extravasated into the peritoneal cavity when compared with PMN in the peripheral blood.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Interleukin (IL) 6 is a pleistropic cytokine with activities, among others, on immune cells, hematopoietic precursor cells and hepatocytes. We have investigated the kinetics and amplitude of its in vivo induction in mice after injection of four different IL 1 species as well as murine (m) and human (h) tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using a sensitive bioassay on 7TD1 cells to measure the IL 6 concentrations. Recombinant mIL 1 beta, administered as a single i.v. injection in mice, induced the appearance of IL 6 in the plasma with peak levels observed after 2 h. A dose-response correlation was found between serum IL 6 levels and injected IL 1 alpha concentrations at 3 and 8 h after the injection. We then compared the ability of h/mIL 1 alpha, h/mIL 1 beta, h/mTNF and LPS to induce IL 6 in mice.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

In the present study we report the properties of vasopressin (VP) receptors in the anterior pituitary gland and show that the number of these receptors is markedly affected by adrenalectomy and hypothalamic lesions. VP-binding activity was assayed in particulate fractions of rat anterior pituitary glands using tritium-labeled arginine VP ([3H] AVP ) as tracer. In the presence of Mg2+ the radioligand interacted with a single class of high affinity, low capacity binding sites. Magnesium ions modulated the affinity of the receptors but had no effect on binding capacity. Guanine nucleotides decreased the amount of tracer bound in a dose-dependent manner by increasing the dissociation constant (Kd) of the binding reaction by approximately 2-fold. Increasing the concentration of Mg2+ did not prevent this effect. Bilateral adrenalectomy (ADX) decreased pituitary AVP -binding activity: binding fell by 30% 4 h after surgery and declined further to 10% or less of control at 4 days. The decrease in binding was primarily due to a reduction in the number of receptors. Daily administration of corticosterone inhibited the reduction of binding activity at 4 days in a dose-dependent manner. Destruction of hypophyseotropic VP neurons by means of surgical lesioning of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus or the medial basal hypothalamus abolished the effect of ADX on pituitary AVP binding at 24 h but only attenuated the degree of receptor loss at 4 days. Furthermore, the lesions themselves caused a significant (approximately 30%) reduction in receptor number 4-7 days after hypothalamic surgery. Adrenalectomy reduced pituitary AVP -binding activity in homozygous (di/di) Brattleboro rats. The extent as well as the time course of the loss of receptor activity resembled that in normal rats.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
These observations allow the following conclusions: <el> Magnesium ions <le> and guanine nucleotides modulate the affinity of pituitary <re> AVP <er> receptors by different mechanisms and have no effect on binding capacity; Pituitary receptors for <re> AVP <er> are regulated by the amount of <re> AVP <er> released by paraventricular nucleus neurons as well as through a mechanism that requires the presence of corticosterone; Homozygous Brattleboro rats may respond to ADX by increased hypothalamic release of an endogenous ligand for pituitary <re> AVP <er> receptors. positive----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

B-RAF, a serine/threonine protein kinase, contributes to signaling of insulin-like growth factor IGF1. Effects of IGF1 include stimulation of proximal renal tubular phosphate transport, accomplished in large part by Na +-coupled phosphate cotransporter Na Pi-IIa. The related Na +-coupled phosphate cotransporter Na Pi-IIb accomplishes phosphate transport in intestine and tumor cells. The present study explored whether B-RAF influences protein abundance and/or activity of type II Na +-coupled phosphate cotransporters Na Pi-IIa and Na Pi-IIb. cRNA encoding wild-type Na Pi-IIa and wild-type Na Pi-IIb was injected into Xenopus oocytes with or without additional injection of cRNA encoding wild-type B-RAF, and electrogenic phosphate transport determined by dual-electrode voltage clamp. Na Pi-IIa protein abundance in Xenopus oocyte cell membrane was visualized by confocal microscopy and quantified by chemiluminescence. Moreover, in HEK293 cells, the effect of B-RAF inhibitor PLX-4720 on Na Pi-IIa cell surface protein abundance was quantified utilizing biotinylation of cell surface proteins and western blotting. In Na Pi-IIa-expressing Xenopus oocytes, but not in oocytes injected with water, addition of phosphate to extracellular bath generated a current (I P), which was significantly increased following coexpression of B-RAF. According to kinetic analysis, coexpression of B-RAF enhanced the maximal IP.

Modulation of neutrophil responses by adenosine may have an important role in limiting tissue injury during inflammation or ischemia-reperfusion. Mac-1 (CD11/CD18), a member of the leukocyte integrin family, participates in neutrophil adhesion to endothelium, in transendothelial migration, and in phagocytosis. Using monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry, we investigated the effect of adenosine on the increase in plasma membrane expression of Mac-1 which occurs following stimulation of neutrophils with the chemotactic peptide N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (FMLP). Adenosine and 5'N-ethylcarboxamido- adenosine, a potent A2 agonist, each produced a dose-dependent inhibition of as much as 50% of the increase in Mac-1 expression on neutrophils stimulated with FMLP, with an IC50 of approximately 1 nM. The effect of adenosine was blocked by 8-p-sulfophenyltheophylline, an adenosine -receptor antagonist, N6-cyclopentyl- adenosine, an A1-selective agonist, had no effect on FMLP-stimulated Mac-1 expression in the concentration range expected for its action on neutrophil adenosine receptors of the A1 type.

Tumor-initiating cells (also known as cancer stem cells) are the subpopulation of cells shown to be responsible for tumor initiation, maintenance and recurrence. In breast cancer, CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) cells were identified as tumor -initiating cells. We previously reported that a Gemini vitamin D analog, 1,25-dihydroxy-20R-21(3-hydroxy-3-deuteromethyl-4,4,4-trideuterobutyl)-23-yne-26,27-hexafluoro-cholecalciferol (BXL0124), reduced CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) cells in MCF10DCIS basal-like breast cancer cells. Since Notch has been identified as one of the key signaling pathways involved in breast cancer stem cells, the effect of BXL0124 on the Notch signaling pathway was investigated in breast cancer. The CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) subpopulation of MCF10DCIS cells showed elevated Notch1 signaling and increased cell proliferation compared to the CD44(+)/CD24(high) subpopulation. Treatment with the Gemini vitamin D analog BXL0124 decreased the level of activated Notch1 receptor. In addition, mRNA and protein levels of the Notch ligands, Jagged-1, Jagged-2 and DLL1, were significantly reduced by treatment with BXL0124, which was followed by repression of c-Myc, a key downstream target of Notch signaling. Interestingly, HES1, a known downstream target of Notch signaling, was rapidly induced by treatment with BXL0124. The inhibitory effect of BXL0124 on Notch signaling was reversed by knockdown of HES1. Overexpression of HES1 inhibited Notch1 signaling and reduced the CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) subpopulation, confirming a role of HES1 in Notch1 signaling.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The aim was to relate fibrin structure and the stimulatory effect of fibrin on plasmin ogen activation during t-PA-mediated fibrin olysis using Lys78- plasmin ogen as activator substrate. Structural studies were undertaken by static and dynamic laser light scattering, cryo transmission electron microscopy and by the measurement of conversion of fibrin to X-, Y- and D-fragments. The kinetics of plasmin formation were monitored by measurement of the rate of pNA-release from Val-Leu-Lys-pNA. The process of fibrin formation and degradation comprised three phases. In the first phase, protofibrils with an average length of about 10 times that of fibrin ogen were formed. The duration of this phase decreased with increasing t-PA concentration. The second phase was characterized by a sudden elongation and lateral aggregation of fibrin fibers, most pronounced at low levels of t-PA, and by formation of fragment X-polymer. The third phase was dominated by fragmentation of fibers and by formation of Y- and D-fragments. Plasmin degraded the fibers from within, resulting in the formation of long loose bundles, which subsequently disintegrated into thin filaments with a length of less than 10 and a mass per length close to one relative to fibrin ogen. Plasmin generation at high t-PA concentrations sets in just prior to (and at low t-PA concentrations shortly after) the onset of the rapid second phase of elongation and lateral aggregation of fibrin fibers. The maximal rate of plasmin formation per mol t-PA was the same at all concentrations of activator and was achieved close to the time of the peak level of fragment X-polymer. Plasmin formation ceased after formation of substantial amounts of Y- and D-fragments. At this stage the length was between 300 and 3 and the mass per length close to 1, both relative to fibrin ogen.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Separate reports that hypertonicity activates p38 via a Rac1- OSM -MEKK3-MKK3-p38 pathway and that p38 contributes to activation of TonEBP/ OREBP led us to the hypothesis that Rac1 might activate TonEBP/ OREBP via p38. The present studies examine that possibility. High NaCl is hypertonic. We find that siRNA knockdown of Rac1 reduces high NaCl-induced increase of TonEBP/ OREBP transcriptional activity (by reducing its transactivating activity but not its nuclear localization). Similarly, siRNA knockdown of osmosensing scaffold for MEKK3 ( OSM ) also reduces high NaCl-dependent TonEBP/ OREBP transcriptional and transactivating activities. Simultaneous siRNA knockdown of Rac1 and OSM is not additive in reduction of TonEBP/ OREBP transcriptional activity, indicating a common pathway. However, siRNA knockdown of MKK3 does not reduce TonEBP/ OREBP transcriptional activity, although siRNA knockdown of MKK6 does. Nevertheless, the effect of Rac1 on TonEBP/ OREBP is also independent of MKK6 because it occurs in MKK6-null cells. Furthermore, we find that siRNA knockdown of Rac1 or OSM actually increases activity (phosphorylation) of p38, rather than decreasing it, as previously reported. Thus, the effect of Rac1 on TonEBP/ OREBP is independent of p38. We find instead that phospholipase C-1 (PLC-1) is involved. When transfected into PLC-1-null mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, catalytically active Rac1 does not increase TonEBP/ OREBP transcriptional activity unless PLC-1 is reconstituted. Similarly, dominant-negative Rac1 also does not inhibit TonEBP/ OREBP in PLC-1-null cells unless PLC-1 is reconstituted.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Results presented in this study demonstrate an association between the L-Histidine -mediated enhancement of H2O2-induced cytotoxicity and the formation of DNA double strand breakage ( DSB ), whereas no relationship exists between the increased cytotoxic response and DNA single strand breakage (SSB). Indeed, the higher lethality and the production of DNA DSB occurred in oxidatively-injured cells regardless of whether the exposure to L-Histidine was performed before or during challenge with the oxidant. In fact, the increased level of DNA SSB detected in cells simultaneously exposed to the oxidant and the amino acid was not observed in cells pre-treated with L-Histidine and then challenged with hydrogen peroxide.

We and others have previously shown that exogenous alpha-MSH antagonizes the stimulatory effects of the cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. It is currently unknown, however, if endogenous alpha-MSH plays a physiological role in regulating the HPA response to IL-1. We have therefore examined the HPA response to IL-1beta in rats pretreated with an affinity purified alpha-MSH antiserum (AS) infused intracerebroventricularly to neutralize endogenous alpha-MSH within the brain. alpha-MSH AS or a similarly purified fraction of normal rabbit serum (NRS) was injected intracerebroventricularly at 16 h and at 1 h prior to the i.c.v. injection of IL-1beta (2 ng or 20 ng) and blood samples were collected through an indwelling atrial catheter. After 2 ng IL-1beta, the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) response was significantly greater in the alpha-MSH AS treated rats (n = 7) compared to the NRS treated rats (n = 7) (P 0.01); the mean ACTH level rose to a peak of 594+208 pg/ml in the alpha-MSH AS treated rats vs 274+/-122 pg/ml in the NRS treated rats.

Sesamin (Ses), one of the major lignan derived from sesame seeds, has been reported to have many benefits and medicinal properties. However, its protective effects against carbon tetrachloride ( CCl4 ) induced injury in liver have not been clarified. The aim of the present study was to investigate the hepatoprotective effects of sesamin on oxidative stress and apoptosis in mice exposed to CCl4. Our data showed that sesamin significantly prevented CCl4 -induced hepatotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner, indicated by both diagnostic indicators of liver damage (serum aminotransferase activities) and histopathological analysis. Moreover, CCl4 -induced profound elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative stress, as evidenced by increasing of lipid peroxidation level and depleting of the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in liver, were suppressed by treatment with sesamin. Furthermore, TUNEL assay showed that CCl4 -induced apoptosis in mouse liver was significantly inhibited by sesamin. In exploring the underlying mechanisms of sesamin action, we found that activities of caspase-3 were markedly inhibited by the treatment of sesamin in the liver of CCl4 treated mice. Sesamin increased expression levels of phosphorylated Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) in liver, which in turn inactivated pro-apoptotic signaling events restoring the balance between mitochondrial pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and decreasing the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c in liver of CCl4 treated mice.

The channel serves to maintain cell membrane potential, a prerequisite for signalling through the Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channel I(CRAC). As glucocorticoids are known to regulate lymphocyte function, the present study addressed the effect of dexamethasone on voltage-gated K+ channels in Jurkat T-lymphocytes. In whole-cell patch-clamp experiments current families evoked by 200-ms potential steps every 15 s from -70 mV to values from -120 to +100 mV revealed the functional expression of voltage-gated K+ channels. Pre-treatment of Jurkat T-lymphocytes for 2-3 h with 1 microM dexamethasone led to a significant decrease of voltage-gated K+ currents. Fura-2-fluorescence measurements showed that the readdition of Ca2+ to Ca(2+)-depleted cells led to a rapid increase of cytosolic Ca2+ activity.

The biological and molecular properties of two strains of Shope fibroma virus (SFV) were compared. SFV-I was highly cytocidal to most of the cell lines tested and produced pocks in the chorioallantoic membrane of chick embryos. By contrast, SFV-W did not produce cytopathic effects in any of the cell lines or in the chorioallantoic membrane, but it induced characteristic foci 3 to 4 days after infection. Both strains produced tumors when inoculated into the skin of susceptible rabbits. Maximal infectivity in BSC-1 cells was reached by both strains between 24 to 48 h after inoculation. Viral DNA synthesis also took place at the same time, although cells infected with SFV-I incorporated three times more [(3)H]thymidine than cells infected with SFV-W. Sedimentation analysis and hydroxylapatite chromatography of the two viral DNAs indicated that their molecular weights were similar and that both were naturally cross-linked. Digestion with three restriction endonucleases, however, revealed that they had different restriction sites. When SFV-I and vaccinia DNA were compared, the restriction patterns were more alike.

Immune-checkpoint blockade antibodies have been approved for the treatment of cancer. However, poorly immunogenic tumours are less responsive to such therapies. Agonistic anti-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) activate only cell-surface TLR4; in contrast, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activates both TLR4 and intracellular inflammatory caspases. In this study, we investigated the adjuvant activity of an anti-TLR4 mAb in T-cell-mediated antitumour immunity. The anti-TLR4 mAb induced the activation of antigen-specific T-cells in adoptive transfer studies. The growth of ovalbumin (OVA)-expressing tumours was significantly suppressed by administration of OVA and the anti-TLR4 mAb in combination, but not individually. The antitumour effect of anti-PD-1 mAb was enhanced in mice administered with OVA plus the anti-TLR4 mAb. The OVA-specific IFN--producing CD8 T-cells were induced by administration of OVA and the anti-TLR4 mAb. The suppression of tumour growth was diminished by depletion of CD8, but not CD4, T-cells. The inflammatory response to the anti-TLR4 mAb was of significantly lesser magnitude than that to LPS, as assessed by NF-B activation and production of TNF-, IL-6 and IL-1. Administration of LPS (at a dose that elicited levels of proinflammatory cytokines comparable to those by the anti-TLR4 mAb ) plus OVA induced no or less-marked activation of OVA-specific T-cells and failed to suppress tumour growth in mice.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

If adenosine ( ADO ) mediates metabolic vasodilation in the heart, increases in interstitial ADO (ISF[ ADO ]) must accompany increases in coronary vascular conductance. We tested this using ADO release, defined as the difference in [ ADO ] in coronary venous and arterial plasma multiplied by coronary plasma flow, as an index of ISF[ ADO ]. Pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs received intravenous norepinephrine or left atrial pacing, and the resulting changes in coronary blood flow (delta CBF), conductance (delta C), myocardial oxygen consumption (delta VO2), and ADO release (delta RADO) were measured. If ISF[ ADO ] and C are coupled, the ratio delta RADO/delta C should be greater than zero. For dogs receiving atrial pacing, the ratios delta RADO/delta C, delta RADO/delta CBF, and delta RADO/delta VO2 equal -2.4 +/- 2.2 nmol. mmHg-1. ml-1, -0.022 +/- 0.020 nmol/ml, and -0.13 +/- 0.12 nmol/ml, respectively.

We have previously shown that pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells rapidly depolarize and undergo Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in response to moderate hypoxia and that intracellular free Ca2+ is modulated by activation of dopamine D2 receptors in this cell type. The present study shows that D2 (quinpirole-mediated) inhibition of a voltage-dependent Ca2+ current ( ICa ) in PC12 cells is dramatically attenuated after chronic exposure to moderate hypoxia (24 h at 10% O2). Pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin abolished D2 -mediated inhibition of ICa. The D2 -induced inhibition of ICa did not depend on protein kinase A (PKA), as it persisted both in the presence of a specific PKA inhibitor (PKI) and in PKA-deficient PC12 cells. Prolonged exposure to hypoxia (24 h) significantly reduced the level of Gi/o alpha immunoreactivity, but did not alter G beta levels. Furthermore, dialysis of recombinant G(o) alpha protein through the patch pipette restored the inhibitory effect of quinpirole in cells chronically exposed to hypoxia.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

A 1.37 Mbp region of chromosome 13 previously identified by exclusion mapping was consistently associated with a reduction of salt-induced hypertension in the Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rat. This region contained five genes that were introgressed from the salt-insensitive Brown Norway (BN) rat. The goal of the present study was to further narrow that region to identify the gene(s) most likely to protect from salt-induced hypertension. The studies yielded a subcongenic SS rat strain containing a 0.71 Mbp insert from BN (26-P strain) in which salt-induced hypertension was reduced by 24 mmHg. The region contained two protein-coding genes (Astn1 and Pappa2 ) and a microRNA (miR-488). Pappa2 mRNA in the renal cortex of the protected 26-P was 6- to 10-fold greater than in SS fed a 0.4% NaCl diet but was reduced to levels observed in SS when fed 8.0% NaCl diet for 7 days. Compared with brain nuclei (NTS, RVLM, CVLM) and the adrenal gland, Pappa2 in the renal cortex was the only gene found to be differentially expressed between SS and 26-P and that responded to changes of salt diet. Immunohistochemistry studies found Pappa2 localized in the cytosol of the epithelial cells of the cortical thick ascending limbs. In more distal segments of the renal tubules, it was observed within tubular lumens and most notably bound to the apical membranes of the intercalated cells of collecting ducts.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The adaptive capacity of the aging kidney to stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, as induced by a 30-minute mental stress (MS), was assessed in 8 elderly healthy women (68 to 82 years of age) and compared with that of 8 younger women (24 to 40 years of age). The study encompassed 4 consecutive 30-minute periods (baseline, mental stress, recovery 1, and recovery 2). In the elderly subjects, baseline effective renal plasma flow (ERPF)(iodine 131-labeled hippurate clearance) was lower and glomerular filtration rate (GFR)(iodine 125-labeled iothalamate clearance) was proportionally less reduced than in the younger group; the filtration fraction (FF) was higher. The elderly group excreted more endothelin 1 (ET-1) (P .05), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and 6-keto- prostaglandin F1alpha (6-keto PGF1alpha)(P .001 for both)(radioimmunoassay). Mental stress induced similar increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and plasma catecholamines in the 2 age groups, limited to the stimulation period. In the elderly group, mental stress caused a prolonged decrease in ERPF that reached its maximum 60 minutes after mental stress (-33%, P .05), while GFR remained constant during the whole experiment, so that FF increased. In the younger subjects, renal hemodynamic changes were limited to the mental stress period. ET-1 increased during mental stress and the first recovery period in the elderly group (+50% and +25%, P .05) as it did in the younger group, but the elderly group differed from the younger in that vasodilating prostaglandin s increased only during mental stress.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

To elucidate the role of protein synthesis in DNA formation, E. coli R2 infected with phage T2 was studied as a model, employing chloramphenicol to inhibit protein synthesis. The following results were obtained. 1. Chloramphenicol inhibited protein synthesis but not synthesis of nucleic acids in uninfected bacteria. 2. Studies of the effect of chloramphenicol on phage maturation indicated a delay of 2 minutes between time of addition and cessation of phage growth. 3. The increase of DNA in phage-infected bacteria was completely suppressed by the addition of chloramphenicol within 2 minutes following infection. Addition at later times showed progressively less inhibitory action depending upon the time interval, and addition after the 10th or 12th minute showed no appreciable effect on DNA synthesis despite the cessation of intracellular phage formation and protein synthesis. 4. When chloramphenicol was added to infected cells the increase of resistance to UV stopped within 2 minutes, whether or not DNA synthesis continued. Thus evolution of resistance paralleled the rate of DNA synthesis achieved, but not the amount of DNA accumulated. 5.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

In mammals, visual experience during early postnatal life is critical for normal development of the visual system. Here we report that monocular deprivation for 2, 7, and 14 consecutive days causes p53 accumulation, cell death, and progressive loss of neurones in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of newborn rats and these are prevented by NMDA and non-NMDA glutamate receptor antagonists, and by L-NAME, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis. Monocular deprivation also increases dLGN levels of citrulline, the coproduct of nitric oxide synthesis, and this, as well as cell death and neuronal loss, is abolished by antagonists of glutamate receptors and by L-NAME. Finally, poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) knock-out mice appear to be protected from monocular deprivation-induced cell death.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

From the earliest detectable development of fetal pituitary- thyroid function (day 18-19 of gestation) through the first postnatal day, there was a higher degree of stimulation of the pituitary- thyroid axis in the fetuses of rats fed a low iodine diet (LID) than in those of rats fed a high iodine diet (HID). Significant differences between the two groups were consistently observed in relative thyroid size, plasma TSH, 4-h thyroid radioiodine uptake, and the labeled iodoamino acid composition of thyroid digests. Plasma T4 concentration was lower in both LID and HID fetuses and pups than in the HID mothers. Plasma T3 was not detectable (less than 20 ng/dl) in the fetuses of either group, nor was labeled T3 in the thyroid digests. Body weight, plasma T4, and pituitary TSH content were usually lower in the LID than the HID animals of comparable age; however, these differences were not consistently statistically significant (P less than 0.05).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Activation of the renal kallikrein-kinin system results in natriuresis and diuresis, suggesting its possible role in renal tubular sodium transport regulation. Here, we used patch-clamp electrophysiology to directly assess the effects of bradykinin ( BK ) on the epithelial Na(+) channel ( ENaC ) activity in freshly isolated split-opened murine aldosterone-sensitive distal nephrons (ASDNs). BK acutely inhibits ENaC activity by reducing channel open probability (P(o)) in a dose-dependent and reversible manner. Inhibition of B2 receptors with icatibant (HOE-140) abolished BK actions on ENaC. In contrast, activation of B1 receptors with the selective agonist Lys-des-Arg(9)- BK failed to reproduce BK actions on ENaC. This is consistent with B2 receptors playing a critical role in mediating BK signaling to ENaC. BK has little effect on ENaC P(o) when G(q/11) was inhibited with Gp antagonist 2A. Moreover, inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) with U73122, but not saturation of cellular cAMP levels with the membrane-permeable nonhydrolysable cAMP analog 8-cpt-cAMP, prevents BK actions on ENaC activity. This argues that BK stimulates B2 receptors with subsequent activation of G(q/11)-PLC signaling cascade to acutely inhibit ENaC activity. Activation of BK signaling acutely depletes apical PI(4,5)P(2) levels. However, inhibition of Ca(2+) pump SERCA of the endoplasmic reticulum with thapsigargin does not prevent BK signaling to ENaC.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Previous studies showed that platelets from patients with uremia have a marked decrease in their aggregation response to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and collagen as single agents or as a pair. It is known that small amounts of arachidonic acid can enhance the sensitivity of platelets to concentrations of ADP or collagen that do not cause aggregation when used singly. Stimulation of platelets by certain agonists induces the formation of fibrinogen receptors on the platelet surface. The binding of fibrinogen that follows is essential for platelet aggregation. The platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex appears to be the site of the fibrinogen receptor. Therefore, we investigated the binding of iodine 125-labeled fibrinogen to uremic platelets exposed to ADP, collagen, or arachidonic acid as single agents and as pairs. When aggregation and binding were studied in response to ADP, collagen, or the combination of ADP with collagen, uremic platelets had reduced aggregation and bound abnormally low amounts of fibrinogen. In contrast, platelets from patients with uremia bound as much 125I- fibrinogen and aggregated as well as controls when ADP or collagen were used in combination with low concentrations of arachidonic acid. Studies with a monoclonal antibody (B 79.7) suggested that the number of glycoprotein IIb-IIa molecules is the same in uremic and normal platelets.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Porcine circovirus type 2 ( PCV2 ) is recognized as the causative agent of porcine circovirus-associated diseases. PCV2 replication could be promoted by low doses of ochratoxin A (OTA) as in our previous study and selenium has been shown to attenuate PCV2 replication. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of selenomethionine (SeMet), the major component of organic selenium, on OTA-induced PCV2 replication promotion and its potential mechanism. The present study demonstrates that OTA could promote PCV2 replication as measured by cap protein expression, viral titer, viral DNA copies and the number of infected cells. In addition, OTA could activate autophagy as indicated by up-regulated light chain 3 (LC3)-II and autophagy -related protein 5 expressions and autophagosome formation. Further, OTA could down-regulate p-AKT and p-mTOR expressions and OTA-induced autophagy was inhibited when insulin was applied. SeMet at 2, 4 and 6 M had significant inhibiting effects against OTA-induced PCV2 replication promotion. Furthermore, SeMet could attenuate OTA-induced autophagy and up-regulate OTA-induced p-AKT and p-mTOR expression inhibition. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of AKT/mTOR, could reverse the effects of SeMet on OTA-induced autophagy and the PCV2 replication promotion.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The authors examined whether the blockage of angiotensin II receptors by irbesartan ( IRB ) can reverse the "non-dipper" circadian rhythm of blood pressure ( BP ) to a "dipper" pattern in black salt-sensitive hypertensive patients submitted to a high-sodium loading. Twelve black salt-sensitive hypertensive patients (seven men; age, 35-58 years) on a high-sodium diet (300 mmol Na+ per day) were followed for 8 weeks. A placebo was given during the first 2 weeks, followed by 2 weeks on IRB 150 mg/d, 2 weeks on placebo, and 2 weeks on IRB 300 mg/d. On the last day of placebo, IRB 150 mg/d, and IRB 300 mg/d treatments, 24-hour BP and urinary 24-hour excretion of Na+ and potassium were measured. On placebo, ambulatory mean arterial pressure (MAP) was 112 mm Hg+/-2 (24 h), 112 mm Hg+/-2 (daytime), and 111 mm Hg+/-2 (nighttime), showing a clear circadian non-dipper profile.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) is an incurable disease characterized by a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance leading to right heart failure. Carbon monoxide ( CO ) has emerged as a potently protective, homeostatic molecule that prevents the development of vascular disorders when administered prophylactically. The data presented in this paper demonstrate that CO can also act as a therapeutic (i.e., where exposure to CO is initiated after pathology is established). In three rodent models of PAH, a 1 hour/day exposure to CO reverses established PAH and right ventricular hypertrophy, restoring right ventricular and pulmonary arterial pressures, as well as the pulmonary vascular architecture, to near normal. The ability of CO to reverse PAH requires functional endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS/NOS3) and NO generation, as indicated by the inability of CO to reverse chronic hypoxia-induced PAH in eNOS-deficient (nos3-/-) mice versus wild-type mice. The restorative function of CO was associated with a simultaneous increase in apoptosis and decrease in cellular proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, which was regulated in part by the endothelial cells in the hypertrophied vessels.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Binding of bacterial LPS to the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) complex of inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells plays a central role in recognition of ascending bacterial infections and activation of proinflammatory responses. Since proinflammatory cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is induced in IMCD cells upon LPS exposure, the present study addressed the question of whether TLR4 mediates COX-2 induction in IMCD cells and characterized the underlying signaling mechanisms. Enhanced COX-2 expression and activity in the presence of LPS was diminished by TLR4 inhibition. LPS induced a TLR4-dependent stimulation of NF-B and the MAPKs p38, ERK1/2, and JNK. Activation of NF-B was under negative control of JNK, as inhibition of JNK increased NF-B activity and COX-2 expression. Phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 required TLR4-dependent release of TGF- with subsequent activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ), whereas JNK activation was EGFR independent. Inhibition of p38 or ERK1/2 had no significant effect on LPS-induced NF-B activation, nor on activator protein 1-, cAMP response element-, or serum response element-driven reporter constructs. However, the transcriptional regulator SP-1 appears to contribute to COX-2 expression after LPS exposure.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Clinical trials revealed that estrogen may result in cardiovascular risk in patients with coronary heart disease, despite earlier studies demonstrating that estrogen provided cardiovascular protection. It is possible that the preexisting condition of hypertension and the ability of estrogen to activate the renin-angiotensin system could confound its beneficial effects. Our hypothesis is that the attenuation of estrogen to agonist-induced vasoconstrictor responses through the activation of nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) is impaired by hypertension. We investigated the effects of 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) replacement in normotensive Sprague-Dawley (SD) and (mRen2)27 hypertensive transgenic (TG) rats on contractile responses to three vasoconstrictors, angiotensin II (ANG II), serotonin ( 5-HT ), and phenylephrine (PE), and on the modulatory role of vascular NO to these responses. The aorta was isolated from ovariectomized SD and TG rats treated chronically with 5 mg E(2) or placebo (P). The isometric tension of the aortic rings was measured in organ chambers, and endothelial NOS (eNOS) in the rat aorta was detected using Western blot analysis. E(2) treatment increased eNOS expression in the SD and TG aorta and reduced ANG II- and 5-HT - but not PE-induced contractions in SD and TG rats. The inhibition of NOS with N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester enhanced ANG II-, 5-HT -, and PE-induced contractions in P-treated and ANG II and PE responses in E(2)-treated SD and TG rats. Only the responses to 5-HT were augmented in hypertensive rats.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

These cells, which luteinize in culture, were harvested from 6-mm or greater diameter follicles and cultured in the presence of 1% fetal calf serum and 1 microgram/mL insulin for 48 h. On the third day, the media were replaced with fresh serum-free media, with the same dose of insulin, and on the following day (day 4) the media were replaced with serum- and insulin-free media. At this time (day 4) hCG was added to some cultures. On day 5, cells from the group with hCG and cells from the group without hCG were treated with graded doses of ovine PRL (0.1-3.0 micrograms/mL). To a second set of cells, likewise treated, 100 micrograms of porcine low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) was added. Two days later (day 7) media were sampled and replaced with media alone or media containing hormones and (or) LDL. On day 9 cultures were terminated.

Plants growing in dense stands may not equally acquire or utilize extra carbon gained in elevated CO (2). As a result, reproductive differences between dominant and subordinate plants may be altered under rising CO (2) conditions. We hypothesized that elevated CO (2) would enhance the reproductive allocation of shaded, subordinate Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. (Asteraceae) individuals more than that of light-saturated dominants. We grew stands of A. artemisiifolia at either 360 or 720 muL L(-1) CO (2) levels and measured the growth and reproductive responses of competing individuals. To test whether elevated CO (2) altered size and reproductive inequalities within stands, we compared stand-level coefficients of variation (CV) in height growth and final shoot, root, and reproductive organ biomasses. Elevated CO (2) enhanced biomass and reduced the CV for all aspects of plant growth, especially reproductive biomass. Allocation to reproduction was higher in the elevated CO (2) than in the ambient treatment, and this difference was more pronounced in small, rather than large plant positive relationships between the CV and total stand productivity declined under elevated CO (2), indicating that growth enhancements to smaller plants diminished the relative biomass advantages of larger plants in increasingly crowded conditions.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
We conclude that elevated <el> CO <le>(2) stimulates stand-level <re> reproduction <er> while <el> CO <le>(2)-induced growth gains of subordinate A. artemisiifolia plants minimize differences in the reproductive output of small and large plants. positive----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

We have studied the effect of protein kinase C and protein kinase A activation, and phosphatase inhibition on two different stimuli with distinct mechanisms of action. The first stimulus is compound 48/80, and its action is mediated probably by a Gi-protein, while the other is sodium fluoride, which unspecifically activates G-proteins. We established a comparative study because the action of compound 48/80 is calcium -independent, while fluoride is strictly calcium -dependent. The activation of protein kinase C was attained with the phorbol esther 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, protein kinase A was activated by increasing cAMP levels with forskolin or rolipram, and the phosphatase activity was inhibited with okadaic acid ( OA ), which inhibits phosphatases type 1 and 2A.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Binding of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope protein E2 to CD81 provides a costimulatory signal for human T cells. This phenomenon may play a role in liver damage and autoimmune manifestations associated with HCV infection. Here we show that cross-linking of CD81 by HCV E2 induced a calcium flux in T cells that depends on Lck since it was blocked by PP1 and absent in Lck -deficient Jurkat T cells. In wild-type Jurkat cells, Lck was activated by CD81 cross-linking, and CD81, like Lck, was found in lipid rafts. Indeed, the integrity of the raft compartment was required for the induction of a calcium flux by E2, since methyl-beta-cyclodextrin abolished this response. A requirement for TCR/CD3 expression was indicated by the absence of a calcium flux following E2 stimulation of TCR/CD3-deficient Jurkat cells. CD81 cross-linking increased and prolonged the anti-CD3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of TCR1 and of other proteins, indicating that the CD81 -mediated signal converges with the TCR/CD3 signaling cascade at its most upstream step.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Cholangiocarcinoma is a highly-malignant adenocarcinoma originating from cholangiocytes. Current concepts support escape from immune surveillance using aberrant expression of Fas ligand ( FasL ) and dysregulation of receptor (FasR) signaling as a potential mechanism for tumor progression. Our aims were to determine if altered expression of FasR and FasL or changes in expression of FLICE inhibitor (I-FLICE) allow cholangiocarcinoma cells to escape immune surveillance. Human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines were evaluated for the functional expression of FasR and FasL by (1) quantitating apoptosis after incubation of cells with agonistic antibodies and (2) an in vitro cell death assay involving coculture of cholangiocarcinoma cells with Fas-sensitive thymocytes. I-FLICE antisense treatment was performed by stable transfection with complementary DNA (cDNA) for I-FLICE in the reverse orientation. We found that normal cholangiocytes in vivo express FasL. Human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines express both FasL and FasR and I-FLICE. FasL expressed by cholangiocarcinomas in vitro induced lymphocyte cell death (70% after 24 hours). Despite the expression of FasR, exposure of the cells to agonistic antibodies (500 ng/mL) induced only minimal apoptosis in the Jurkat cells. Antisense treatment of cholangiocarcinomas in vitro with I-FLICE reduced protein expression of I-FLICE by 90% to 95% and increased Fas-mediated apoptosis 2-fold.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Angiotensin II (AngII) plays a crucial role in the control of aldosterone biosynthesis in adrenal glomerulosa cells through the stimulation of two distinct Ca2+ entry pathways: (1) opening of voltage-operated calcium channels, and (2) activation of a capacitative Ca2+ entry that is dependent on calcium release from intracellular pools. Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), on the other hand, a major hormonal regulator of steroidogenesis, induces an increase in intracellular cAMP through the activation of a G-protein-coupled adenylyl cyclase. Recent studies have demonstrated that the rise in cAMP induced by ACTH can be potentiated by AngII in bovine glomerulosa cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanism of AngII action on ACTH-induced cAMP production. In primary cultures of bovine glomerulosa cells, we found that AngII (100 nM), which had no effect by itself on cAMP production, significantly potentiated maximal ACTH-induced cAMP formation in the presence of extracellular calcium (1.2 mM). In contrast, in the absence of extracellular calcium, AngII did not affect ACTH-induced cAMP production. These results suggest that calcium entry into the cell plays an important role in the activation of the cyclase by AngII. The inhibition of voltage-operated calcium channels by nicardipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist blocking both low-threshold (T-type) and high-threshold (L-type) Ca2+ channels, did not significantly affect the potentiating effect of AngII.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Ezetimibe is usually dosed daily, but its 22-hour elimination half-life permits significant cholesterol reduction with less frequent dosing. The aim of this study was to examine lipid changes in 33 patients treated with thrice-weekly ezetimibe for > or =1 month, who had pre- and postezetimibe lipid levels and no other concurrent changes in their lipid treatment. Ninety-four percent of the patients were treated with ezetimibe because they experienced myalgias, elevated transaminase levels, or gastrointestinal intolerance with higher doses of other lipid-lowering agents.

We tested the hypothesis that dexmedetomidine used for sedation alters the convulsive potency of racemic bupivacaine and levobupivacaine in awake, spontaneously breathing rats. In the first experiments, male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups: bupivacaine with no dexmedetomidine ( bupivacaine control; BC), bupivacaine with small-dose dexmedetomidine (BS), bupivacaine with large-dose dexmedetomidine (BL), levobupivacaine with no dexmedetomidine (levobupivacaine control; LC), levobupivacaine with small-dose dexmedetomidine (LS), and levobupivacaine with large-dose dexmedetomidine (LL) (n = 10 for each group).

5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside ( AICA riboside; Acadesine) activates AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) in intact cells, and is reported to exert protective effects in the mammalian CNS. In rat cerebrocortical brain slices, AMPK was activated by metabolic stress (ischaemia > hypoxia > aglycaemia) and AICA riboside (0.1-10 mm). Activation of AMPK by AICA riboside was greatly attenuated by inhibitors of equilibrative nucleoside transport. AICA riboside also depressed excitatory synaptic transmission in area CA1 of the rat hippocampus, which was prevented by an adenosine A1 receptor antagonist and reversed by application of adenosine deaminase.

Previously we showed that lysates of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli ( EPEC ) inhibit lymphokine production by mitogen-activated human peripheral blood and lamina propria mononuclear cells. The aims of the present study were to determine whether EPEC -inhibitory factors have similar effects on murine lymphoid populations in order to further delineate the mechanisms of alteration of cytokine production. Preexposure to EPEC lysates inhibited mitogen-stimulated interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) production by murine spleen cells, but IL-10 production was increased. The inhibition was not due to increased apoptosis and was not blocked by neutralizating antibodies against IL-10 or transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). EPEC lysates also inhibited mitogen-stimulated IL-2 and IFN-gamma production by CD11b-depleted spleen cells, IL-2 and IL-4 production by intraepithelial and Peyer's patch lymphocytes, IL-2 production by the human T-cell line Jurkat, and antigen-stimulated IL-2 production by murine spleen cells.

Insulin and platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) are mitogenic for murine 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. Both these mitogens acutely stimulate glucose transport by 2-4-fold in these cells, evident within minutes of agonist exposure. The tumour promoter and protein kinase C activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) also stimulates glucose transport by 2-3-fold over a similar time frame, suggesting that protein kinase C may be involved in the mitogenic action of insulin and PDGF in this cell line. In an attempt to address this, we have measured intracellular sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) levels in response to insulin, PDGF and PMA. We show that PDGF and PMA induce a rapid elevation in intracellular diacylglycerol levels, but insulin was without effect.

Ten day old Sprague-Dawley rat pups (n=157) were subjected to unilateral carotid artery ligation followed by 2.5h of hypoxia or sham surgery. HI animals received control siRNA, GSK-3 siRNA (4 L/pup), G-CSF (50 g/kg), G-CSF combined with 0.1 or 0.4 nM G-CSF receptor ( G-CSF R) siRNA, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor Wortmannin (86 ng/pup), or DMSO (vehicle for Wortmannin).

Malignant melanoma has the highest malignancy rate among all skin cancer and is characterized by an insidious onset, high invasion and poor patient prognosis. Yet, the mechanisms involved remain unclear and warrant further investigation. Based on bioinformatic analysis, phospholipase C 2 ( PLCB2 ) has been found to be correlated with melanoma growth. The present study was the first to demonstrate that PLCB2 is a key factor affecting melanoma proliferation and apoptosis. Here, microarray datasets from the publicly available Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were employed, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was introduced to identify candidate transcription factors. PLCB2 was identified as a crucial gene in the proteinprotein interaction (PPI) network.

In the present study, we investigate the effects of FA on the activities and gene expression of glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1 and 2, catalase (CAT), nitric oxide synthase (iNOS and cNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX) 1 and 2.

For experiments, male Wistar rats were submitted to FA inhalation (1%, 90 min daily) for 3 consecutive days. The treatments with apocynin and indomethacin before the FA exposure reduced the number of neutrophils recruited into the lung. Moreover, the treatments with apocynin and indomethacin blunted the effect of FA on the generation of IL-1, while the treatments with L-NAME and apocynin reduced the generation of IL-6 by lung explants when compared to the untreated group. FA inhalation increased the levels of NO and hydrogen peroxide by BAL cells cultured and the treatments with apocynin and l-NAME reduced these generations.

These studies were designed to determine the role of the central nervous system, the sympathetic nervous system, the adrenal glands and the renal sympathetic nerves in yohimbine -induced renin release in conscious rats. Yohimbine (0.3-10 mg/kg, s.c.) caused time- and dose-related increases in plasma renin activity (PRA) and concentration (PRC) which were accompanied by time- and dose-related elevations of plasma norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (Epi) concentrations. Significant positive correlations were found between the increases in PRA and the increases in plasma NE and Epi concentrations caused by yohimbine, and propranolol (1.5 mg/kg, s.c.) blocked 90% of yohimbine (3 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced renin release. Over the entire spectrum of doses of yohimbine, the increases in PRA and plasma NE and Epi concentrations were positively correlated with the decreases in mean arterial pressure (MAP), but the y-intercept was positive in every case and the 1 mg/kg dose of yohimbine consistently increased PRA independent of any change in MAP. Complete renal denervation, as evidenced by a greater than 90% reduction in renal NE content, did not alter the increase in PRA caused by yohimbine (3 mg/kg, s.c.). An increase in circulating plasma catecholamine concentrations appeared to mediate yohimbine -induced renin release since propranolol prevented the rise in PRA caused by yohimbine in renal denervated rats. Prior adrenalectomy (Adx) also failed to prevent the rise in PRA produced by yohimbine (3 mg/kg, s.c.), but a combination of Adx and renal denervation caused a significant impairment of yohimbine -induced renin release.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Eight patients who developed pulmonary artery hypertension during the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were treated with an infusion of prostacyclin ( PGI2, 12.5-35.0 ng.kg-1.min-1) for 45 min. We examined whether reducing the right ventricular (RV) outflow pressures by PGI2 infusion would increase the right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) measured by thermodilution. PGI2 reduced the pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) from 35.6 to 29.1 mmHg (p less than 0.01). The cardiac index ( CI ) increased from 4.2 to 5.81.min-1.m-2 (p less than 0.01) partly due to an increased stroke volume. The decreased PAP together with the increased CI resulted in a fall of the calculated pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI, from 5.1 to 2.5 mmHg.min.m2.1-1, p less than 0.01). In the patients with subnormal baseline RVEF the increased stroke volume was associated with an increased RVEF (from 47.6% to 51.8%, p less than 0.05) suggesting improved RV function. This result was underscored by a significant relationship between the changes in PVRI and RVEF (r = 0.789, delta % RVEF = 2.11.delta PVRI-1.45). Despite an increased venous admixture from 27.8% to 36.9% (p less than 0.05) the arterial PO2 remained constant resulting in an increased oxygen delivery from 657 to 894 ml.min-1.m-2 (p less than 0.01).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

In SHR, losartan and PD-123319 partially inhibited angiotensin II -induced VSMC proliferation. The mitogen-activated protein kinase or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) kinase inhibitor PD-98059 blocked VSMC growth responses to angiotensin II in both strains. Angiotensin II increased ERK1/2 activation more in SHR than WKY, an effect inhibited by losartan but not PD-123319. LY-294002 [a phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI3) kinase inhibitor] blocked angiotensin II -stimulated ERK1/2 activation in SHR but not in WKY, whereas bisindolylmaleimide [a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor] was ineffective.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

In vitro and in vivo techniques were developed with genetically modified mice to determine whether endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) functions as an O(2) mediator in closure of the ductus arteriosus ( DA ) at birth. Wild-type CD-1 and 129/SvEv mice with ET(A) receptor -/-, +/-, and +/+ genotypes were used. Isolated DA from term ET(A) +/+ fetuses contracted to O(2) (5-95%) and a thromboxane A(2) analog (ONO-11113, 0.1 microM). Instead, ET-1 elicited a dual response with weak relaxation (0.1 nM) preceding contraction (1-100 nM). Indomethacin (2.8 microM) was also a constrictor. ET(A) -/- DA, unlike ET(A) +/+ DA, contracted marginally to O(2) and ET-1 but responded to ONO-11113. O(2) contraction was also reduced in ET(A) +/- DA. In vivo, DA constricted equally in tracheotomized ET(A) -/- and ET(A) +/+ newborns. Conversely, no DA constriction was seen in hyperoxic ET(A) -/- fetuses in utero, although it occurred in ET(A) +/+ and +/- littermates.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Hippocampal theta rhythm ( HPCtheta ) may be important for various phenomena, including attention and acquisition of sensory information. Two types of HPCtheta (types I and II) exist based on pharmacological, behavioral, and electrophysiological characteristics. Both types occur during locomotion, whereas only type II (atropine-sensitive) is present under urethane anesthesia. The circuit of HPCtheta synchronization includes the medial septum-diagonal band of Broca ( MSDB ), with cholinergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons comprising the two main projections from MSDB to HPC. The primary aim of the present study was to assess the effects of GABAergic MSDB lesions on urethane- and locomotion-related HPCtheta, and compare these effects to those of cholinergic MSDB lesions. Saline, kainic acid (KA), or 192 IgG-saporin (SAP) was injected into MSDB before recording. KA preferentially destroys GABAergic MSDB neurons, whereas SAP selectively eliminates cholinergic MSDB neurons. A fixed recording electrode was placed in the dentate mid-molecular layer, and stimulating electrodes were placed in the posterior hypothalamus (PH), and medial perforant path (PP). Under urethane anesthesia, HPCtheta was induced by tail pinch, PH stimulation, and systemic physostigmine; none of the rats with KA or SAP showed HPCtheta in any of these conditions. During locomotion, HPCtheta was attenuated, but not eliminated, in rats with KA or SAP lesions. Intraseptal KA in combination with either intraseptal SAP or PP lesions reduced locomotion-related HPCtheta beyond that observed with each lesion alone, virtually eliminating HPCtheta.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The cell adhesion molecule Thy-1 (CD90) mediates the adhesion of melanoma cells to activated human endothelial cells (EC) via the interaction with the v3-integrin on the tumor cells in vitro. Here, we report a strong expression of Thy-1 on both blood vessel and lymphatic EC in melanoma and melanoma metastases. Vascular endothelial growth factor and tumor necrosis factor- were identified as inducers of Thy-1 expression on EC in vitro. The physiological role of Thy-1 for lymphogenic and hematogenic metastasis of melanoma cells was substantiated in an experimental metastasis model using B16/F10 melanoma cells. Mice lacking Thy-1 showed markedly diminished experimental lung metastasis after injection of B16/F10 melanoma cells compared to wild-type littermate controls. In addition, on generation of a primary subcutaneous tumor, metastasis to regional lymph nodes was clearly reduced in Thy-1 (-/-) mice.

The effects of eicosapentaenoic acid on synthesis and secretion of cholesterol and cholesterol ester by cultured rat hepatocytes were studied. In the presence of eicosapentaenoic acid cellular cholesterol esterification was decreased by 50-75% compared to oleic acid as measured by radioactive precursors and mass. Secretion of cholesterol ester was reduced by 50-60% in the presence of eicosapentaenoic acid as evaluated by radiolabeled fatty acids, mevalonolactone, and mass measurement. Oleic, palmitic, and stearic acid increased, whereas eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid decreased synthesis and secretion of cholesterol ester as compared to a fatty acid-free control. Cellular and secreted free cholesterol were unaffected by eicosapentaenoic acid in comparison with oleic acid. The reduced cholesterol esterification was observed within 1 h and lasted for at least 20 h. Eicosapentaenoic acid caused lower cholesterol esterification than oleic acid in the concentration range 0.2-1.0 mM fatty acid and reduced the stimulatory effect of oleic acid on cholesterol ester formation. Cholesterol esterification and release of cholesterol ester were markedly increased by 25-hydroxycholesterol in the presence of eicosapentaenoic acid as well as oleic acid.

Intermittent hypoxia ( IH ) resulting from sleep apnea can lead to pulmonary hypertension. IH causes oxidative stress that may limit bioavailability of the endothelium-derived vasodilator nitric oxide ( NO ) and thus contribute to this hypertensive response. We therefore hypothesized that increased vascular superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) generation reduces NO -dependent pulmonary vasodilation following IH. To test this hypothesis, we examined effects of the O(2)(-) scavenger tiron on vasodilatory responses to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator ionomycin and the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine in isolated lungs from hypocapnic- IH (H- IH ; 3 min cycles of 5% O(2)/air flush, 7 h/day, 4 wk), eucapnic- IH (E- IH ; cycles of 5% O(2), 5% CO(2)/air flush), and sham-treated (air/air cycled) rats. Next, we assessed effects of endogenous O(2)(-) on NO - and cGMP-dependent vasoreactivity and measured O(2)(-) levels using the fluorescent indicator dihydroethidium (DHE) in isolated, endothelium-disrupted small pulmonary arteries from each group. Both E- IH and H- IH augmented NO -dependent vasodilation; however, enhanced vascular smooth muscle (VSM) reactivity to NO following H- IH was masked by an effect of endogenous O(2)(-). Furthermore, H- IH and E- IH similarly increased VSM sensitivity to cGMP, but this response was independent of either O(2)(-) generation or altered arterial protein kinase G expression.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients on antiretroviral drug therapy frequently experience hepatotoxicity, the underlying mechanism of which is poorly understood. Hepatotoxicity from other compounds such as bosentan and troglitazone has been attributed, in part, to inhibition of hepatocyte bile acid excretion. This work tested the hypothesis that antiretroviral drugs modulate hepatic bile acid transport. Ritonavir (28 microM), saquinavir (15 microM), and efavirenz (32 microM) inhibited [(3)H] taurocholate transport in bile salt export pump expressing Sf9-derived membrane vesicles by 90, 71, and 33%, respectively. In sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes, the biliary excretion index (BEI) of [(3)H] taurocholate was maximally decreased 59% by ritonavir, 39% by saquinavir, and 20% by efavirenz. Likewise, in sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes, the BEI of [(3)H] taurocholate was decreased 100% by ritonavir and 94% by saquinavir. Sodium-dependent and -independent initial uptake rates of [(3)H] taurocholate in suspended rat hepatocytes were significantly decreased by ritonavir, saquinavir, and efavirenz. [(3)H]Taurocholate transport by recombinant NTCP and Ntcp was inhibited by ritonavir (IC(50) = 2.1 and 6.4 microM in human and rat, respectively), saquinavir (IC(50) = 6.7 and 20 microM, respectively), and efavirenz (IC(50) = 43 and 97 microM, respectively).

1. Dexrazoxane ( DXR, ICRF-187) has been shown both in animal studies and clinical trials to provide a substantial cardioprotection when co-administered with anthracycline drugs like Doxorubicin (DOX). In a previous study, we showed that chronic DOX treatment in rats is associated with a clear impairment of the crossbridge kinetics and shift in myosin iso-enzymes. 2. The present study was adopted to investigate whether the cardioprotective action of DXR involves preservation of the normal actin- myosin interaction. Rats were treated for 4 weeks with either DOX at a weekly dose of 2 mg kg(-1) (i.v. ), or were pre-injected with DXR (40 mg kg(-1), i.v.) at a 20 : 1 dose ratio 30 min prior to the DOX infusion. Rats receiving saline or DXR alone were included in the experiments. Cardiac trabeculae were isolated 4 weeks after the last infusion and were skinned with detergent. 3. Crossbridge turnover kinetics were studied after application of rapid length perturbations of varying amplitudes in Ca(2+)-activated preparations. DXR treatment offered a significant protection against the DOX-induced impairment of the crossbridge kinetics in isolated cardiac trabeculae. Time constants describing transitions between different crossbridge states were restored to normal in both the quick release protocol and the slack-test. DXR prevented the shift from the 'high ATPase' alpha- myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform towards the 'low-ATPase' beta-MHC isoform in the ventricles. 4.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

To investigate the pathophysiological sequelae of sleep -disordered breathing ( SDB ), we have developed a mouse model in which hypoxia was induced during periods of sleep and was removed in response to arousal or wakefulness. An on-line sleep -wake detection system, based on the frequency and amplitude of electroencephalograph and electromyograph recordings, served to trigger intermittent hypoxia during periods of sleep. In adult male C57BL/6J mice (n = 5), the sleep -wake detection system accurately assessed wakefulness (97.2 +/- 1.1%), non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (96.0 +/- 0.9%) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (85.6 +/- 5.0%). After 5 consecutive days of SDB, 554 +/- 29 (SE) hypoxic events were recorded over a 24-h period at a rate of 63.6 +/- 2.6 events/h of sleep and with a duration of 28.2 +/- 0.7 s. The mean nadir of fraction of inspired O(2) (FI(O(2))) on day 5 was 13.2 +/- 0.1%, and 137.1 +/- 13.2 of the events had a nadir FI(O(2)) 10% O(2).

Receptors for epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) have been demonstrated in the distal tubule. To determine whether there are acute functional correlates, we studied the effect of EGF on cortical collecting tubule (CCT) transepithelial voltage and transport of sodium and bicarbonate. Rabbit CCT were perfused in vitro and EGF was added to either the bathing medium or the luminal perfusate after base-line measurements of transport. Peritubular EGF in concentrations of 0.1 to 100 ng/ml (1.7 X 10(-11) to 1.7 X 10(-8) M) decreased sodium reabsorption, measured as 22Na absorption from the lumen, by 44-59%. There was a corresponding fall in the lumen-negative transepithelial voltage. Lower doses of EGF were without effect on transepithelial voltage or sodium transport. Pretreatment of the tubules with ouabain eliminated the effect of EGF on sodium transport. In contrast to peritubular EGF, luminal EGF (100 ng/ml) did not affect sodium transport. Peritubular EGF had no effect on either bicarbonate secretion or net bicarbonate transport in the CCT and no effect on net bicarbonate reabsorption in the medullary collecting tubule. Using the pH sensitive, fluorescent dye 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein, no change in principal cell intracellular pH was found after peritubular EGF.

The effects of GABA, the analogues muscimol and baclofen, and the antagonist bicuculline were investigated on cultured primary bovine lactotrophs using the patch clamp technique. Under voltage clamp in the whole cell mode using solutions containing chloride as the only permeable ion, GABA application increased the amplitude of mean membrane current and fluctuations of current about this mean. Statistical analysis of current fluctuations induced by GABA showed that the power density spectra in 8 of 12 cells were best fitted to double Lorentzian functions and the variance was smallest around the estimated equilibrium potential of chloride ions. The underlying channel open time estimated from noise analysis was only weakly voltage-dependent. The variance of current noise increased with GABA concentration within the range of 1-30 microM, although a slight decrease of variance in one cell could be observed at 30 microM, suggesting that desensitization to GABA might occur. Muscimol mimicked the effect of GABA but baclofen was without effect under these conditions. Bicuculline reduced the GABA -activated membrane current fluctuations. GABA - or muscimol-activated channels recorded in isolated outside-out patches had a slope conductance of about 20 pS.

The nicotine-derived nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone ( NNK ) induces lung adenocarcinoma through formation of DNA adducts. Our previous research on susceptibility to tobacco-induced carcinogenesis focused on benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE) as the in vitro mutagen for phenotype measurements of DNA repair capacity (DRC) in mammalian cells. Here, we present a modified host-cell reactivation (HCR) assay to measure lymphocytic DRC for alkylating DNA damage as is induced by the tobacco-specific nitrosamine, NNK. We substituted dimethyl sulfate (DMS) to create alkylating damage in pCMVluc plasmid DNA and established the damage-repair dose-response curves in both normal and nucleotide excision repair-deficient lymphoblastoid cell lines and in phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated primary lymphocytes. We then successfully measured the DRC in PHA-stimulated lymphocytes from 48 patients with lung adenocarcinoma and 45 cancer-free controls and tested our hypothesis that lower DRC for alkylating damage is associated with an increased risk of lung adenocarcinoma. The cases exhibited a lower mean DRC than did the controls. A >3-fold increased risk (odds ratio = 3.21; 95% confidence interval = 1.25-8.21) was found for those with DRC levels below the control median. There was no correlation between the DRC measured with this DMS-HCR assay and that from the parallel BPDE-HCR assay.

Human alpha- synuclein was identified on the basis of proteolytic fragments derived from senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease, and it is the locus of mutations in some familial forms of Parkinson's disease. Its normal function and whether it may play a direct role in neural degeneration remain unknown. To explore cellular responses to neural degeneration in the dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra, we have developed a rodent model of apoptotic death induced by developmental injury to their target, the striatum. We find by mRNA differential display that synuclein is up-regulated in this model, and thus it provides an opportunity to examine directly whether synuclein plays a role in the death of these neurons or, alternatively, in compensatory responses. Up-regulation of mRNA is associated with an increase in the number of neuronal profiles immunostained for synuclein protein. At a cellular level, synuclein is almost exclusively expressed in normal neurons, rather than apoptotic profiles. Synuclein is up-regulated throughout normal postnatal development of substantia nigra neurons, but it is not further up-regulated during periods of natural cell death.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Rats subjected to the glycerol model of MH-ARF were treated with (a) M; (b) DFO; (c) M + DFO; or (d) no protective agents. Relative degrees of protection (24-h plasma urea/creatinine concentrations) were M + DFO greater than M greater than DFO greater than or equal to no therapy. To assess whether catalytic Fe is generated during MH-ARF, the bleomycin assay was applied to plasma/urine samples obtained 0-2 h post-glycerol injection.

To assess the efficacy of cutaneous antisepsis to prevent catheter-associated infection, we prospectively studied three antiseptics for disinfection of patients' central venous and arterial catheter insertion sites in a surgical intensive care unit. 668 catheters were randomised to 10% povidone-iodine, 70% alcohol, or 2% aqueous chlorhexidine disinfection of the site before insertion and for site care every other day thereafter. Chlorhexidine was associated with the lowest incidence of local catheter-related infection (2.3 per 100 catheters vs 7.1 and 9.3 for alcohol and povidone-iodine, respectively, p = 0.02) and catheter-related bacteraemia (0.5 vs 2.3 and 2.6). Of the 14 infusion-related bacteraemias (4 due to contaminated infusate or catheter hub, 10 due to infected catheters), 1 was in the chlorhexidine group and 13 were in the other two groups (odds ratio 0.16, p = 0.04).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Thrombocytopenia is commonly observed during interferon -alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Since thrombopoietin (TPO) is the main regulator of thrombopoiesis, thrombocytopenia may partially be due to a reduced TPO generation. Because of the developments of the second generation of TPO mimetic drugs patients with reduced TPO level s should be identified possibly having a benefit by medicinal stimulation of thrombopoiesis. Therefore, platelet count and serum TPO concentration of patients receiving an interferon -alpha therapy were determined.Twelve patients treated with IFN-alpha (daily 10 x 106 IU s.c. for four weeks) in cause of chronic hepatitis C were examined during the first month of therapy. Serum TPO concentration significantly decreased from 80.8+/-48.0 to 34.6+/-24.5 pg/ml (p0.05, Mann-Whitney test), and platelet count declined from 214,417+/-48,292 to 151,333+/-44,726 platelets/microl.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Lomefloxacin is a difluorinated quinolone antibacterial drug. It is widely used against infectious diseases including meningitis, those of the genitourinary and upper respiratory tracts, and skin infections. Lomefloxacin, like other fluoroquinolones, is mutagenic and the formation of reactive oxygen species appears to be responsible for this genomic instability. The anti-mutagenic effects of naringin, a grapefruit flavonone, against lomefloxacin -induced genomic instability in vivo were evaluated in mouse bone marrow cells by chromosomal aberration and micronucleus (MN) assays. Naringin was neither genotoxic nor cytotoxic in mice at doses equivalent to 5 or 50 mg/kg. Pre-treatment of mice with naringin significantly reduced lomefloxacin -induced chromosomal aberrations and the MN formation in bone marrow. The protective effect of naringin was found to be stronger at the higher dose, indicating the dose-dependent effect of naringin. Lomefloxacin induced marked biochemical alterations characteristic of oxidative stress, including enhanced lipid peroxidation and reduction in the reduced glutathione level. Prior administration of naringin ahead of lomefloxacin challenge ameliorated these biochemical markers.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Recently it has been shown that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) preparations suppress the in vitro synthesis of IgG, IgA, and IgM. In this paper we demonstrate that IVIG and IgG purified from a single donor's serum also suppress the in vitro synthesis of IgE. We had noticed this effect when we added human serum (HS) to in vitro cultures for IgE synthesis. The interleukin-4 (IL-4)-induced IgE synthesis from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in the presence of fetal calf serum (FCS) was suppressed by HS in a dose-dependent fashion. The following results indicate that this suppression is mediated by IgG : (1) IVIG preparations, which consist mainly of IgG, suppressed the IgE synthesis from IL-4-stimulated PBMC in a dose-dependent way; (2) when HS was fractionated by protein G sepharose or anti- IgG sepharose, the eluate fractions (containing IgG ), but not the effluent fractions (void of IgG ) suppressed IgE synthesis, whereas the opposite was found when HS was fractionated by FCS-coupled sepharose.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The purpose of the present study was to investigate cataract ogenesis and recovery of lens damage after in vivo close to threshold ultraviolet (UV)-B radiation around 300 nm. Eighty six-week-old albino Sprague-Dawley rats were familiarized to a rat restrainer five days prior to exposure. Groups of non-anesthetized rats were exposed unilaterally to 8 kJ/m(2) UVR -300 nm. The animals were sacrificed at 1, 7, 48 and 336h following exposure. The lenses were extracted for imaging of dark-field lens macro anatomy and measurement of intensity of forward lens light scattering to quantify lens opacities. Three exposed lenses and one non-exposed lens from each time interval were examined with light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Macro anatomy and lens light scattering revealed that all contralateral non-exposed lenses were clear. The degree of lens opacity (difference in lens light scattering between exposed and non-exposed lenses) increased during the 336h, reaching a plateau towards the end of the observation period. Light microscopy and TEM demonstrated that apoptotic features appeared in the epithelium already 1h after UVR exposure, and small vacuoles were seen in the outer cortex. Epithelial damage occurs during the first 48h after exposure and is followed by regenerative repair at 336h post-exposure. Apoptotic epithelial cells were phagocytized by adjacent epithelial cells. Cortical fiber cells exhibited increasing damage throughout the observation period without any clear repair after 336h.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

To explore the effect of sleep on hiccups, we studied eight patients aged 20-81 years, all males with chronic hiccups lasting 7 days to 7 years, by means of overnight polysomnography. The incidence of new bouts of hiccups and the likelihood of hiccups being present were both highest in wakefulness and became progressively lower through stages I-IV of slow wave sleep (SWS) to rapid eye movement sleep (REMS). There was a significant tendency for hiccups to disappear at sleep onset and REMS onset. Of all 21 bouts of hiccups that were observed to stop, 10/21 did so during an apnea or hypopnea. Frequency of hiccups within a bout slowed progressively from wakefulness through the stages of SWS to REMS. For the whole group, mean frequency decreased significantly from wakefulness [(25.6 +/- 12.1), (mean +/- SD)] to sleep onset or stage I (22.3 +/- 12.2). Sleep latency was increased from 8 +/- 16.3 minutes when hiccups were absent to 16.35 +/- 19.9 minutes when it was present. Sleep efficiency was poor because of long waking periods, and there were deficiencies of both SWS and REMS.

The pendrin /SLC26A4 Cl (-)/HCO(3)(-) exchanger, encoded by the PDS gene, is expressed in cortical collecting duct (CCD) non-A intercalated cells. Pendrin is essential for CCD bicarbonate secretion and is also involved in NaCl balance and blood pressure regulation. The intestinal peptide uroguanylin (UGN) is produced in response to oral salt load and can function as an "intestinal natriuretic hormone." We aimed to investigate whether UGN modulates pendrin activity and to explore the molecular mechanisms responsible for this modulation. Injection of UGN into mice resulted in decreased pendrin mRNA and protein expression in the kidney. UGN decreased endogenous pendrin mRNA levels in HEK293 cells. A 4.2-kb human PDS (hPDS) promoter sequence and consecutive 5' deletion products were cloned into luciferase reporter vectors and transiently transfected into HEK293 cells. Exposure of transfected cells to UGN decreased hPDS promoter activity. This UGN-induced effect on the hPDS promoter occurred within a 52-bp region encompassing a single heat shock element (HSE). The effect of UGN on the promoter was abolished when the HSE located between nt -1119 and -1115 was absent or was mutated. Furthermore, treatment of HEK293 cells with heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) small interfering RNA (siRNA) reversed the UGN-induced decrease in endogenous PDS mRNA level.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Genetic deficiency of the plasma phospholipid transfer protein ( PLTP ) in mice unexpectedly causes a substantial impairment in liver secretion of apolipoprotein-B (apoB), the major protein of atherogenic lipoproteins. To explore the mechanism, we examined the three known pathways for hepatic apoB secretory control, namely endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/proteasome-associated degradation (ERAD), post-ER pre-secretory proteolysis (PERPP), and receptor-mediated degradation, also known as re-uptake. First, we found that ERAD and cell surface re-uptake were not active in PLTP -null hepatocytes. Moreover, ER-to-Golgi blockade by brefeldin A, which enhances ERAD, equalized total apoB recovery from PLTP -null and wild-type cells, indicating that the relevant process occurs post-ER. Second, because PERPP can be stimulated by intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ), we examined hepatic redox status. Although we found previously that PLTP -null mice exhibit elevated plasma concentrations of vitamin E, a lipid anti-oxidant, we now discovered that their livers contain significantly less vitamin E and significantly more lipid peroxides than do livers of wild-type mice. Third, to establish a causal connection, the addition of vitamin E or treatment with an inhibitor of intracellular iron-dependent peroxidation, desferrioxamine, abolished the elevation in cellular ROS as well as the defect in apoB secretion from PLTP -null hepatocytes.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Thirteen animals [134 +/- 0.5 (SE) days gestation ] received systemic infusions of bET-1 (1.5 or 3.0 micrograms/min for 10 min via the superior vena cava), which increased systemic arterial pressure by 5.0 +/- 1.9 (P  0.01) and 13.9 +/- 1.8 mmHg (P  0.01), respectively. Pretreatment with 10 mg of phosphoramidon, an ET-1-converting enzyme inhibitor, blocked the hypertensive response to bET-1. Six animals (136 +/- 1.5 days gestation ) received intrapulmonary infusion of bET-1 (3.0 micrograms/min for 10 min via the left pulmonary artery), which increased pulmonary arterial pressure by 18.1 +/- 1.5 mmHg (P  0.01).

Apoptosis is modulated by extrinsic and intrinsic signaling pathways through the formation of the death receptor-mediated death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and the mitochondrial-derived apoptosome, respectively. Ino-C2-PAF, a novel synthetic phospholipid shows impressive antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing activity. Little is known about the signaling pathway through which it stimulates apoptosis. Here, we show that this drug induces apoptosis through proteins of the death receptor pathway, which leads to an activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Apoptosis induced by Ino-C2-PAF and its glucosidated derivate, Glc-PAF, was dependent on the DISC components FADD and caspase-8. This can be inhibited in FADD--/-- and caspase-8--/-- cells, in which the breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase-9, -8 and -3 do not occur. In addition, the overexpression of crmA, c-Flip or dominant negative FADD as well as treatment with the caspase-8 inhibitor z-IETD-fmk protected against Ino-C2-PAF-induced apoptosis. Apoptosis proceeds in the absence of CD95/ Fas -ligand expression and is independent of blockade of a putative death-ligand/receptor interaction. Furthermore, apoptosis cannot be inhibited in CD95/ Fas --/-- Jurkat cells. Expression of Bcl-2 in either the mitochondria or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) strongly inhibited Ino-C2-PAF- and Glc-PAF -induced apoptosis.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The factors regulating dendritic cell (DC) development and homeostasis are incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that DCs express the lymphotoxin ( LT )-beta receptor ( LT beta R) and that in mice lacking the LT beta R in hematopoietic cells, spleen, and lymph node, CD8- DC numbers are reduced. B cells are a key source of LT alpha 1 beta 2 for splenic DC homeostasis, and transgenic overexpression of LT alpha 1 beta 2 on B cells leads to expansion of the CD8- DC compartment. Furthermore, we find that about 5% of splenic DCs are undergoing cell division, and the number of dividing CD8- DCs is disproportionately reduced in the absence of the LT beta R. In parabiosis experiments, splenic DCs were only partially replaced by circulating precursors over a 6 week period.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

hCG has been reported to cause an inflammation -like effect in the testis, although the background and consequences of this phenomenon remain to be understood. This investigation reveals that a single injection of hCG (100 U) induces a transient surge in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the adult rat testis. Reverse transcriptase PCR analysis demonstrated onset of testicular expression of IL-1beta and IL-6 mRNA and increases in the levels of mRNA encoding the constitutively expressed cytokines IL-1alpha, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha 4 h after hCG injection and a maximal response after 8-12 h. These increases were accompanied by a transient increase in testicular IL-1 bioactive protein. Twenty-four hours after administration of hCG, the levels of all cytokine mRNA had decreased, although most were still elevated above control. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the IL-1beta protein was undetectable in normal testes but was seen to be localized to interstitial macrophages but not Leydig cells after hCG treatment.

Lafutidine is a new type of antiulcer drug, possessing both an antisecretory effect, exerted via a blockade of the histamine H2 receptor, and gastroprotective activity, mediated by capsaicin-sensitive afferent nerves (CSN). In the present study, we examined the effect of lafutidine on gastric mucosal blood flow ( GMBF ) and duodenal HCO3- secretion (DAS) under basal and acid-stimulated conditions in rats. Under urethane anesthesia, GMBF was measured using a laser Doppler flowmeter in a chambered stomach before and after exposure to 20 mM taurocholate (TC) plus 50 mM HCl, while DAS was measured in a proximal duodenal loop before and after mucosal acidification (10 mM HCl for 10 min) by titrating the perfusate at pH 7.0 using a pH-stat method and by adding 10 mM HCl. Lafutidine given intraperitoneally affected neither GMBF nor DAS under basal conditions, but augmented an increase in both GMBF and DAS induced by mucosal acidification. Although the acid-induced GMBF and DAS responses were significantly mitigated by both indomethacin and sensory deafferentation but not by ruthenium red (RT), the vanilloid receptor (VR)-1 antagonist, the responses were preserved in lafutidine -treated animals, even in the presence of indomethacin. Both GMBF and DAS were significantly increased by local application of capsaicin, the responses being attenuated by indomethacin and RT as well as sensory deafferentation.

Uptake of 18F-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) by the thigh muscle of an anesthetized rabbit was monitored by a single pair of coincidence photon detectors. Graphical analysis of tissue and plasma radioactivity concentrations was performed to derive fractional rates of FDG phosphorylation continuously. FDG phosphorylation rates were determined during rest (glucose 7 mM, insulin 5-10 microU/ml) and subsequent 5-min intervals under conditions of euglycemic hyperinsulinemia (glucose 6-8 mM; insulin 350-400 microU/ml plasma). FDG phosphorylation did not increase above resting control levels until 5.5 +/- 1.5 min after intravenous insulin administration. After 20-30 min of hyperinsulinemia, FDG phosphorylation and calculated glucose metabolic rates were increased by 50%.

NF-kappaB activation in bronchial epithelial cells is important for the development of allergic airway inflammation, and may control the expression of critical mediators of allergic inflammation such as thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and the chemokine CCL20. Members of the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) family of proteins are differentially expressed in tissue and help mediate NF-kappaB activity in response to numerous stimuli. Here we demonstrate that CARMA3 (CARD10) is specifically expressed in human airway epithelial cells, and that expression of CARMA3 in these cells leads to activation of NF-kappaB. CARMA3 has recently been shown to mediate NF-kappaB activation in embryonic fibroblasts after stimulation with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a bioactive lipid-mediator that is elevated in the lungs of individuals with asthma. Consistent with this, we demonstrate that stimulation of airway epithelial cells with LPA leads to increased expression of TSLP and CCL20.

Classical conditioning of the rabbit nictitating membrane response was accomplished by presenting a 100-msec tone CS at intervals 0, 100, 200, 400 and 800 msec before the presentation of a 100-msec shock UCS. In addition, tone-alone trials were used to monitor CR acquisition and shock-alone trials to measure facilitation of the nictitating membrane reflex by the tone CS at the various CS -UCS intervals. LSD at a dose of 13 micrograms/kg (30 nmol/kg) increased the excitatory effects of the shock UCS as measured by a greater frequency and amplitude of UCRs elicited across a wide range of UCS intensities and by the ability of a low intensity shock to produce reflex facilitation. Consequently, LSD produced a higher amplitude of UCRs on UCS-alone trials and on paired trials across all CS -UCS intervals during measurement of tone-induced reflex facilitation. LSD also enhanced CR acquisition across all CS -UCS intervals. Because LSD produced larger amplitude reference UCRs on the UCS-alone trials as compared with controls, calculations of reflex facilitation as a percentage change from these reference amplitudes led to an artifactually smaller effect for the LSD group as compared with controls. Nevertheless, both reflex facilitation as measured prior to CR acquisition on the first day of conditioning and CR acquisition across 10 conditioning sessions were a function of CS -UCS intervals and these two measures were highly correlated in the LSD (+0.94) and vehicle control (+0.85) groups.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis ( TWEAK ) regulates apoptosis, proliferation and inflammation in renal epithelial cells and plays a role in acute kidney injury. However, there is little information on the chronic effects of TWEAK. We hypothesized that TWEAK may influence renal fibrosis and regulate kidney fibroblast biology, in part, through Ras pathway. We studied a chronic model of experimental unilateral ureteral obstruction in wild type and TWEAK deficient mice, and a murine model of systemic TWEAK overexpression. TWEAK actions were also explored in cultured renal and embryonic fibroblasts. TWEAK and TWEAK receptor expression was increased in the obstructed kidneys. The absence of TWEAK decreased early kidney tubular damage, inflammatory infiltrates and myofibroblast number. TWEAK deficient mice had decreased renal fibrosis 21days after obstruction, as assessed by extracellular matrix staining. In mice without prior underlying kidney disease, systemic overexpression of TWEAK induced kidney inflammation and fibrosis. In cultured fibroblasts, TWEAK induced proliferation through activation of the Ras/ERK pathway. TWEAK also activated nuclear factor B (NFB)-dependent inflammatory chemokine production in murine renal fibroblasts.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We have previously demonstrated that prostaglandin F(2alpha) ( PGF (2alpha)) induces a rapid and transient expression of Nur77 in luteal cells. We have shown that Nur77 plays an important role in ovarian physiology by mediating the PGF (2alpha) induction of 20alpha-HSD, a steroidogenic enzyme involved in the catabolism of progesterone. In this report we established, using luteinized granulosa cells, that PGF (2alpha) stimulates in vitro nur77 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Serial 5'-deletion of the nur77 promoter revealed that the necessary and sufficient elements for PGF (2alpha) induction of Nur77 promoter activity are located between the nucleotides -86 and -33 upstream of the transcription start site, this region containing two AP1 elements. JunD binds to these AP1 sites, but its binding is not stimulated by PGF (2alpha). However, mutation of the AP1 sites as well as a dominant-negative JunD abolished nur77 induction by PGF (2alpha). PGF (2alpha) induces phosphorylation of JunD bound to the nur77 promoter. Stimulation of nur77 expression and JunD phosphorylation were prevented by inhibitors of calcium, calmodulin, or ERK1/2 kinase. PGF (2alpha)-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was prevented by calcium/calmodulin inhibitors.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Prion diseases recognize, as a unique molecular trait, the misfolding of CNS-enriched prion protein (PrP(C)) into an aberrant isoform (PrP(Sc)). In this work, we characterize the in vitro toxicity of amino-terminally truncated recombinant PrP fragment (amino acids 90-231, PrP90-231), on rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGN), focusing on glutamatergic receptor activation and Ca (2+) homeostasis impairment. This recombinant fragment assumes a toxic conformation (PrP90-231(TOX)) after controlled thermal denaturation (1 h at 53 °C) acquiring structural characteristics identified in PrP(Sc) (enrichment in -structures, increased hydrophobicity, partial resistance to proteinase K, and aggregation in amyloid fibrils). By annexin-V binding assay, and evaluation of the percentage of fragmented and condensed nuclei, we show that treatment with PrP90-231(TOX), used in pre-fibrillar aggregation state, induces CGN apoptosis. This effect was associated with a delayed, but sustained elevation of [ Ca (2+)]i. Both CGN apoptosis and [ Ca (2+)]i increase were not observed using PrP90-231 in PrP(C)-like conformation. PrP90-231(TOX) effects were significantly reduced in the presence of ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. In particular, CGN apoptosis and [ Ca (2+)]i increase were largely reduced, although not fully abolished, by pre-treatment with the NMDA antagonists APV and memantine, while the AMPA antagonist CNQX produced a lower, although still significant, effect.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Elevated skin surface pH has been reported in patients with atopic dermatitis. In this study, we explored the role of skin pH in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis using the NC/Tnd murine atopic dermatitis model. Alkalinization of the skin of asymptomatic NC/Tnd mice housed in specific pathogen-free conditions induced kallikrein 5 and activated protease-activated receptor 2, resulting in thymic stromal lymphopoietin secretion and a cutaneous T-helper 2 allergic response. This was associated with increased transepidermal water loss and development of eczematous lesions in these specific pathogen-free NC/Tnd mice, which normally do not suffer from atopic dermatitis. Injection of recombinant thymic stromal lymphopoietin also induced scratching behavior in the specific pathogen-free NC/Tnd mice. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin production and dermatitis induced by alkalinization of the skin could be blocked by the protease-activated receptor 2 antagonist ENMD-1068. In contrast, weak acidification of eczematous skin in conventionally housed NC/Tnd mice reduced kallikrein 5 activity and ameliorated the dermatitis. Onset of the dermatitis was associated with increased epidermal filaggrin expression and impaired activity of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger 1, a known regulator of skin pH.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), the most common cause of acute renal failure in childhood, is mainly caused by infection with Shiga toxin ( Stx )-producing enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). Besides its cytotoxic activity, Stx has been shown to interact with the complement system. Complement breakdown products have been found in serum of HUS patients suggesting complement activation and in vitro studies have demonstrated that Stx 2 directly activates complement leading to formation of terminal complement complex. Furthermore, Stx 2 has been found to bind to factor H (FH) resulting in a reduced cofactor activity on the cell surface. Binding of Stx 2 has also been shown for other members of the FH family, namely FH-like protein 1 and FH-related protein 1. Both proteins also compete with FH for Stx binding, so that in the presence of FHR-1 less FH is bound to Stx and therefore more is available for endothelial cell protection. In addition, Stx 2 has been demonstrated to downregulate the membrane-bound regulator CD59 on the surface of glomerular endothelial and tubulus epithelial cells on protein and at the mRNA level.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Vitiligo is an acquired skin depigmentation disorder resulting from the selective loss of epidermal melanocytes, and previous studies have suggested that a T lymphocyte-mediated mechanism has a role in melanocyte loss. Although Fas - Fas ligand ( Fas L) interactions are important for T lymphocytes to mediate cytotoxicity, there are only few reports examining the involvement of the Fas - Fas L pathway in vitiligo using in vivo mouse models. In addition, there have been no reports concerning Fas -mediated apoptosis in human melanocytes in vitro. In this study, we found that the Fas -mediated pathway is involved in cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-dependent vitiligo in a mouse model and Fas L-induced apoptosis of human melanocytes. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and interferon (IFN)-, the expression levels of which have been reported to be elevated in lesional skin of patients with vitiligo, synergistically upregulated Fas expression on human melanocytes but inhibited the Fas -mediated apoptosis. Treatment with TNF- and IFN- synergistically upregulated the expression of the anti-apoptotic genes, c-IAP2, c-FLIP and MCL1. A siRNA knock-down study showed that c-FLIP and MCL1, but not c-IAP2, were involved in inducing synergistic inhibitory effects on Fas -mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that Fas L and TNF-related apoptosis -inducing ligand (TRAIL) synergistically induced apoptosis on human melanocytes.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Changes in hepatic vasculature accompany fibrogenesis, and targeting angiogenic molecules often attenuates fibrosis in animals. Aquaporin-1 ( AQP1 ) is a water channel, overexpressed in cirrhosis, that promotes angiogenesis by enhancing endothelial invasion. The effect of AQP1 on fibrogenesis in vivo and the mechanisms driving AQP1 expression during cirrhosis remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to test the effect of AQP1 deletion in cirrhosis and explore mechanisms regulating AQP1. After bile duct ligation, wild-type mice overexpress AQP1 that colocalizes with vascular markers and sites of robust angiogenesis. AQP1 knockout mice demonstrated reduced angiogenesis compared with wild-type mice, as evidenced by immunostaining and endothelial invasion/proliferation in vitro. Fibrosis and portal hypertension were attenuated based on immunostaining, portal pressure, and spleen/body weight ratio. AQP1 protein, but not mRNA, was induced by hyperosmolality in vitro, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation. Endothelial cells from normal or cirrhotic mice were screened for microRNA (miR) expression using an array and a quantitative PCR. miR-666 and miR-708 targeted AQP1 mRNA and were decreased in cirrhosis and in cells exposed to hyperosmolality, suggesting that these miRs mediate osmolar changes via AQP1.

Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) are thought to be involved in many forms of programmed cell death. The role of ROS in cell death caused by oxidative glutamate toxicity was studied in an immortalized mouse hippocampal cell line (HT22). The causal relationship between ROS production and glutathione ( GSH ) levels, gene expression, caspase activity, and cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was examined. An initial 5-10-fold increase in ROS after glutamate addition is temporally correlated with GSH depletion. This early increase is followed by an explosive burst of ROS production to 200-400-fold above control values. The source of this burst is the mitochondrial electron transport chain, while only 5-10% of the maximum ROS production is caused by GSH depletion. Macromolecular synthesis inhibitors as well as Ac-YVAD-cmk, an interleukin 1beta-converting enzyme protease inhibitor, block the late burst of ROS production and protect HT22 cells from glutamate toxicity when added early in the death program. Inhibition of intracellular Ca2+ cycling and the influx of extracellular Ca2+ also blocks maximum ROS production and protects the cells.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Production of Bacillus subtilis exoproteases is positively regulated by the DegS-DegU two-component regulatory system and other regulatory factors including DegR and ProB. It was shown that the expression of degR was virtually abolished in a sigD mutant and that the transcription al initiation site in vivo is preceded by a sequence very similar to the consensus sequence of sigma D-recognized promoters. Alteration of the -10 sequence of the putative promoter greatly reduced the expression of degR. These results show that degR expression is driven by the alternative sigma factor, sigma D. It was found that degR expression was suppressed by multiple copies of proB on plasmid pLC1 and that this suppression was exerted at the transcription al level through a target in the vicinity of the degR promoter. Furthermore, it was shown that the expression of another sigma D-directed gene, hag, was suppressed by pLC1. Suppression by pLC1 diminished when the sequence of the -10 element of the degR promoter was changed to a sigma A-like promoter sequence. pLC1, however, did not suppress sigD expression.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The tumor suppressor p53 is an inducer of cell cycle arrest and programmed cell death ( apoptosis ). The ability of p53 to induce cell cycle arrest is linked to its ability to induce transcription of genes such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. However, the dependence of p53 -mediated apoptosis on transcriptional activation remains controversial. Ectopic expression of a temperature-sensitive (ts) p53 allele induced expression of p53 target genes and elicited both G1 and G2/M cell cycle arrest upon shift to the permissive temperature. Ectopic expression of the same ts p53 allele with two additional point mutations (Gln22, Ser23) that abolish p53 -transcriptional activation did not induce p53 target genes and G1 nor G2/M cell cycle arrest. In HCT116 colon carcinoma cells ectopic expression of wild type p53 does not elicit apoptosis whereas p53 mutant deficient in trans-activation induces apoptosis. The ability of wild type p53 to induce apoptosis is restored in HCT116 cells that are null for p21. However, the trans-activation deficient mutant of p53 is still more potent mediator of apoptosis than wild type p53 in the p21 null cells. Although the ability of Gln22,Ser23 to trans-activate p53 target genes is diminished, it retains the ability to repress Bcl-2 expression.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Claudin-1 ( CLDN-1 ) is one of main tight junction components that play an important role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ). However, the effects of CLDN-1 on the migration and EMT induced by TGF-1 in primary normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) and BEAS-2B cells have not been clear. The expression of CLDN-1 was quantified by Western blotting in NHBE and BEAS-2B cells. Cell migration and invasion were detected using transwell assays. The expression level of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, -SMA, and Vimentin was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting. Here we showed that the protein expression of CLDN-1 was increased exposed to TGF-1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Knockdown of CLDN-1 using small interfering CLDN-1 RNA (siCLDN-1) prevented the migration and invasion in NHBE and BEAS-2B cells. Moreover, depletion of CLDN-1 promoted the E-cadherin expression and decreased the mRNA and protein levels of N-cadherin, -SMA, and Vimentin induced by TGF-1.

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) plays a critical role in the initiation and progression of Alzheimers disease (AD), but little is known about the precise mechanism of OSAS-induced AD. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and nitric oxide (NO) are known to play key roles in the development of AD. Several studies have confirmed that an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, telmisartan, beneficially regulates NOS and NO. Here, we examined the neuroprotective effects of telmisartan against hippocampal apoptosis induced by chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), the most characteristic pathophysiological change of OSAS. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to 8h of intermittent hypoxia per day with or without telmisartan for eight weeks. Neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampal CA1 region, NOS activity, NO content, and the presence of inflammatory agents and radical oxygen species in the hippocampus were determined. The results showed that CIH activated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), increased NO content, and enhanced lipid peroxidation and inflammatory responses in the hippocampus. Treatment with telmisartan inhibited excessive iNOS and NO generation and reduced lipid peroxidation and inflammatory responses. In addition, telmisartan significantly ameliorated the hippocampal apoptosis induced by CIH.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Stress disrupts the preovulatory luteinizing hormone ( LH ) surge in females, but the mechanisms are unknown. We tested the hypothesis that cortisol compromises the ability of estrogen to induce a preovulatory-like LH surge in ovariectomized ewes in both the breeding and nonbreeding season. Luteinizing hormone surges were induced in ovariectomized ewes by treatment with progesterone followed by a surge-inducing estradiol-17beta ( E2 ) stimulus using a crossover design. The experiment was replicated in the breeding and nonbreeding seasons. Cortisol reduced the incidence of LH surges irrespective of season. Cortisol increased the latency from E2 stimulus to the onset of the surge in the breeding season only and suppressed the LH surge amplitude during both seasons (P0.01).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The present study was designed to investigate the effects of low-dose ketanserin on BP V (blood pressure variability), BRS (baroreflex sensitivity) and organ damage in SHR (spontaneously hypertensive rats). Ketanserin was mixed in rat chow at an estimated dose of 0.1 mg.kg(-1) of body weight.day(-1). SHR were treated for 4 months. BP (blood pressure) was then recorded continuously for 24 h in a conscious state. After determination of BRS, rats were killed for organ damage evaluation. It was found that long-term treatment with low-dose ketanserin did not lower BP levels, but significantly decreased BP V, enhanced BRS and reduced organ damage in SHR. Multiple regression analysis showed that the decrease in left ventricular hypertrophy was most closely correlated (or associated) with the increase in BRS, whereas the decrease in aortic hypertrophy was most closely associated with the decrease in diastolic BP V and the amelioration in renal lesion, with the increase in BRS and the decrease in diastolic BP V.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

When adult male Wistar-Kyoto rats had been injected intra-peritoneally with a dose of 100 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide ( CP ), their urinary bladders showed changes of thickening and haemorrhage visible macroscopically, and oedema, necrosis and haemorrhage of the mucosa visible microscopically. There was an increase in bladder weight from an average of 60 mg in untreated control rats to an average of 125 mg in the CP -treated rats. When in addition they had been given 400 mg/kg of a thiol drug, namely either penicillamine or its disulphide, or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or its S-carboxymethyl derivative carbocysteine, the increase in bladder weight and the histologic changes of haemorrhagic cystitis were found to be prevented by the co-administration of penicillamine or NAC but not by penicillamine disulphide or carbocysteine.

The effects of oestradiol -17beta, testosterone and progesterone alone and together with cycloheximide on the basal and gonadotrophin releasing hormone (Gn-RH)-induced release of gonadotrophins were studied in cultured dispersed rat pituitary cells. In the control group (no steroid treatment), GnRH significantly stimulated the release of LH and FSH; cycloheximide partially inhibited this response, although it had no effect on the basal secretion of gonadotrophins. A dose of 5 ng oestradiol /ml had no significant effect on the response to GnRH; at a dose of 100 ng/ml the GnRH-induced release of LH was significantly augmented whereas the release of FSH was inhibited. Cycloheximide blocked the augmenting effect of oestradiol. The basal release of LH was slightly but significantly inhibited in response to 10 ng testosterone/ml and increased in response to progesterone (200 ng/ml). Testosterone at both dose levels and progesterone significantly inhibited the GnRH-induced release of LH and FSH and in testosterone and progesterone-treated groups, the response to GnRH was inhibited by cycloheximide, but not beyond the levels observed in the control group.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Saiko is predominantly contained in Saireito, a Chinese herbal medicine. The present study was conducted to determine whether or not Saiko is involved in the inhibition by Saireito of nifedipine-induced proliferation and collagen synthesis in gingival fibroblasts. Nifedipine (10 microM) significantly enhanced the proliferation starting on day 5 of the culture period. When added together with nifedipine, Saiko at concentrations of 0.05%-0.2% (w/v) dose-dependently inhibited the nifedipine-induced proliferation, and at the highest concentration tested (0.2%), Saiko inhibited the nifedipine-induced proliferation by about 40%. Moreover, Saiko (0.2%) also inhibited the normal proliferation at days 11 and 14. Sole application of nifedipine (10 microM) augmented the release of bFGF, and Saiko concentration-dependently reduced the level of bFGF in the nifedipine-containing culture medium. Nifedipine (10 microM) increased the production of type I collagen to almost twice that of the control (normal medium), and Saiko at concentrations above 0.1% significantly reduced the nifedipineinduced production of collagen.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

A key regulatory point in fine tuning of steroidogenesis is the synthesis of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, which transfers cholesterol into mitochondria. Heat shock and toxic insults reduce steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, severely compromising steroid synthesis. As the molecular mechanisms for this reduction remain elusive, we tested the hypothesis that heat shock directly interferes with transcription of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein gene. We show that, in mouse MA-10 Leydig tumor cells, heat shock caused drastic declines in (Bu)(2)cAMP-induced progesterone accumulation and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein transcript abundance. A proximal steroidogenic acute regulatory protein promoter fragment (-85 to +39) is sufficient to direct both cAMP inducibility and heat shock inhibition. Nuclear extracts from MA-10 cells displayed binding to this proximal promoter fragment as a low mobility complex in gel shift experiments. This complex disappeared in nuclear extracts taken at 5 and 10 min after initiation of heat shock and reappeared in extracts taken at 2 and 8 h. Similar low- mobility complexes formed on oligonucleotides representing the overlapping subfragments of the minimal steroidogenic acute regulatory protein promoter fragment sensitive to the heat shock effect. Extracts from heat -shocked MA-10 cells displayed reduced complex formation to each of the subfragments.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of supplementing a Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product (SCFP) on body temperature indices, metabolism, acute phase protein response, and production variables during heat stress ( HS ). Twenty multiparous lactating Holstein cows (body weight = 675  12 kg; days in milk = 144  5; and parity = 2.3  0.1) were used in an experiment conducted in 2 replicates (10 cows/replicate). Cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dietary treatments: control diet (CON; n = 10) or the CON diet supplemented with 19 g/d of SCFP (n = 10; NutriTek, Diamond V, Cedar Rapids, IA). Cows were fed their respective diets for 21 d before initiation of the study. The experiment consisted of 2 periods: thermoneutral (period 1; P1) and heat stress (period 2; P2). During P1 (4 d), cows were fed ad libitum and housed in thermoneutral conditions for collecting baseline data. During P2 (7 d), HS was artificially induced using an electric heat blanket (EHB; Thermotex Therapy Systems Ltd., Calgary, AB, Canada). Cows were fitted with the EHB for the entirety of P2. Rectal temperature, respiration rate, and skin temperature were obtained twice daily (0600 and 1800 h) during both periods. Overall, HS increased rectal temperature, skin temperature, and respiration rate (1.4°C, 4.8°C, and 54 breaths/min, respectively) relative to P1, but no dietary treatment differences were detected. Compared with P1, HS decreased dry matter intake and milk yield (36 and 26%, respectively), and the reductions were similar between dietary treatments. Relative to P1, HS increased milk fat content and milk urea nitrogen (17 and 30%, respectively) and decreased milk protein and lactose contents (7 and 1.4%, respectively). Overall, HS increased (52%) plasma cortisol concentrations of CON, but circulating cortisol did not change in SCFP-fed cows.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The developmental pluripotencyassociated 4 (Dppa4) gene serves critical roles in cell selfrenewal, as well as in cancer development and progression. However, the regulatory role of Dppa4 in nonsmallcell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) and its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. The aim of the present study was to investigate the biological function of Dppa4 in NSCLC and its underlying mechanism of action. Dppa4 expression was measured in NSCLC tissue samples and cell lines, and its effect on cell proliferation and the expression of glycolytic enzymes was determined. In addition, the underlying mechanisms of Dppa4induced alterations in glycolysis were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were also performed to analyze the prognostic significance of clinicopathological characteristics. Dppa4 was found to be highly expressed in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, it was observed that Dppa4 was correlated with the degree of tumor differentiation and TNM stage. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified Dppa4 expression and clinical stage as prognostic factors for NSCLC patients. KaplanMeier analysis further revealed that patients with lower Dppa4 expression exhibited a better prognosis. In NSCLC cells, Dppa4 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, while Dppa4 overexpression enhanced cell proliferation, which was likely mediated by glycolysis promotion. Dppa4 knockdown had no evident effect on the majority of enzymes examined; however, glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and pyruvate kinase isozyme M2 were significantly upregulated, and hexokinase II (HKII) and lactate dehydrogenase B ( LDHB ) were downregulated following Dppa4 knockdown. By contrast, Dppa4 overexpression resulted in downregulation of GLUT4, and upregulation of HKII, enolase and LDHB, whereas it had no effect on other enzymes.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The aim of this study was to establish a simple and safe method of anaesthesia for intravital microcirculatory observations in small laboratory animals. The usefulness of isoflurane inhalation anaesthesia has been investigated in different strains of mice commonly used in experimental medicine. These were the hairless (hr/hr, n = 12), the BALB/c (n = 12) and the nude mouse (nu/nu, n = 3). Anaesthesia was maintained by mask inhalation of isoflurane vaporized at concentrations of up to 4% in the induction phase, at 1.5% during acute surgical procedures and at 0.8-1.3% during prolonged experimental observations. Isoflurane was vapoured in a N(2)O/O(2) mixture and saturated with 32-36% F(i)O(2). During observations the body temperature was kept constant at 37 degrees C. The tail artery was cannulated for monitoring of mean arterial blood pressure ( MAP ) and heart rate ( HR ). To maintain the body fluid balance, isotonic saline was administered at a constant rate of 0.2 ml/h. Arterial blood samples were drawn for blood-gas analysis at the end of the experiments. All animals survived the anaesthesia protocol lasting between 3 and 6.5 h. During isoflurane inhalation, no breathing complications or changes in systemic circulatory parameters were observed. Mean values of MAP and HR were 79+/- 3 mmHg and 486+/- 13 min(-1), respectively, over the entire observation period. A moderate acidosis was recorded in animals under isoflurane anaesthesia, with alterations of arterial blood pH, p(a)O(2) and pCO(2) values (7.29+/- 0.06, 130+/- 19 mmHg and 35.6+/- 4.7 mmHg, respectively).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) increases the risk of intracranial hemorrhage by gelatinase B (matrix metalloprotease-9; MMP-9 ) production in brain endothelial cells. It was recently reported that the free-radical scavenger edaravone significantly decreases t-PA-mediated MMP-9 production. Therefore, by using cultured brain endothelial cells (b.End3), we investigated whether t-PA-mediated MMP-9 production was enhanced by reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and its signaling pathways. Moreover, we also investigated that whether this combined enhancement is reduced by edaravone. The b.End3 cells were exposed to t-PA (10 g/mL), followed by H2O2 (30 M); further, the MMP-9 protein level was measured. ROS enhanced MMP-9 production, and ROS plus t-PA significantly increased MMP-9 production more than t-PA or ROS alone. The results showed that H2O2 or t-PA alone caused a significant increase in NF-B translocation to the nucleus, whereas the combination of t-PA and H2O2 increased the translocation of NF-B to an even greater extent. Moreover, the combination of t-PA and ROS significantly increased I-B degradation as well as NF-B expression.

Berberine, which is a wellknown drug used in traditional medicine, has been demonstrated to exert diverse pharmacological effects, including antiinflammatory effects. However, whether berberine can affect the production of inflammatory molecules in vascular endothelial cells remains to be elucidated. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the effects of berberine, and the underlying molecular mechanisms of these effects. The effect of berberine on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)induced inflammatory molecule expression was examined in cultured human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). The HAECs were stimulated with TNF and incubated with or without berberine. The activation of nuclear factor ( NF )B and adenosine monophosphateactivated protein kinase (AMPK) were analyzed using western blotting, and the protein secretion of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)1 was measured using ELISA kits. The mRNA expression levels of ICAM1 and MCP1 were analyzed using reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results of the present study demonstrated that berberine significantly inhibited the TNFinduced expression of ICAM1 and MCP1, as well as the activation of NF B in the HAECs.

Insulin-like growth factors (IGF)-I and -II are presumed to act as autocrine regulators of bone formation. Recently, we demonstrated that IGF-I and -II inhibit bone collagen degradation and collagenase-3 synthesis in osteoblast cultures. Therefore, we tested the autocrine role of IGFs in the endogenous expression of collagenase-3 in cultures of osteoblast-enriched cells from 22-day fetal rat calvariae (Ob cells). Steady-state messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were determined by Northern blot analysis and collagenase concentrations in the culture medium were determined by Western immunoblot. Basal level collagenase-3 transcripts decreased in Ob cell cultures, coinciding with an increase in IGF-I and -II protein levels. Removal of the conditioned medium modestly increased collagenase-3 mRNA levels and restored the ability of exogenously added IGF-I to repress collagenase-3 transcripts.

Perfusion of tracheal mucosa with neurokinin A (NKA) or substance P (SP) dose dependently increased PD in the presence of amiloride, with the potency being NKA > SP, but neurokinin B (NKB) had no effect. 3. Application of NG-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME, 10(-3) M) attenuated the NKA-induced increase in the amiloride -sensitive PD, causing a rightward displacement of the dose-response curve by approximately 1.0 log U, whereas NG-nitro-D-arginine methylester (D-NAME, 10(-3) M) did not. 4. The inhibitory effect of L-NAME was reversed by L-arginine (10(-2) M) but not by D-arginine (10(-2) M). 5. The release of NO was determined by a real-time measurement of NO concentration ([NO]) in the perfusate using specific amperometric sensors for this molecule. 6.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) has a negative impact on clinical outcomes for patients with myocardial infarction. The aim of the present study was to assess whether decreased myocardial levels of Sirtuin1 (Sirt1) contribute to the increased susceptibility of the diabetic myocardium to ischemia/reperfusion ( I/R ) injury. In vivo, myocardial levels of Sirt1 expression and activity were decreased in mice with STZ-induced DM. Increasing Sirt1 activity prevented the DM-induced exacerbation of myocardial mitochondrial fission, apoptosis and dysfunction elicited by I/R. In vitro, anoxia/reoxygenation (A/R) challenge of cardiomyocytes (CM) that were preconditioned with high glucose (HG-CM) resulted in an exacerbation of the A/R-induced mitochondrial fission, oxidant production and CM apoptosis ; effects reversed by increasing Sirt1 protein/activity. Inhibition of Drp1 prevented the exacerbated CM mitochondrial fission and oxidant production after A/R challenge of HG-CM. Decreased Sirt1 in HG-CM was associated with decreased Akt phosphorylation. Inhibition of Akt had no effect on CM Sirt1 levels, but further increased Drp1 activation.

Interferon ( IFN ) is being tested clinically in the treatment of a wide range of human malignancies. Patients undergoing cancer treatment may require radiotherapy in conjunction with IFN administration. This study examined the effect of purified preparations of IFN on the radiation response of mouse Swiss 3T3 cells in culture. Cells were exposed to 10 U/ml of mouse IFN or human IFN 2 hours prior to radiation. The IFN was left in the medium for the duration of the experiment. Marked enhancement of radiation response was observed in the presence of mouse IFN as compared to human IFN or no IFN treatment. The difference in radiation response was due to a reduction in the shoulder portion of the survival curve with no change in the slope of the exponential portion. Since human IFN was inactive in these experiments, the data suggest that the potentiation of radiation damage is specific for mouse IFN. The reduction in the shoulder in the presence of mouse IFN suggests the inhibition of the ability of cells to accumulate sublethal radiation injury.

The serotonin1A receptor partial agonist, buspirone, also displays antagonist properties at D2 receptors and is metabolized to the alpha2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, 1-(2-pyrimidinyl-piperazine). Herein, we examined mechanisms underlying the influence of buspirone alone, and in association with the serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, upon extracellular levels of serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline simultaneously quantified in the frontal cortex of freely moving rats. Buspirone (0.01-2.5 mg/kg, s.c.) dose-dependently decreased dialysate levels of serotonin (-50%), and increased those of dopamine (+100%) and noradrenaline (+140%). The reduction by buspirone of serotonin levels was abolished by the serotonin1A receptor antagonist, WAY 100,635 (0.16), which did not, however, modify its influence upon dopamine and noradrenaline. In contrast to buspirone, the serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine (10.0), increased frontocortical levels of serotonin (+ 120%), dopamine (+55%) and noradrenaline (+90%). Buspirone dose-dependently (0.01-2.5) decreased the induction by fluoxetine of serotonin levels yet potentiated (three-fold) its elevation of dopamine and noradrenaline levels. The serotonin1A agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propyl-amino)-tetralin (0.16), mimicked the action of buspirone in reducing resting levels of serotonin (-60%) and in enhancing those of dopamine (+135%) and noradrenaline (+165%).

Between subject correlations were calculated for measurements from 30 premenopausal women: % free oestradiol was inversely correlated with SHBG and free fatty acid s and positively correlated with Quetelet's Index; % SHBG-bound oestradiol was positively correlated with SHBG but was not consistently or significantly related to free fatty acid s or Quetelet's Index.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The aim of the present study was to determine the response of metallothionein ( MT ) during Cd accumulation and elimination in different tissues of the estuarine bivalve Ruditapes decussatus exposed to two nominal Cd concentrations (4 and 40 microg/L) for 40 d, followed by a depuration period of 50 d. Cadmium was accumulated in all tissues of R. decussatus at both exposure concentrations, and the accumulation was tissue dependent. Use of the kinetic model showed that in the gills and remaining tissues, Cd was assimilated faster at the beginning of the exposure and decreased with time, possibly limited by the diffusion rate of this metal within the cell. In the digestive gland, however, the Cd was continuously accumulated. This could reflect that the Cd uptake rate is considerably higher than the loss rate and, therefore, that this tissue has a higher capacity to accumulate Cd compared to the other two tissues. Moreover, the application of this kinetic model in the different subcellular fractions showed that the bioconcentration factor was significantly higher in the low-molecular-weight fraction (where MT is found), suggesting that this fraction binds Cd faster, with a high uptake rate (K(u) = 32/d), and eliminates this metal more slowly (K(1) = 0.005/d). During the depuration phase, MT decreased simultaneously with Cd elimination in all tissues, although with a shorter half-life.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Recent studies have shown that homozygous knockout of gene for calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CALCA ) receptor component, calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CALCRL), led to extreme hydrops fetalis and embryonic death, underlining the critical role of CALCA in embryonic development and fetal growth. The present study was designed to determine the cellular localization of CALCA and its receptor components, CALCRL and receptor activity modifying protein 1 (RAMP1), at the human implantation site during early pregnancy; to assess whether CALCA regulates in vitro angiogenesis of human endothelial cells; and to examine whether CALCA can improve angiogenic imbalance in preeclamptic placental explants. Our studies demonstrated that both protein and mRNA for CALCA were expressed by the villous and extravillous trophoblasts and decidual cells in the first-trimester villous tissues. CALCA receptor components, CALCRL and RAMP1, were expressed by both villous and extravillous trophoblast cells, as well as vascular endothelial cells. CALCA induced both endothelial proliferation and migration in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and it promoted capillarylike tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) on Matrigel. CALCA -induced angiogenesis of human endothelial cells was completely blocked by CALCA antagonist CALCA (8-37). Further, conditioned medium from preeclamptic placental explants significantly inhibited HUVEC capillarylike tube formation compared with gestational age-matched controls, and conditioned medium from preeclamptic placental explants incubated with CALCA significantly improved capillarylike tube formation.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

D- glucose at 5.6 mM reduces the progression of in vitro-produced (IVP) bovine embryos from the morula to the blastocyst stage and skews sex ratio towards males. Possibly, the presence of two transcriptionally active X-chromosomes compromises female embryo development through imbalance in glucose metabolism. Here, we have determined the threshold of embryo sensitivity to glucose, whether substitution of D-fructose for glucose reduces the selective loss of female embryos, and whether inhibition of an X-linked gene product, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), normalizes sex ratio among bovine blastocysts. IVP zygotes were cultured in glucose -free medium to 72 hr post-insemination, at which time 8-cell embryos were selected for treatment and cultured until 144 hr post-insemination. Addition of 4 mM glucose at the 8-cell stage reduced (P  0.05) the number of blastocyst that formed, whereas 2.5 and 1 mM glucose had no effect. Sex ratio in the presence of 4 and 2.5 mM glucose differed significantly from 0.5, while 1 mM glucose had no effect. D-fructose (5.6 mM) did not compromise development to blastocyst and did not alter the sex ratio of blastocysts that formed. When G6PD inhibitors (dehydroepiandrosterone: DHEA and 6-aminonicotinamide: 6-AN), which effectively inhibit the reduction of the NADPH-sensitive dye, brilliant cresyl blue (BCB) in bovine morulae, were added to the culture medium containing 4 mM glucose, embryo development was moderately reduced, but sex ratio skewing was corrected (with 6-AN) or lowered (with DHEA).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Changes in growth temperature induce both activating and inactivating responses from cells, with the magnitude of the temperature change being among the factors that influence which type of response dominates. Aside from upregulated enzyme activity, induction of thermotolerance is the most widely studied and best understood activating response that cells exhibit following heat shock. Inactivating responses to heat shock that are of biomedical interest include heat radiosensitization and cytotoxicity. Interestingly, the activation energy for inducing thermotolerance, heat cytotoxicity, and radiosensitization all fall within a similar range of 120-146 kcal per mole. The relatively high activation energy for each of these responses suggests that they all involve a heat -induced molecular transition as a trigger, and several lines of research suggest strongly that protein denaturation is the common transition that triggers all three responses. Low levels of protein denaturation are sufficient to attract the 90 kDa heat shock protein (HSP90) such that it frees up heat shock factor 1, which then trimerizes to form an active transcription factor that upregulates expression of heat shock proteins. Upregulation of heat shock proteins and other heat -induced events result in the development of thermotolerance, which protects cells from subsequent exposure to heat shock and other stresses. A more severe heat shock increases protein denaturation proportionately and leads to aggregation of both denatured and native proteins. This results in inactivation of protein synthesis, cell cycle progression, and DNA repair processes such that cells either die or are sensitized to radiation and other cytotoxic events. The ultimate fate of cells following a heat shock depends upon the summation of the activation and inactivation events that are induced, which appears to be governed by the resultant magnitude of protein denaturation and aggregation.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Gap junctions within extracellular matrix (ECM)-defined boundaries ensure synchronous activity between cells destined to become functional mediators that regulate cell behavior. However, the role of ECM in connexin (Cx) function in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) has not been elucidated. Therefore, we examined the role of laminin-111 in the control of Cx43 functions and related signal pathways in mESCs. ECM components (laminin-111, fibronectin, and collagen I) increased Cx43 phosphorylation and decreased Lucifer yellow (Ly) diffusion. In addition, laminin-111 increased the proliferation index through reduction of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC), which was confirmed by 18-glycyrrhetinic acid (18-GA). Laminin-111 increased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/Src and protein kinase C (PKC), which were inhibited by integrin 1 antibody (Ab) and laminin receptor-1 (LR-1) Ab, respectively. In addition, inhibition of both FAK/Src and PKC blocked Cx43 phosphorylation. Laminin-111 increased the Ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA) activation, which was blocked by FAK/Src and PKC inhibitors, suggesting the existence of parallel pathways that merge at RhoA. Inhibition of RhoA reversed the laminin-111-induced increase of Cx43 phosphorylation and reduction of GJIC. Laminin-111 also stimulated the dissociation of Cx43 /ZO-1 complex followed by disruption of Cx43 / drebrin and Cx43 /F-actin complexes, which were reversed by C3 (RhoA inhibitor). ZO-1 small interfering (si) RNA significantly decreased Ly diffusion.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Janus kinase-3 ( JAK3 ) fosters proliferation and counteracts apoptosis of lymphocytes and tumor cells. The gain of function mutation (A572V) JAK3 has been discovered in acute megakaryoplastic leukemia. JAK3 is inactivated by replacement of lysine by alanine in the catalytic subunit ((K855A) JAK3 ). Regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis involves altered activity of Cl(-) channels. The present study, thus, explored whether JAK3 modifies the function of the small conductance Cl(-) channel ClC-2. To this end, ClC-2 was expressed in Xenopus oocytes with or without wild-type JAK3, (A568V) JAK3 or (K851A) JAK3, and the Cl(-) channel activity determined by dual-electrode voltage clamp. Channel protein abundance in the cell membrane was determined utilizing chemiluminescence. As a result, expression of ClC-2 was followed by a marked increase of cell membrane conductance. The conductance was significantly decreased following coexpression of JAK3 or (A568V) JAK3, but not by coexpression of (K851A) JAK3. Exposure of the oocytes expressing ClC-2 together with (A568V) JAK3 to the JAK3 inhibitor WHI-P154 (4-[(3'-bromo-4'-hydroxyphenyl)amino]-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline, 22 M) increased the conductance.

We performed pulse-chase studies of posttranslational processing of hepcidin in human hepatoma HepG2 cells and in primary human hepatocytes induced with bone morphogenic protein (BMP-9). In some experiments, the cells were treated with the furin protease inhibitor decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone (CMK) or furin siRNA. In the absence of furin inhibitor, hepcidin was found to be processed in less than 1 h and secreted as a 3 kDa form reactive with anti-mature but not anti-pro antibody. In the presence of furin inhibitors or furin siRNA, a 6 kDa form reactive with both anti-pro and anti-mature antibody was rapidly secreted into the medium.

We studied the effect of two inhibitors of human neutrophil proteases on neutrophil chemotaxis induced by the hexapeptide Val-Gly-Val-Ala-Pro-Gly ( VGVAPG ), a recurring sequence in the elastin molecule. The inhibitors were tosyl-Phe chloromethyl ketone (TFCK) and N-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val chloromethyl ketone (MAAPVCK). We assayed chemotactic activity by the double-membrane technique in a modified Boyden chamber, after incubating the cells for 1 hr with varying concentrations of inhibitor. We observed a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect. We also measured the potency of the two chloromethyl ketones as protease inhibitors. The more potent protease inhibitor, MAAPVCK, was also the more effective in inhibiting VGVAPG -induced chemotaxis ; its inhibitor dissociation constant was KI = 28 nM with elastase and KI = 33 nM with cathepsin G. For TFCK the corresponding KI values were 37 microM and 200 microM. The incubating concentration required to lower chemotaxis by half its uninhibited value was C0.5 = 0.64 microM for MAAPVCK, compared to C0.5 = 3.4 microM for TFCK. A third peptide, triglycinate (gly3), which did not inhibit the proteolytic activity of either elastase or cathepsin G, did not inhibit chemotaxis. Chemotaxis induced by formyl Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) was weakly inhibited by both chloromethyl ketones with TFCK being somewhat more effective than MAAPVCK.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Cerebral edema is a potentially life-threatening illness, but knowledge of its underlying mechanisms is limited. Here we report that hypobaric hypoxia induces rat cerebral edema and neuronal apoptosis and increases the expression of corticotrophin releasing factor ( CRF ), CRF receptor type 1 ( CRF R1), aquaporin-4 (AQP4), and endothelin-1 (ET-1) in the cortex. These effects, except for the increased expression of CRF itself, could all be blocked by pretreatment with an antagonist of the CRF receptor CRF R1. We also show that, in cultured primary astrocytes: (i) both CRF R1 and AQP4 are expressed; (ii) exogenous CRF, acting through CRF R1, triggers signaling of cAMP /PKA, intracellular Ca(2+), and PKC; and (iii) the up-regulated cAMP /PKA signaling contributes to the phosphorylation and expression of AQP4 to enhance water influx into astrocytes and produces an up-regulation of ET-1 expression.

Tubulointerstitial inflammation is a common feature of renal diseases. We have investigated the relationship between inflammation and Na(+) transport in the collecting duct (CD) using the mCCD(cl1) and mpkCDD(cl4) principal cell models. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) decreased basal and aldosterone-stimulated amiloride-sensitive transepithelial current in a time-dependent manner. This effect was associated with a decrease in serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) mRNA and protein levels followed by a decrease in epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) alpha-subunit mRNA levels. The LPS-induced decrease in SGK1 expression was confirmed in isolated rat CD. This decreased expression of either SGK1 or the ENaC alpha-subunit was not due to enhanced degradation of mRNA. In contrast, LPS inhibited transcriptional activity of the SGK1 promoter measured by luciferase-reporter gene assay. The effect of LPS was not mediated by inhibition of mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid receptor, because expression of both receptors was unchanged and blockade of either receptor by spironolactone or RU486, respectively, did not prevent the down-regulation of SGK1. The effect of LPS was mediated by the canonical NF-kappaB pathway, as overexpression of a constitutively active mutant, IKKbeta (inhibitor of nuclear factor kappaB kinase-beta) decreased SGK1 mRNA levels, and knockdown of p65 NF-kappaB subunit by small interfering RNA increased SGK1 mRNA levels.

FcgammaR -mediated phagocytosis of IgG-coated particles is a complex process involving the activation of multiple signaling enzymes and is regulated by the inositol phosphatases PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) and SHIP-1 (Src homology [SH2] domain-containing inositol phosphatase). In a recent study we have demonstrated that SHIP-2, an inositol phosphatase with high-level homology to SHIP-1, is involved in FcgammaR signaling. However, it is not known whether SHIP-2 plays a role in modulating phagocytosis. In this study we have analyzed the role of SHIP-2 in FcgammaR -mediated phagocytosis using independent cell models that allow for manipulation of SHIP-2 function without influencing the highly homologous SHIP-1. We present evidence that SHIP-2 translocates to the site of phagocytosis and down-regulates FcgammaR -mediated phagocytosis. Our data indicate that SHIP-2 must contain both the N-terminal SH2 domain and the C-terminal proline-rich domain to mediate its inhibitory effect. The effect of SHIP-2 is independent of SHIP-1, as overexpression of dominant-negative SHIP-2 in SHIP-1-deficient primary macrophages resulted in enhanced phagocytic efficiency. Likewise, specific knockdown of SHIP-2 expression using siRNA resulted in enhanced phagocytosis.

The role of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) in diabetic nephropathy is typically viewed through the lens of inflammation, but MCP-1 might exert noninflammatory effects on the kidney cells directly. Glomerular podocytes in culture, verified to express the marker nephrin, were exposed to diabetic mediators such as high glucose or angiotensin II and assayed for MCP-1. Only transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) significantly increased MCP-1 production, which was prevented by SB431542 and LY294002, indicating that signaling proceeded through the TGF-beta type I receptor kinase and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. The TGF-beta -induced MCP-1 was found to activate the podocyte's cysteine-cysteine chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) and, as a result, enhance the cellular motility, cause rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, and increase podocyte permeability to albumin in a Transwell assay.

The postprandial reduction in blood pressure ( BP ) is triggered by the interaction of nutrients with the small intestine and associated with an increase in splanchnic blood flow. Gastric distension may attenuate the postprandial fall in BP. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of differences in intragastric volume, including distension at a low (100 ml) volume, on BP and superior mesenteric artery ( SMA ) blood flow responses to intraduodenal glucose in healthy older subjects. BP and heart rate (HR; automated device), SMA blood flow (Doppler ultrasound), mesenteric vascular resistance (MVR), and plasma norepinephrine of nine male subjects (65-75 yr old) were measured after an overnight fast on 4 separate days in random order. On each day, subjects were intubated with a nasoduodenal catheter, incorporating a duodenal infusion port, and orally with a second catheter, incorporating a barostat bag, positioned in the fundus. Each subject received a 60-min (t = 0-60 min) intraduodenal glucose infusion (3 kcal/min) and gastric distension at a volume of 1) 0 ml (V0), 2) 100 ml (V100), 3) 300 ml (V300), or 4) 500 ml (V500).

A case of intracerebral hemorrhage which probably had been caused by a rupture of abnormal "moyamoya vessels" due to tuberculous arteritis was reported. A 42-year-old female had a history of tuberculous meningitis at the age of 2 years and suffered from a sudden onset of severe headache in January of 1998. CT scan disclosed a medium-sized intracerebral hematoma in the left frontal base and many calcifications in the basal cistern. Subsequent angiography demonstrated high-grade stenosis in the terminal portion of the right internal carotid artery and near-by "moyamoya vessels". No surgery was performed on the patient. A second angiography was carried out two months later and it newly disclosed ophthalmic artery-feeding "moyamoya vessels" in the place where the intracerebral hematoma had been located.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Thrombin-induced platelet activation is initiated by PAR1 and PAR4 receptors. Vorapaxar, a PAR1 antagonist, has been assessed in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and stable atherosclerotic disease in addition to standard-of-care treatment. In clinical trials, vorapaxar has been observed to reduce the frequency of ischaemic events in some subgroups though in others has increased the frequency of bleeding events. Among patients undergoing CABG surgery, which is associated with excess thrombin generation, bleeding was not increased. The aim of these studies was to investigate the effects of selective PAR1 antagonism on thrombin -induced platelet activation in patients receiving vorapaxar or placebo in the TRACER trial and to explore the roles of PAR1 and PAR4 in thrombin -induced platelet activation in healthy volunteers. ACS patients receiving vorapaxar or placebo in the TRACER trial were studied at baseline and 4 hours, 1 and 4 months during drug administration. Thrombin-induced calcium mobilisation in platelet-rich plasma was assessed by flow cytometry. In vitro studies were performed in healthy volunteers using the PAR1 antagonist SCH79797 or PAR4 receptor desensitisation. Vorapaxar treatment significantly inhibited thrombin -induced calcium mobilisation, leaving a residual, delayed response. These findings were consistent with calcium mobilisation mediated via the PAR4 receptor and were reproduced in vitro using SCH79797. PAR4 receptor desensitization, in combination with SCH79797, completely inhibited thrombin -induced calcium mobilisation confirming that the residual calcium mobilisation was mediated via PAR4.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
In conclusion vorapaxar selectively antagonises the PAR1-mediated component of <el> thrombin <le>-induced <re> platelet activation <er>, leaving the PAR4-mediated response intact, which may explain why vorapaxar is well tolerated in patients undergoing CABG surgery since higher <el> thrombin <le> levels in this setting may override the effects of PAR1 antagonism through PAR4 activation, thus preserving haemostasis. positive----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

Antimony ( Sb ) is a potentially toxic chemical element abundantly found in the environment. We previously reported that Sb promoted neuronal deathvia reactive oxygen species-dependent autophagy. Here, we assessed the role of cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB) in Sb -induced neuronal damage. We found that Sb treatment induced CREB phosphorylation and neuronal apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, inhibition of CREB's transcriptional activity with 666-15 dramatically enhanced apoptosis in PC12 cells by downregulating B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2).

The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of phenylbutazone premedication on the pharmacokinetics and urinary excretion of frusemide in horses; and on frusemide -induced changes in urinary electrolyte excretion. Six Standardbred mares were used in a 3-way crossover design. The pharmacokinetics and renal effects of frusemide (1 mg/kg bwt i.v.) were studied with and without phenylbutazone premedication (8.8 mg/kg bwt per os 24 h before, followed by 4.4 mg/kg bwt i.v. 30 min before frusemide administration). A control (saline) treatment was also studied. Administration of frusemide without phenylbutazone led to diuresis, natriuresis, kaliuresis and chloruresis, and altered the ratio of sodium:chloride excretion from 0.4 to 1.0 in the first hour of diuresis. When frusemide and phenylbutazone were administered, sodium and chloride excretion in the first hour were significantly (P0.05) reduced by 40 and 32%, respectively, when compared to frusemide administrationwithout phenylbutazone. The fractional clearance of sodium and chloride was also significantly reduced. Potassium excretion, potassium fractional clearance and the ratio of sodium to chloride excretion were not affected by administration of phenylbutazone. During peak diuresis, phenylbutazone did not affect the efficiency of frusemide with respect to electrolyte excretion. The plasma disposition of frusemide was not affected by phenylbutazone. However, the renal excretion of frusemide decreased by approximately 25%.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Okadaic acid as well as other, structurally different, inhibitors of serine/threonine phosphatases 1 and 2A induce apoptosis in pituitary GH3 cells. Incubation with stepwise raised concentrations of okadaic acid resulted in the isolation of cells that were increasingly less sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of this agent. After about 18 months cells were selected that survived at 300 nM okadaic acid, which is about 30 times the initially lethal concentration. This study revealed that a major pharmacokinetic mechanism underlying cell survival was the development of a P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype. The increase in mRNA levels of the mdr1 b P-glycoprotein isoform correlated with the extent of drug resistance. Functional assays revealed that increasing drug resistance was paralleled by a decreased accumulation of rhodamine 123, a fluorescent dye which is a substrate of mdr1 -mediated efflux activity. Resistance could be abolished by structurally different chemosensitizers of P-glycoprotein function like verapamil and reserpine but not by the leukotriene receptor antagonist MK571 which is a modulator of the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP). Okadaic acid resistance included cross-resistance to other cytotoxic agents that are substrates of mdr1 -type P-glycoproteins, like doxorubicin and actinomycin D, but not to non-substrates of mdr1, e.g. cytosine arabinoside.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

HIV-1 Nef is a key factor in AIDS pathogenesis. Here, we report that Nef potently inhibits motility of fibroblasts and chemotaxis of HIV-1-infected primary human T lymphocytes toward the chemokines SDF-1alpha, CCL-19, and CCL-21 ex vivo. Furthermore, Nef inhibits guided motility of zebrafish primordial germ cells toward endogenous SDF-1a in vivo. These migration defects result from Nef-mediated inhibition of the actin remodeling normally triggered by migratory stimuli. Nef strongly induces phosphorylation of cofilin, inactivating this evolutionarily conserved actin-depolymerizing factor that promotes cell motility when unphosphorylated. Nef-dependent cofilin deregulation requires association of Nef with the cellular kinase Pak2. Disruption of Nef- Pak2 association restores the cofilin phosphorylation levels and actin remodeling that facilitate cell motility.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

5-Hydroxytryptophan ( 5-HT P) and p-methoxyamphetamine (p-MA) induce dose-dependent, lethal hyperthermia when applied intravenously to monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) pretreated rabbits. The time course of hyperthermia and the doses required to induce hyperthermia varies between the two substances. Results with alpha-MT and PCPA suggest that 5-HT P hyperthermia depends on 5-HT formation, release of endogenous 5-HT, and the presence of catecholamines, whereas p-MA-induced hyperthermia most likely is a result of indirect 5-HT release. Some neuroleptics (piflutixol, spiroperidol and methiotepine) are extremely potent inhibitors of the induced hyperthermia, Also the 5-HT receptor blocking agent methergoline antagonizes hyperthermia induced by the two substances in rather low doses.

Quercetin, one of the flavonoids present in plants, expresses several physiological functions including antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. However, its effect on intestinal epithelia remains to be elucidated. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been attracting considerable attention since ER stress triggers such disorders as inflammation and cancer. The effect of quercetin on ER stress was investigated in this present study. Several ER stress inducers (tunicamycin, A23187, thapsigargin and brefeldin A) were added to human colonic LS180 cells or Caco-2 cells with quercetin, and the GRP78 expression as an ER stress marker was determined. The results showed that quercetin suppressed the induction of GRP78 expression by these ER stress ors, excepting brefeldin A, at both the mRNA and protein levels. Additionally, XBP-1 mRNA splicing was determined to evaluate the activation of IRE1. The phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and shutdown of protein synthesis were determined to evaluate the activation of PERK. Although quercetin activated IRE1 and PERK when added to LS180 cells alone, it suppressed the activation of IRE1 and PERK induced by A23187 or thapsigargin. The suppressive effect of quercetin on GRP78 mRNA induction was reproduced by PI3K inhibitors (LY294002 and wortmannin), but not by vitamin C and E.

Animals were divided into two groups. After hemodynamics were stabilized, animals in group 1 (n = 5) received an infusion of L-NMA at 300 microg/kg per min, i.v., over 60 min, and group 2 (n = 5) received an infusion of aminoguanidine, infused at 1 mg/kg per min over 60 min. Hemodynamic parameters including arterial blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, dP/dt, and carotid, coronary, hepatic, portal, mesenteric, and renal blood flows were continuously recorded before and 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 min after L-NMA infusion or aminoguanidine infusion, or both. The L-NMA vasopressor response (20%) was associated with a significant increase in systemic vascular resistance (45%). Carotid, hepatic, and renal vascular resistance increased significantly by 95%, 110%, and 20%, respectively, at 60 min after L-NMA infusion. Finally, heart rate, cardiac output, dP/dt, and portal and mesenteric blood flows remained unchanged after L-NMA infusion.

L-Arginine (L-Arg) affects various parameters that modulate the progression of renal disease. These same factors [e.g., glomerular filtration rate, changes in mesangial cell ( MC ) tension, and production of NO] are all controlled at least in part by changes in MC intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). We therefore evaluated the effect of L-Arg on MC [Ca2+]i. We found that L-Arg inhibits the vasopressin -stimulated rise in MC [Ca2+]i both in rat and murine cell cultures. This effect does not appear to be due to metabolism of L-Arg to either NO or L-ornithine (L-Orn). Blocking the metabolism of L-Arg with Nomega-monomethyl-L-arginine, an NO synthase inhibitor, or with 20 mM L-valine (L-Val), an inhibitor of Orn formation, does not reverse the inhibition. However, other cationic amino acids, as well guanidine, the functional group of L-Arg, all inhibit the vasopressin -stimulated rise in [Ca2+]i, consistent with a structural basis for this effect.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Both insulin resistance and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) have been reported to play essential pathophysiological roles in cardiovascular diseases. However, the mechanistic link between ROS and insulin resistance in the vasculature remains unclear. Recently we have shown that insulin causes KATP channel activation mediated by PI3K in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). KATP channel in VSMCs is critical in the regulation of vascular tonus. Here we examined the effects of ROS induced by a thol-oxidizing agent, diamide, on the insulin signalling pathway and KATP channel activities in cultured VSMCs (A10 cells). Diamide (100 microM) increased intercellular ROS and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) activity. Treatment with 100 M diamide suppressed significantly insulin -induced IRS and Akt phosphorylation. In addition to IRS and Akt, diamide inhibited insulin receptor auto-phosphorylation.

1. In seven unanaesthetized fetal sheep (> 80% term), isocapnic hypoxia (arterial partial pressure of O2, Pa,O2, approximately 15 mmHg) was induced for 1 h by lowering maternal inspired PO2. Fetal hypoxia was also produced during intra-arterial administration of the adenosine receptor antagonist 8-(p-sulphophenyl)-theophylline (8-SPT). The fetal 8-SPT infusion was begun just prior to hypoxia and was stopped when fetal Pa,O2 was returned to normal. 2. Hypoxia induced a progressive fetal acidosis, a rise in mean arterial pressure, a transient fall in heart rate and a decrease in breathing movements. 8-SPT significantly reduced the metabolic acidosis and abolished the hypertension and bradycardia without altering hypoxic inhibition of fetal breathing.

Rats with long-term cholestasis have reduced ketosis during starvation. Because it is unclear whether this is also the case in short-term cholestasis, we investigated hepatic fatty acid metabolism in rats with bile duct ligation for 5 days (BDL5, n = 11) or 10 days (BDL10, n = 11) and compared the findings with those made with pair-fed control rats (CON5 and CON10, n = 11). The plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration was reduced in BDL rats (0.54 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.83 +/- 0.30 mM at 5 days and 0.59 +/- 0.24 vs. 0.88 +/- 0.09 mM at 10 days in BDL and control rats, respectively). In isolated liver mitochondria, state 3 oxidation rates for various substrates were not different between BDL and control rats. Production of ketone bodies from [(14)C]palmitate was reduced by 40% in mitochondria from BDL rats at both time points, whereas production of (14)CO(2) was maintained. These findings indicated intact function of the respiratory chain, Krebs cycle, and beta-oxidation and suggested impaired ketogenesis (HMG-CoA pathway). Accordingly, the formation of acetoacetate from acetyl-CoA by disrupted mitochondria was reduced in BDL rats at 5 days (2.1 +/- 1.0 vs. 4.8 +/- 1.9 nmol/min per mg protein) and at 10 days (1.7 +/- 1.0 vs. 6.2 +/- 1.9 nmol/min per mg protein).

In the recent years, the participation of the animal lectin galectin (gal)-3 in inflammation and in host defence mechanisms was extensively studied. In vivo studies implied - among others - a role of gal-3 in the recruitment of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) to sites of bacterial infection. In that context, we asked the question whether gal-3 was chemotactic for PMN. Functional assays revealed that gal-3 was not chemotactic for PMN, but that it inhibited the spontaneous migration and the chemotaxis of PMN towards complement C5a, interleukin (IL)-8, or ATP. Moreover, gal-3 inhibited the shape change and the actin polymerisation of PMN that occurs in response to C5a or IL-8. By use of FITC-labelled gal-3, we found that it attached rapidly to the PMN membrane in a lactose-sensitive manner. In response to gal-3 the MAP kinase p38 was phosphorylated. This kinase is crucial for the migration of PMN towards end-target chemokines, such as C5a, and is activated in response to C5a or IL-8.

In plasma membranes derived from bovine mesenteric lymphatic smooth muscle cells, guanine nucleotide and forskolin stimulated adenylyl cyclase ( AC ) activity in a concentration-dependent manner, indicative of the presence of the stimulatory G-protein Gs linked to AC. There was no significant enzyme inhibition by low concentrations of guanine nucleotide and no effect on basal or guanine nucleotide-stimulated activity following pertussis toxin treatment of cells, suggesting the absence of Gi linked to inhibition of AC. Furthermore, there was no effect of adrenaline, isoprenaline or clonidine on basal or forskolin-stimulated activities, nor was there any specific binding of the beta-adrenoceptor ligand [125I]cyanopindolol to membranes, suggesting that catecholamine receptors do not modulate AC activity in these membranes. Pertussis toxin-mediated ADP ribosylation of membrane proteins and Western immunoblotting analysis revealed the presence of G-protein subunits G alpha i2, G alpha q, and G beta 1. In experiments designed to identify a possible effector enzyme for these G-proteins, membranes were screened with a range of antibodies raised against phospholipase C (PLC) beta, gamma and delta isozymes. Though no evidence was obtained by Western blotting for any of these proteins, PLC activity was concentration-dependently stimulated by Ca2+, but not by AIF4-, GTP[S], or purified G beta gamma subunits.

TRH, epidermal growth factor ( EGF ), and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) stimulate PRL synthesis by GH4C1 rat pituitary cells. Recent evidence suggests that TPA activates directly phospholipid- and calcium-dependent protein kinase C in other cell types and that TRH might act analogously by altering phospholipid metabolism in GH4C1 cells. To examine the pathways by which these three agents stimulate PRL synthesis, we determined their calcium dependencies as well as their combined effects on PRL production. By equilibration of GH4C1 cells in a protein-free medium for 24 h, the free cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was found to increase (from 90 to 360 nM) when the extracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]e) was varied from 15 to 800 microM. Basal PRL production increased in parallel (from 1 to 4 micrograms/ml X 24 h). TPA-stimulated PRL production was highly calcium dependent and required 180 nM [Ca2+]i for maximal enhancement. TRH-stimulated PRL production was constant between 10 and 660 microM [Ca2+]e, whereas EGF stimulated PRL production to a similar extent as TRH at 10 microM [Ca2+]e, but continued to enhance production with increasing [Ca2+]e. TRH elevated [Ca2+]i acutely, and at [Ca2+]e greater than 100 microM caused both a burst and a plateau phase in elevated [Ca2+]i. At lower [Ca2+]e, at which TRH still caused a maximal stimulation of PRL production, only the burst phase of [Ca2+]i occurred. When cultures were treated with any combination of maximally effective concentrations of TPA, TRH, or EGF, PRL production was increased by additive increments.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
We conclude that TPA stimulates <re> PRL <er> production by a highly calcium-dependent pathway and that TRH and <el> EGF <le> stimulate <re> PRL <er> production by a different pathway(s) requiring lower [Ca2+]i. positive----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 ( FGFR3 ) activating mutations are drivers of malignancy in several human tissues, including bladder, lung, cervix, and blood. However, in skin, these mutations are associated predominantly with benign, common epidermal growths called seborrheic keratoses (SKs). How epidermis resists FGFR3 mediated transformation is unclear, but previous studies have suggested that FGFR3 activation in skin keratinocytes may serve a tumor-suppressive role by driving differentiation and antagonizing Ras signaling. To define the role of FGFR3 in human normal and neoplastic epidermis, and to directly test the hypothesis that FGFR3 antagonizes Ras, we engineered human skin grafts in vivo with mutant active FGFR3 or shRNA FGFR3 knockdown. We show that FGFR3 active mutants drive mild hyperproliferation, but are insufficient to support benign or malignant tumorigenesis, either alone, or in combination with G 1-S checkpoint release. This suggests that additional cell-intrinsic or stromal cues are required for formation of benign SKs with FGFR3 mutations. Further, FGFR3 activation does not alter the growth kinetics or differentiation status of engineered human epidermal SCC s driven by Ras, and FGFR3 protein itself is dispensable for Ras-driven SCC. To extend these findings to patients, we examined a uniquely informative human tumor in which SCC developed in continuity with a SK, raising the hypothesis that one of the tumors evolved from the other.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We evaluated the modulatory role of the groundwater contaminant arsenic on the pharmacodynamic responses of the nonsteroidal analgesic-antipyretic drug ketoprofen and the major pro-inflammatory mediators linked to the mechanism of ketoprofen's therapeutic effects. Rats were pre-exposed to sodium arsenite (0.4, 4 and 40 ppm) through drinking water for 28 days. The pharmacological effects of orally administered ketoprofen (5 mg/kg) were evaluated the following day. Pain, inflammation and pyretic responses were, respectively, assessed through formalin-induced nociception, carrageenan-induced inflammation and lipopolysaccharide-induced pyrexia. Arsenic inhibited ketoprofen's analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic effects. Further, arsenic enhanced cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 activities and tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-1 and prostaglandin-E(2) production in hind paw muscle. These results suggest a functional antagonism of ketoprofen by arsenic. This may relate to arsenic -mediated local release of tumor necrosis factor- and interleukin-1, which causes cyclooxygenase induction and consequent prostaglandin-E(2) release.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The osteoinductive factors BMP-2 and Tmem119 that promote the differentiation of myoblasts into osteoblasts, each increase the levels of the other. However, the relative contributions of BMP-2 and Tmem119 to the osteogenic differentiation and the mechanisms involved are incompletely understood. In the present study, we examined the relationship among BMP-2, Tmem119, and the PERK-eIF2-ATF4 endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response pathway in the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into osteoblastic cells. Both BMP-2 and Tmem119 induced levels of the osteoblast markers Runx2, Osterix, Col1a1, ALP, and osteocalcin, as well as mineralization. BMP-2 activation of the ER stress sensor PERK stimulated phosphorylation of eIF2 and led to increased biosynthesis of the osteoblast differentiation factor ATF4. When dephosphorylation of eIF2 was blocked by the selective inhibitor salubrinal, the osteogenic effects of BMP-2 and Tmem119 were enhanced further. Although BMP-2 stimulated both P-eIF2 and ATF4 levels, Tmem119 had no effect on P-eIF2 but stimulated ATF4 only. Reduction in endogenous Tmem119 levels by siRNA reduced both basal and BMP-2 -stimulated levels of the ATF4 protein.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) therapy involves the compounds cytotoxic to both malignant tumor and normal cells. Relapsed APL is resistant to subsequent chemotherapy. Novel agents are in need to kill APL cells selectively with minimal toxicity. DDX5 has been recognized to be a novel target to suppress acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the role of DDX5 remains elusive in APL. Here a DDX5-targeting fully human monoclonal autoantibody named after 2F5 was prepared. It is demonstrated that 2F5 selectively inhibited APL cell proliferation without toxicity to normal neutrophil and tissues. Moreover, 2F5 was confirmed to induce G0/G1 phase arrest in APL cells, and promote APL cell differentiation combined with decreased DDX5 expression and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Knockdown of DDX5 by siRNA also inhibited proliferation, promoted cell differentiation and enhanced ROS production in APL cells. However, the ROS inhibitor reversed the effects of 2F5 on DDX5 and ROS in APL cells.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Exposure to estrogens during critical stages of development has been reported to cause irreversible changes in estrogen target tissues such as the reproductive tract. In fact, recent studies using mice describe prenatal estrogen exposure resulting in the expression of the major estrogen-inducible uterine secretory protein, lactoferrin ( LF ), by the seminal vesicles of the male offspring. Thus, we have studied the role of estrogens in abnormal and normal gene expression in the developing male reproductive tract using LF and seminal vesicle secretory protein IV (SVS IV), an androgen-regulated murine seminal vesicle secretory protein, as markers. Lactoferrin and SVS IV protein and mRNA expression were studied in histological samples by using the techniques of in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Seminal vesicle secretory protein IV was expressed in all (100%) epithelial cells of the control seminal vesicle, but this protein was decreased by castration. However, LF expression was undetectable by ISH or IHC in control seminal vesicle epithelium. Lactoferrin was inducible in 2% of the seminal vesicle epithelial cells from adult castrated mice treated with estradiol 17 beta (E2; 20 micrograms/kg/day for 3 days), indicating that a small percentage of the seminal vesicle cells could be induced to secrete LF after modification of the endocrine environment. Prenatal DES treatment (100 micrograms./kg. maternal body weight on days 9 through 16 of gestation) resulted in the male offspring exhibiting constitutive expression of LF in 5% of the seminal vesicle epithelial cells, while expression of the androgen-regulated protein SVS IV was slightly decreased.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
Since a large percentage of the epithelial cells in the intact prenatal <el> DES <le> exposed male was capable of expressing the normal gene product, SVS IV, it was concluded that <el> DES <le> treatment during prenatal development appears to imprint or induce estrogenic sensitivity in the adult seminal vesicle, causing increased production of <re> LF <er>. positive----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

The exposure of cells to ultraviolet B radiation (UV-B) can induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which damage cellular components. Free radical scavengers and antioxidants can interfere with the production of ROS. We measured 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels, a marker of oxidative DNA damage in rabbit corneal-derived cells (SIRC) exposed to UV-B in the presence of 4-coumaric acid, a natural polyphenol. The levels of 8-OHdG were increased significantly (P0.01) following irradiation (from 12+/-1.2x10(-6) to 29+/-6.2x10(-6) dG, means+/-SE). When 10 microM 4-coumaric acid was added to the medium, 8-OHdG levels were similar to those of unexposed cells (16.8+/-0.8x10(-6) dG). UV-B irradiation decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in SIRC cells from 0.29+/-0.6 to 0.15+/-0.04 mU/mg (means+/-SE). The presence of 10 microM 4-coumaric acid prevented the decrease in SOD activity (0.20+/-0.05 mU/mg, P0.05). On the contrary, SIRC cells exposed to UV-B had higher levels of xanthine oxidase ( XO ) activity compared with control ones (0.40+/-0.07 and 0.24+/-0.08 mU/mg, means+/-SE, respectively). In the presence of 10 microM 4-coumaric acid, the increase in XO activity was prevented (0.16+/-0.03 mU/mg; mean+/-SE).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Hypoxia triggers responses in endothelial cells that play roles in many conditions including high-altitude pulmonary edema and tumor angiogenesis. Signaling pathways activated by hypoxia modify cytoskeletal and contractile proteins and alter the biomechanical properties of endothelial cells. Intermediate filaments are major components of the cytoskeleton whose contribution to endothelial physiology is not well understood. We have previously shown that hypoxia -activated signaling in endothelial cells alters their contractility and adhesiveness. We have also linked p38-MAP kinase signaling pathway leading to HSP27 phosphorylation and increased actin stress fiber formation to endothelial barrier augmentation. We now show that vimentin, a major intermediate filament protein in endothelial cells, is regulated by hypoxia. Our results indicate that exposure of endothelial cells to hypoxia causes vimentin filament networks to initially redistribute perinuclearly. However, by 1 hour hypoxia these networks reform and appear more continuous across cells than under normoxia. Hypoxia also causes transient changes in vimentin phosphorylation, and activation of PAK1, a kinase that regulates vimentin filament assembly. In addition, exposure to 1 hour hypoxia increases the ratio of insoluble/soluble vimentin. Overexpression of phosphomimicking mutant HSP27 (pmHSP27) causes changes in vimentin distribution that are similar to those observed in hypoxic cells. Knocking-down HSP27 destroys the vimentin filamentous network, and disrupting vimentin filaments with acrylamide increases endothelial permeability. Both hypoxia - and pmHSP27 overexpression-induced changes are reversed by inhibition of phosphatase activity.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

1. Adenosine has been shown to decrease Ca2+ current (ICa) and attenuate the hypoxia -induced enhancement of intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in oxygen-sensitive rat phaeochromocytoma (PC12) cells. These effects are mediated via the adenosine A2A receptor and protein kinase A ( PKA ). The current study was undertaken to determine the effects of adenosine on Ca2+ current and hypoxia -induced change in [Ca2+]i during chronic hypoxia. 2. Whole cell patch-clamp studies revealed that the effect of adenosine on ICa was significantly reduced when PC12 cells were exposed to hypoxia (10 % O2) for 24 and 48 h. 3. Ca2+ imaging studies using fura-2 revealed that the anoxia-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was significantly enhanced when PC12 cells were exposed to 10 % O2 for up to 48 h. In contrast, the inhibitory effects of adenosine on anoxia-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i was significantly blunted in PC12 cells exposed to hypoxia for 48 h. 4. Northern blot analysis revealed that mRNA for the A2A receptor, which is the only adenosine receptor subtype expressed in PC12 cells, was significantly upregulated by hypoxia. Radioligand binding analysis with [3H]CGS21680, a selective A2A receptor ligand, showed that the number of adenosine A2A receptor binding sites was similarly increased during exposure to 10% O2 for 48 h. 5. PKA enzyme activity was significantly inhibited when PC12 cells were exposed to 10% O2 for 24 and 48 h. However, we found that hypoxia failed to induce change in adenosine- and forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase enzyme activity. Chronic hypoxia also did not alter the immunoreactivity level of the G protein Gsalpha, an effector of the A2 signalling pathway.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The objective of the current study was to investigate the effects of Rap1GAP on invasion and progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) and the role of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 and MMP2 in this process. Rap1GAP functions by switching off Rap1, the Ras-like protein that has been associated with carcinogenesis. Previous findings suggest that Rap1GAP acts as a tumor suppressor protein in SCC by delaying the G(1)-S transition of the cell cycle. However, cells transfected with Rap1GAP exhibit a more invasive phenotype than corresponding vector-transfected control cells. MMP2 and MMP9 are enzymes that mediate SCC invasion via degradation of the extracellular matrix. Using SCC cells transfected with empty vector or Rap1GAP, cell invasion and MMP secretion were determined by Matrigel assays and gelatin zymography, respectively. Rap1GAP up-regulated transcription and secretion of MMP2 and MMP9, as assayed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and zymography. Furthermore, chemical and RNA interference blockade of MMP2/ MMP9 inhibited invasion by Rap1GAP-transfected cells. Immunohistochemical staining of a human oropharyngeal SCC tissue microarray showed that Rap1GAP and MMP9 expression and staining intensity are correlated (P  0.0001) and that, in early N-stage lesions of SCC, high MMP9 is prognostic of poor disease-specific survival (P  0.05). Furthermore, Rap1GAP staining is correlated with MMP2 (P  0.03). MMP2 in combination with N stage has a prognostic effect on time to indication of surgery at primary site.

It has been shown that capsaicin-sensitive sensory-motor nerves contribute to the control of peripheral vascular resistance by releasing the potent vasodilator calcitonin gene-related peptide. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the P1-purinoceptor subtype that modulates capsaicin-sensitive non-adrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) neurotransmission in the rat mesenteric arterial bed. Analogs of adenosine, selective for the adenosine receptor subtypes A1 or A2, were evaluated on the vasodilator response to electrical stimulation of capsaicin-sensitive sensory-motor nerves. The order of potency of adenosine receptor agonists to inhibit the NANC neurotransmission was: the selective adenosine A1 receptor agonist N6cyclopentyl- adenosine > or = R-phenylisopropyladenosine > 5'N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine > or = 2-chloroadenosine > or = S-phenylisopropyladenosine. The A2-selective agonist CGS 21680 was devoid of any effect on NANC neurotransmission. In addition, the selective A1 receptor antagonist, 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine inhibited the effect of adenosine. None of the agonists tested showed direct action on the tone of the mesenteric vasculature.

FAT10 belongs to the ubiquitin-like modifier (ULM) family that targets proteins for degradation and is recognized by 26S proteasome. FAT10 is presented on immune cells and under the inflammatory conditions, is synergistically induced by IFN  and TNF in the non-immune (liver parenchymal) cells. It is not clear how viral proteins and alcohol regulate FAT10 expression on liver cells. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether FAT10 expression on liver cells is activated by the innate immunity factor, IFN  and how HCV protein expression in hepatocytes and ethanol-induced oxidative stress affect the level of FAT10 in liver cells. For this study, we used HCV(+) transgenic mice that express structural HCV proteins and their HCV(-) littermates. Mice were fed Lieber De Carli diet (control and ethanol) as specified in the NIH protocol for chronic-acute ethanol feeding. Alcohol exposure enhanced steatosis, induced oxidative stress and decreased proteasome activity in the liversof these mice, with more robust response to ethanol in HCV(+) mice. IFN  induced transcriptional activation of FAT10 in liver cells, which was dysregulated by ethanol feeding. Accordingly, IFN -activated expression of FAT10 in hepatocytes (measured by indirect immunofluorescent of liver tissue) was also suppressed by ethanol exposure in both HCV(+) and HCV(-) mice. This suppression was accompanied with ethanol-mediated induction of lipid peroxidation marker, 4-HNE. All aforementioned effects of ethanol were attenuated by in vivo feeding of mice with the pro-methylating agent, betaine, which exhibits strong anti-oxidant properties. Based on this study, we hypothesize that FAT10 targets oxidatively modified proteins for proteasomal degradation, and that the reduction in FAT10 levels along with decreased proteasome activity may contribute to stabilization of these altered proteins in hepatocytes.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Progression of pulmonary hypertension is associated with increased proliferation and migration of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells. PDGF is a potent mitogen and involved in this process. We now report that the PDGF receptor antagonist STI571 (imatinib) reversed advanced pulmonary vascular disease in 2 animal models of pulmonary hypertension. In rats with monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension, therapy with daily administration of STI571 was started 28 days after induction of the disease.

Stimulation of the local renin-angiotensin system and apoptosis characterize the diabetic heart. Because IGF-1 reduces angiotensin (Ang) II and apoptosis, we tested whether streptozotocin-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy was attenuated in IGF-1 transgenic mice (TGM). Diabetes progressively depressed ventricular performance in wild-type mice (WTM) but had no hemodynamic effect on TGM. Myocyte apoptosis measured at 7 and 30 days after the onset of diabetes was twofold higher in WTM than in TGM. Myocyte necrosis was apparent only at 30 days and was more severe in WTM. Diabetic nontransgenic mice lost 24% of their ventricular myocytes and showed a 28% myocyte hypertrophy; both phenomena were prevented by IGF-1. In diabetic WTM, p53 was increased in myocytes, and this activation of p53 was characterized by upregulation of Bax, angiotensinogen, Ang type 1 ( AT (1)) receptors, and Ang II.

Sema phorin ( Sema ) 3A and Sema 4A are immunomodulatory molecules with a common receptor, neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), on the immune cells. Sema 3A binds to NRP-1 and inhibits T cell activation and inflammation, while Sema 4A binds to NRP-1 and promotes T cell activation and inflammation. These molecules are associated closely with the regulation of protein kinase B (AKT)/nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-B) signaling, which are poorly understood in arsenic toxicity. The present study explored the role of Sema 3A or Sema 4A in arsenic-induced hepatotoxicity in mice. Arsenic exposure induced hepatic injury and resulted in the activations of p-AKT2, NF-B p65, and NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 ( NLRP3 ) inflammasome, downregulation of Sema 3A, and upregulation of Sema 4A or NRP-1.

Metformin is well known to stimulate the AMP kinase that subsequently reduces hepatic nuclear factor 4-alpha (HNF4-alpha) and HNF4-alpha regulated genes like ApoB. However, HNF4-alpha was only diminished by 1 mM metformin and ApoB mRNA was not suppressed indicating that this pathway may not explain reduced ApoB release. Lower abundance of lysophosphatidylcholine ( lysoPC ) may also diminish ApoB secretion. Therefore, electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry was applied to measure cellular lipids. PC, lysoPC (produced by hydrolysis of PC), phosphatidylserine and sphingomyelin (derived from PC) were lower in metformin -treated hepatocytes whereas phosphatidylethanolamine, an alternative precursor of PC, was not affected. In addition, ABCB4, the canalicular membrane flippase essential for biliary PC secretion, was diminished. Supplementation with lysoPC led to a selective elevation of endogenous lysoPC and rescued ApoB secretion in metformin -treated cells.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
Therefore, it is concluded that <el> metformin <le> reduces <re> lysoPC <er> in human hepatocytes and this may secondarily lead to a therapeutically beneficial lower release of ApoB. negative----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

The requirement of DAG (diacylglycerol) to recruit PKD (protein kinase D) to the TGN (trans-Golgi network) for the targeting of transport carriers to the cell surface, has led us to a search for new components involved in this regulatory pathway. Previous findings reveal that the heterotrimeric Gbetagamma (GTP-binding protein betagamma subunits) act as PKD activators, leading to fission of transport vesicles at the TGN. We have recently shown that PKCeta (protein kinase Ceta) functions as an intermediate member in the vesicle generating pathway. DAG is capable of activating this kinase at the TGN, and at the same time is able to recruit PKD to this organelle in order to interact with PKCeta, allowing phosphorylation of PKD's activation loop. The most qualified candidates for the production of DAG at the TGN are PI-PLCs (phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipases C), since some members of this family can be directly activated by Gbetagamma, utilizing PtdIns(4,5)P2 as a substrate, to produce the second messengers DAG and InsP3. In the present study we show that betagamma-dependent Golgi fragmentation, PKD 1 activation and TGN to plasma membrane transport were affected by a specific PI-PLC inhibitor, U73122 [1-(6-[17-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl]aminohexyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione].----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Arf (ADP-ribosylation factor) GAPs (GTPase-activating proteins) are enzymes that catalyse the hydrolysis of GTP bound to the small GTP-binding protein Arf. They have also been proposed to function as Arf effectors and oncogenes. We have set out to characterize the kinetics of the GAP-induced GTP hydrolysis using a truncated form of ASAP1 [ Arf GAP with SH3 (Src homology 3) domain, ankyrin repeats and PH (pleckstrin homology) domains 1] as a model. We found that ASAP1 used Arf 1-GTP as a substrate with a k(cat) of 57+/-5 s(-1) and a K(m) of 2.2+/-0.5 microM determined by steady-state kinetics and a kcat of 56+/-7 s(-1) determined by single-turnover kinetics. Tetrafluoroaluminate (AlF4-), which stabilizes complexes of other Ras family members with their cognate GAPs, also stabilized a complex of Arf 1-GDP with ASAP1. As anticipated, mutation of Arg-497 to a lysine residue affected kcat to a much greater extent than K(m). Changing Trp-479, Iso-490, Arg-505, Leu-511 or Asp-512 was predicted, based on previous studies, to affect affinity for Arf 1-GTP. Instead, these mutations primarily affected the k(cat). Mutants that lacked activity in vitro similarly lacked activity in an in vivo assay of ASAP1 function, the inhibition of dorsal ruffle formation.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Branched-chain amino acid ( BCAA )-enriched nutrient solutions reduce gut atrophy associated with parenteral nutrition. We hypothesized that this effect was mediated by phosphate-dependent glutaminase. Thirty male Wistar rats (300-350 g) underwent a standardized surgical procedure and were then randomized into three groups to receive 6 days of ad libitum enteral nutrition. The animals were fed a solution of conventional nutrients, a solution of conventional nutrients enriched with 2.0% BCAA or a solution of conventional parenteral nutrients enriched with 2.5% glutamine. When compared with rats fed conventional nutrients, rats fed BCAA and glutamine had less jejunal atrophy (P  0.05) and a greater specific activity of phosphate-dependent glutaminase in the jejunum (131%; P  0.05).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

N-Formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) is a potent activator of neutrophil degranulation. The intracellular signaling mechanisms involved in the potentiating effect of fibrinogen on fMLP-induced primary granule release from human neutrophils were investigated. Fibrinogen caused a significant leftward shift of the concentration-response curve of fMLP-induced elastase release. An antibody against Mac-1 (CD11b/ CD18 ) prevented the potentiating effect of fibrinogen, suggesting that soluble fibrinogen potentiates fMLP-induced degranulating effect by a mechanism mediated by the integrin Mac-1. Fibrinogen enhanced fMLP-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in human neutrophils and markedly enhanced the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) caused by fMLP. However, U0126, an inhibitor of p44/42 MAPK activation, or SB-203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK, did not alter the effect of fibrinogen on fMLP-induced elastase release. Wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) kinase inhibitor, and genistein, a nonspecific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, strongly inhibited fMLP-induced elastase release both in the presence and in the absence of fibrinogen. An Akt/PKB inhibitor failed to alter the potentiating effect of fibrinogen, suggesting that the effect of fibrinogen is mediated by Akt-independent pathways.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

1. Caesium ions ( Cs+ ), applied extracellularly, caused a decrease in the input resistance of cultured spinal cord (s.c.) neurones and depolarized the neurones when they contained 140 mM-CsCl. 2. The reversal potential for Cs+ -activated currents shifted 56 mV on average for a 10-fold reduction in the intracellular chloride ion (Cl-) activity, indicating that the Cs+ -activated currents were specific to Cl-. 3. The activation of Cl- currents by Cs+ was not due to the depolarization-evoked release of neurotransmitter from presynaptic terminals. We therefore suggest that Cs+ were acting directly on the extracellular surface of the s.c. neurones to activate Cl- currents. 4. Cs+ -activated currents showed desensitization in the presence of 140 mM- Cs+. 5. The log-log plot of the dose-response data could be fitted with a straight line with a slope of 1.7 +/- 0.4 (n = 6), indicating that at least 2 Cs+ were needed to activate a single Cl- channel. The KD of the Cs+ -induced response was greater than 69 mM. 6. In outside-out patches Cs+ activated single Cl- channel s. These channels were not activated by sodium or potassium ions. 7. The Cs+ -activated channels displayed a total of five distinct conductance states which had mean conductances of 20, 30, 43, 66 and 92 pS. The 30 and 43 pS states were the most frequently occurring states. 8.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the intracellular mediators of the third base mutant of codon 249 in p53 gene ( p53 mt249) mutation that potentiate IGF-II dependent IGF-I receptor ( IGF-IR ) signaling. p53 mt249 enhanced IGF-II dependent IGF-IR signaling in p53 negative Hep3B hepatoma cells which were specifically prevented by IGF-IR antibody, alpha IR3 and lovastin. p53 mt249 increased the number of IGF-II binding sites with no change in the affinity of IGF-IR. Enhanced levels of IGF-IR expression and transcription were identified in p53 mt249 transfected Hep3B cells. Pre-transfection of cultured hepatoma cells with p53 mt249 resulted in a three to fourfold increase in IGF-IR phosphorylation and downstream mediator IRS-I phosphorylation but, enhanced more than 15-fold after IGF-II treatment, which coincides well with the cell growth and thymidine uptake results.

Twenty-one days after surgery, the rats were placed in metabolic cages where they received either a normal diet (S and K rats) or a similar one containing N (18 mg/day) (SN and KN rats) during 3 weeks. Arterial pressure and body weight were measured twice a week.

In the remaining hearts, the left ventricular papillary muscle was excised and mounted in a bath where the developed tension (dt) and the maximal rate of rise of developed tension (+T) were recorded in basal conditions, and after cumulative doses of isoproterenol (10(-11) to 10(-4) M). The arterial pressure, ventricular weight, and cardiac proteins were similar in S, SN, and KN groups and were significantly higher in the K group (p less than 0.05).

Inhibition of calmodulin (CaM) sensitizes Ca2 + release mediated by D-myo-inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate ( InsP3 ) in Xenoplus oocytes, which results in spontaneous Ca2 + -dependent Cl- current oscillations or in a shift of the concentration threshold for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) by a tenfold factor. The oscillatory currents appear at a low initial Ca2 + concentration and without any significant increase in the inositol phosphate (InsPs) concentrations. These data led us to rule out the direct involvement of CaM, as well as the implied involvement of InsP3 3-kinase. The response to intracellular injection of the non-metabolizable InsP3 analog 3-deoxy-3-fluoro InsP3 ( InsP3 -F) is obviously affected by previous treatment with CaM inhibitory peptide. Furthermore, these effects have been consistently obtained with specific CaMKII inhibitors such as KN-93 and AIP. CaM plays a key role in the Ca2 +-dependent inactivation of type I InsP3 receptors.

The prognostic value of the oestradiol flare-up in response to gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist was evaluated in 140 in-vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles programmed by progestogen pretreatment. Three days after the end of administration of norethisterone, a routinely used short-term DTRP6 GnRH agonist protocol was started (designated day 1), gonadotrophins being introduced from day 4. Serum oestradiol flare-up values were evaluated on days 1, 2 and 3 to study their relationship with the subsequent IVF outcome. On day 2, 87.9% of the cycles exhibited a significant rise in serum oestradiol concentration from baseline (delta E2 > or = 5 pg/ml). Compared to cycles without any significant oestradiol increase, they had a higher pregnancy rate per transfer (33.3 versus 9.1%, P = 0.02), although the number of transferred embryos did not differ significantly. Taking into account the previously described cut-off value (doubling from baseline), we found that less than half of the cycles (45.7%) involved a doubling of oestradiol values during flare-up, and we did not observe any significant difference in IVF outcome in these cycles compared to those without doubling.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Ewes were maintained at high altitude (3,820 m) from 40 to 138-141 days gestation when FACs were collected and challenged with either ACTH (10 nM) or 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-bromo-cAMP, 10 mM) in the presence or absence of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (MEK)/ERK inhibitor UO126 (10 M). FACs from age-matched normoxic fetuses served as controls. Media and FACs were collected at selected time intervals after ACTH or 8-bromo-cAMP stimulation for cortisol measurement and Western analysis of ERK1/2 and phospho-ERK1 and -2 ( pERK 1/2). After ACTH or 8-bromo-cAMP treatment, cortisol production was greater in the LTH group compared with control (P  0.05). UO126 reduced ACTH and 8-bromo-cAMP-mediated cortisol output in both groups (P  0.01 vs. ACTH or 8-bromo-cAMP alone). Under basal conditions, ERK1/2 and pERK 1/2 were not different between LTH and normoxic fetuses.

SPM did not affect discoidal rHDL size or surface charge. Esterification of cholesterol by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase ( LCAT ) was inhibited in the SPM -containing discoidal rHDL. When the discoidal rHDL of POPC/ SPM /UC/apoA-I molar ratio 99.6/0.0/10.2/1.0 were incubated with low density lipoproteins (LDL) and LCAT, SPM transferred spontaneously from the LDL to the rHDL (t1/2 = 0.8 h) and spherical particles with a POPC/ SPM /UC/CE/apoA-I molar ratio of 24.6/4.9/3. 6/24.9/1.0 were formed.

The Drosophila homeotic gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx) is regulated by complex mechanisms that specify the spatial domain, the timing and the activity of the gene in individual tissues and in individual cells. In early embryonic development, Ubx expression is controlled by segmentation genes turned on earlier in the developmental hierarchy. Correct Ubx expression depends on multiple regulatory sequences located outside the basal promoter. Here we report that a 500 bp DNA fragment from the bx region of the Ubx unit, approximately 30 kb away from the promoter, contains one of the distant regulatory elements (bx region enhancer, BRE). During early embryogenesis, this enhancer element activates the Ubx promoter in parasegments (PS) 6, 8, 10, and 12 and represses it in the anterior half of the embryo. The repressor of the anterior Ubx expression is the gap gene hunchback ( hb ).

The histamine H2-receptor antagonists cimetidine, ranitidine and tiotidine suppressed NK cell cytotoxicity ( NKCC ) at a high concentration (10(-3) M). Cimetidine enhanced NKCC of Ficoll-Hypaque-separated lymphocytes and of lymphocytes enriched for NKCC by Percoll density gradient centrifugation.

Gonadotrophins including LH have been suggested to play an important role in the etiology of epithelial ovarian cancers. The goal of the present study was to obtain more insight in the mechanism of gonadotrophin action on ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) cells. As the Fas system is known to be a major player in the regulation of the process of apoptosis in the ovary, we investigated whether LH interfered with Fas -induced apoptosis in the human OSE cancer cell lines HEY and Caov-3. Activation of Fas receptor by an agonistic anti- Fas receptor antibody induced apoptosis, as was evaluated by caspase-3 activation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase fragmentation, phosphatidylserine externalization and morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. Co-treatment with LH reduced the number of apoptotic cells following activation of Fas in a transient manner, while LH by itself did not affect apoptosis or cell proliferation.

Higher serum level of p-cresol (PC) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients has been linked with CKD progression. The toxic effect of PC on diverse cells has been reported by prior studies, except for renal tubular cells. Both autophagy and apoptosis contribute to renal tubular cell death, yet evidence of its response to PC is limited and their crosstalk is still unclear. Autophagy is an important cellular process involved in toxin-induced cell death. Renal tubular cell death in tubular injury is thought to be one of the key events causing the progression of CKD. Thus, we treated rat (NRK-52E) and human (HRPTEC) renal proximal tubular cells (RPTC) with PC and found the cell proliferation was significantly decreased. Cell apoptosis was significantly increased and accompanied with the activation of autophagy as evidenced by increases in LC3-II, beclin 1 and Atg 4. We also found an increase of p62 by c-Jun activation. p62 accumulation could mediate the activation of caspase 8 -dependent cell apoptosis.

The effects of the somatostatin analogue, octreotide on postural hypotension have been compared with placebo, before and after food ingestion in two groups with primary autonomic failure; patients with pure autonomic failure, and patients with additional neurological involvement as part of multiple system atrophy. After placebo, supine blood pressure was unchanged, but after octreotide, it rose in both groups. Octreotide reduced pre-prandial postural and supine post-prandial hypotension in both pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy patients. Postural hypotension post-prandially was considerably worse after placebo; this was reduced after octreotide. Plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline levels remained unchanged. Plasma glucose levels rose higher and faster after placebo. Insulin levels were similar in both groups at rest, but rose higher in patients with pure autonomic failure after placebo. After octreotide, the insulin response in both groups was suppressed.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

To examine the role of excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters in the regulation of LH and FSH secretion in ovariectomized (ovx) adult rats treated with estradiol and progesterone, we measured the release rates of the excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters, glutamate and aspartate, as well as the neurally inactive amino acid serine in microdialysis perfusate samples of the preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus collected at 30-min intervals during the LH surge induced by progesterone. The concentrations of the amino acids were measured by assay using orthophthalaldehyde prederivatization followed by HPLC coupled with fluorometric detection. The release rates of glutamate in the POA increased at 15:30 and 16:00 h in the progesterone -treated estrogen-primed ovx rat as compared to estrogen controls. Release rates of aspartate in the POA were increased at 12:00, 12:30, 15:00 and 16:00 h in the progesterone -treated estrogen-primed ovx rat as compared to estrogen controls. The increase in POA release rates of glutamate and aspartate in the progesterone -treated rats occurred immediately prior to peak serum LH levels induced by progesterone. The specificity of the increase in POA release rates of glutamate and aspartate was evidenced by the finding that the preoptic release of neurally inactive neurotransmitter serine was unchanged by steroid treatment. Estradiol alone had no significant effect on the POA release rates of glutamate, aspartate or serine as compared to ovariectomized controls.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Acetoin, a major extracellular catabolic product of Bacillus subtilis cultured on glucose, is widely used to add flavor to food and also serves as a precursor for chemical synthesis. The biosynthesis of acetoin from pyruvate requires the enzymes -acetolactate synthase ( ALS ) and -acetolactate decarboxylase (ALDC), both of which are encoded by the alsSD operon. The transcriptional regulator ALsR is essential for the expression of alsSD. Here we focused on enhancing the production of acetoin by B. subtilis using different promoters to express ALsR. The expression of reporter genes was much higher under the control of the HpaII promoter than under control of the P bdhA promoter. Although the HpaII promoter highly enhanced transcription of the alsSD operon through overexpression of ALsR, the production of acetoin was not significantly increased. In contrast, moderate enhancement of ALsR expression using the P bdhA promoter significantly improved acetoin production. Compared with the wild-type, the enzyme activities of ALS and ALDC in B. subtilis harboring P bdhA were increased by approximately twofold, and the molar yield of acetoin from glucose was improved by 62.9 % in shake flask fermentation. In a 5-L fermentor, the engineered B. subtilis ultimately yielded 41.5 g/L of acetoin.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

GAGE-1/-2 proteins are novel tumour markers, functionally related to tumour rejection. The objective of the present study was to identify the existence of a relationship between GAGE-1/-2 expression, Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection and viral infection-induced cytokine expression in cultivated tumour cells and archival specimens of undifferentiated carcinoma of nasopharyngeal type (UCNT). PCR and in situ hybridization techniques were employed. In cultivated UCNT cells, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) induced synthesis of GAGE-1/-2 mRNA.

Neutrophil elastase ( NE ) is an innate immune cell-derived inflammatory mediator that we have shown increases the presentation of tumor -associated peptide antigens in breast cancer. In this study, we extend these observations to show that NE uptake has a broad effect on enhancing antigen presentation by breast cancer cells. We show that NE increases human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I expression on the surface of breast cancer cells in a concentration and time-dependent manner. HLA class I upregulation requires internalization of enzymatically active NE. Western blots of NE -treated breast cancer cells confirm that the expression of total HLA class I as well as the antigen-processing machinery proteins TAP1, LMP2, and calnexin does not change following NE treatment. This suggests that NE does not increase the efficiency of antigen processing; rather, it mediates the upregulation of HLA class I by stabilizing and reducing membrane recycling of HLA class I molecules. Furthermore, the effects of NE extend beyond breast cancer since the uptake of NE by EBV-LCL increases the presentation of HLA class I-restricted viral peptides, as shown by their increased sensitivity to lysis by EBV-specific CD8+ T cells.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We hypothesized that dichloroacetate ( DCA ), which stimulates the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH), would attenuate the increase in muscle tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates ( TCAI ) during exercise by increasing the oxidative disposal of pyruvate and attenuating the flux through anaplerotic pathways. Six subjects were infused with either saline (Con) or DCA (100 mg/kg body mass) and then performed a moderate leg kicking exercise for 15 min, followed immediately by intense exercise until exhaustion (Exh; approximately 4 min). Resting active fraction of PDH (PDH(a)) was markedly increased (P /= 0.05) after DCA vs. Con (2.65 +/- 0.27 vs. 0.64 +/- 0.07 mmol. min(-1). kg wet wt(-1)); however, there were no differences between trials after 1 or 15 min of exercise or at Exh. The sum of five measured TCAI (SigmaTCAI; approximately 90% of total TCAI pool) was lower (P /= 0.05) after DCA vs. Con at rest (0. 78 +/- 0.11 vs. 1.52 +/- 0.23 mmol/kg dry wt, respectively). However, the net increase in muscle TCAI during the first minute of exercise was higher (P /= 0.05) in the DCA trial vs. Con (3.05 +/- 0.45 vs. 2.44 +/- 0.55 mmol. min(-1). kg dry wt(-1), respectively), and consequently, the SigmaTCAI was not different between trials during exercise.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We demonstrated previously that in serum-starved MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, Ang II increased Na+/K+ATPase activity and activated the protein kinase C zeta (PKC-zeta) (Muscella et al., 2002 J Endocrinol 173:315-323; 2003 J Cell Physiol 197:61-68.). The aim of the present study was to investigate the modulation of the activity of the Na+/K+ATPase by PKC-zeta in MCF-7 cells. Here, using serum-starved MCF-7 cells, we have demonstrated that the effect of Ang II on the Na+/K+ATPase activity was inhibited by a synthetic myristoylated peptide with sequences based on the endogenous PKC-zeta pseudosubstrate region (zeta-PS) and by high doses of GF109203X, inhibitor of PKCs. When MCF-7 cells, grown in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), were stimulated with Ang II a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of the Na+/K+ATPase activity was obtained. Under this growth condition we found that mRNAs for AT1, AT2, and for Na+/K+ATPase alpha1 and alpha3 subunits were unchanged; besides both the activity of the Na+/K+ATPase and the level of PKC-zeta also were unaffected by the serum. The atypical PKC-iota level (present in very low abundance in serum-starved MCF-7) was increased and Ang II provoked its translocation from the cytosol to plasma membrane. PKC-zeta was localized to the membrane, and upon Ang II treatment its cellular localization did not change.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) results from a failure of B lymphoid development. We have previously examined pre-B cell hybrids from three patients with XLA and found them to be limited to production of a novel germ line transcript of the Ig H chain locus composed of a leader sequence (LS) spliced to the constant region of mu chain (C mu) as mRNA and polypeptide. These transcripts result from transcriptional activation of the germ line heavy chain locus from an LS exon upstream of the embryonic JH locus. Germ line LS-C mu transcripts are produced by pre-B cells from normal bone marrow and fetal liver, indicating that they are products of normal pre-B cell development, as part of the process of transcriptional activation to provide access for the recombinase. Bone marrow from three patients with XLA has been examined directly by polymerase chain reaction amplification to determine whether the exclusive production of LS-C mu by XLA pre-B cell hybrids is representative of XLA pre-B cells. I report that LS-C mu is the predominant Ig molecule produced by XLA pre-B cells, with limited production of the D mu product of DJH intermediate stage of V(D)J recombination.

Vascular calcification (VC) is a degenerative disease that contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A negative relationship has been demonstrated between VC and calcium sensing receptor ( CaSR ) expression in the vasculature. Of interest, vitamin D response elements, which allow responsiveness to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25( OH )2D3], are present in the promoters of the CaSR gene. We hypothesized that 1,25( OH )2D3, by modulating CaSR expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), might protect against VC. Human VSMCs were exposed to increasing concentrations of 1,25( OH )2D3 (0.01-10 nmol/L) in noncalcifying (1.8 mmol/L) or procalcifying Ca(2+)0 condition (5.0 mmol/L). Using quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting we observed a significant increase in both CaSR mRNA and protein levels after exposure to 1.0 nmol/L 1,25( OH )2D3. This effect was associated with a maximal increase in CaSR expression at the cell surface after 48 hours of 1,25( OH )2D3 treatment, as assessed by flow cytometry. Down-regulation of the vitamin D receptor by small interfering RNA abolished these effects. In the procalcifying condition, 1.0 nmol/L 1,25( OH )2D3 blocked the Ca(2+)0-induced decrease in total and surface CaSR expression and protected against mineralization. Down-regulation of CaSR expression by CaSR small interfering RNA abolished this protective effect. 1,25( OH )2D3 concentrations of 0.5 and 5.0 nmol/L were also effective, but other (0.01, 0.1, and 10 nmol/L) concentrations did not modify CaSR expression and human VSMC mineralization.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) agonists represent potentially useful cancer vaccine adjuvants in their ability to stimulate antigen-presenting cells ( APC s) and subsequently amplify the cytotoxic T-cell response. The purpose of this study was to characterize APC responses to TLR activation and to determine the subsequent effect on lymphocyte activation. We exposed murine primary bone marrow-derived macrophages to increasing concentrations of agonists to TLR s 2, 3, 4, and 9. This resulted in a dose-dependent increase in production of not only tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), a surrogate marker of the proinflammatory response, but also interleukin 10 (IL-10), a well-described inhibitory cytokine. Importantly, IL-10 secretion was not induced by low concentrations of TLR agonists that readily produced TNF-. We subsequently stimulated lymphocytes with anti-CD3 antibody in the presence of media from macrophages activated with higher doses of TLR agonists and observed suppression of interferon gamma release. Use of both IL-10 knockout macrophages and IL-10 small-interfering RNA (siRNA) ablated this suppressive effect. Finally, IL-10 siRNA was successfully used to suppress CpG-induced IL-10 production in vivo.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Studies were conducted with rats to investigate whether exposure to carbon monoxide ( CO ) at concentrations frequently found in the environment caused lung injury mediated by nitric oxide (* NO )-derived oxidants. Lung capillary leakage was significantly increased 18 h after rats had been exposed to CO at concentrations of 50 ppm or more for 1 h. An elevation of * NO during CO exposure was demonstrated by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. There was a 2.6-fold increase of * NO over control in the lungs of rats exposed to 100 ppm CO. A qualitative increase in the concentration of H2O2 was also detected in lungs during CO exposure, and this change was caused by * NO as it was inhibited in rats pretreated with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, Nomega nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME). Production of * NO -derived oxidants during CO exposure was indicated by an elevated concentration of nitrotyrosine in lung homogenates. The CO -associated elevations in lung capillary leakage and nitrotyrosine concentration did not occur when rats were pretreated with l-NAME.

We wished to determine if mild hypocapnia above the "apneic threshold" would result in apnea or hypopnea during NREM sleep. Hypocapnia was induced by nasal mechanical hyperventilation for 1 min either under normoxia (51 trials, n = 7) or hyperoxia (43 trials, n = 5). Cessation of mechanical ventilation resulted in hypopnea due to reduced VT without a change in f. Central apnea occurred mostly under hyperoxic conditions (9/43 versus 2/51 trials under normoxic conditions), and only when complete inhibition of ventilatory motor output occurred during mechanical ventilation. Significant correlation between the magnitude of hypocapnia and nadir VE was noted under both normoxic and hyperoxic conditions. However, nadir VE was variable when hypocapnia was modest (-2 mmHg); further hypocapnia (-4 mmHg) was associated with consistent reduction in nadir VE below 30% of control under normoxic conditions, and central apnea under hyperoxic conditions.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The present study characterized the TGR5 expression and the signaling pathways coupled to this receptor that mediates the relaxation of gastric smooth muscle. TGR5 was detected in gastric muscle cells by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Treatment of cells with the TGR5-selective ligand oleanolic acid (OA) activated Gs, but not Gq, Gi1, Gi2, or Gi3, and increased cAMP levels. OA did not elicit contraction, but caused relaxation of carbachol-induced contraction of gastric muscle cells from wild-type mice, but not tgr5(-/-) mice. OA, but not a selective exchange protein activated by cAMP ( Epac ) ligand (8-pCPT-2'-O-Me- cAMP ), caused phosphorylation of RhoA and the phosphorylation was blocked by the PKA inhibitor, myristoylated PKI, and by the expression of phosphorylation-deficient mutant RhoA (S188A). Both OA and Epac ligand stimulated Ras-related protein 1 (Rap1) and inhibited carbachol (CCh)-induced Rho kinase activity. Expression of RhoA (S188A) or PKI partly reversed the inhibition of Rho kinase activity by OA but had no effect on inhibition by Epac ligand. However, suppression of Rap1 with siRNA blocked the inhibition of Rho kinase by Epac ligand, and partly reversed the inhibition by OA; the residual inhibition was blocked by PKI.

Increased NAD(P)H oxidase -dependent free radical generation has been proposed to be a mechanism in glycerol-induced acute renal failure ( ARF ). Previously, we showed a PPAR-mediated regulation of free radical generation in ARF.

Male gp91phox (+/-) or wild type (+/+) mice were distributed into vehicle and ARF group (50% glycerol; 8 mL/kg bw; i.m.). Animals were placed in metabolic cages for 24 hr and were sacrificed under pentobarbital anesthesia. Urine, plasma and kidneys were processed for biochemical and molecular analysis. Glycerol doubled proteinuria in (+/+) mice (68  4 mg/24 hr) but not in (+/-) mice (43  9 mg/24 hr). This was associated with a markedly reduced creatinine excretion in (+/+) mice (Con: 0.6  0.03 & ARF : 0.37  0.02). Basal plasma and urinary NO was higher in (+/-) mice than the (+/+) type while plasma 8-isoprostane level was lower in (+/-) mice (WT: 165  20; KO: 100  15 pg/mL).

Glycerol also doubled 8-isoprostane in (+/+) (363  22 pg/mL) but not in (+/-) mice (152  20 pg/mL) and this was associated with an increased NAD(P)H oxidase activity in the (+/+) mice.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/vascular permeability factor (VPF), an endothelial cell (EC)-specific mitogen, stimulates angiogenesis in vivo, particularly in ischemic regions. VEGF/VPF expression by cells of hypoxic tissues coincides with expression of its two receptors, KDR and flt-1, by ECs in the same tissues. We investigated whether hypoxia or hypoxia-dependent conditions operate in coordinating this phenomenon. Human umbilical vein and microvascular ECs were exposed to direct hypoxia or to medium conditioned (CM) by myoblasts maintained in hypoxia for 4 d. Control ECs were maintained in normoxia or normoxia-CM. Binding of 125I-VEGF to ECs was then evaluated. Hypoxic treatment of ECs had no effect on 125I-VEGF binding. However, treatment of ECs with hypoxia-CM produced a threefold increase in 125I-VEGF binding, with peak at 24 h (P  0.001, ANOVA). Scatchard analysis disclosed that increased binding was due to a 13-fold increase in KDR receptors/cell, with no change in KDR affinity (Kd = 260 +/- 51 pM, normoxia-CM versus Kd = 281 +/- 94 pM, hypoxia-CM) and no change in EC number (35.6 +/- 5.9 x 10(3) ECs /cm2, normoxia-CM versus 33.5 +/- 5.5 x 10(3) ECs /cm2, hypoxia-CM). Similar results were obtained using CM from hypoxic smooth muscle cells. KDR upregulation was not prevented by addition to the hypoxia-CM of neutralizing antibodies against VEGF, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, transforming growth factor beta 1 or basic fibroblast growth factor.

Oral 200-mg doses of indomethacin administered 15 h and 2 h before testing is known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis by 90%, as determined by prostaglandin E2 generation assay on endoscopically obtained gastric mucosal biopsy specimens. Fat-induced inhibition of gastric acid secretion was evaluated by intragastric administration of 200 ml vegetable oil or glucose (control) for 30 min, followed by intragastric titration with peptone at pH 5.5 for 2 h. The mean acid output was significantly lower after fat (8 +/- 0.2 mmol 30 min-1) as compared with control (12 +/- 0.5 mmol 30 min-1). The fat -induced inhibition was unaffected by indomethacin treatment, and the plasma gastrin responses were similar in all groups.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Fast synaptic transmission between olfactory receptor neurons and mitral cells ( MCs ) is mediated through AMPA and NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptors. MCs also express high levels of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 ( mGluR1 ) whose functional significance is less understood. Here we characterized a slow mGluR1 -mediated potential that was evoked by high-frequency (100-Hz) olfactory nerve (ON) stimulation in the presence of NBQX and D-APV, blockers of ionotropic glutamate receptors, and that was associated with a local Ca2+ transient in the MC dendritic tuft. High-frequency ON stimulation in the presence of NBQX and D-APV also evoked a slow, nearly 2-Hz oscillation of MC membrane potential that was abolished by the mGluR1 antagonist LY367385 (50 microM). Both mGluR slow potential and slow oscillation persisted in the presence of gabazine (10 microM), a GABA(A) receptor antagonist, and intracellular QX-314 (10 mM), a Na+ channel blocker. In contrast to a slow mGluR1 potential in cerebellar Purkinje neurons, the MC mGluR1 potential was not depressed by SKF96365 ( or =250 microM) and thus is likely not mediated by TRPC1 cation channels, nor was it potentiated by an elevation of intracellular Ca2+ level. Imaging with the Na+ indicator SBFI revealed a Na+ transient in the MC dendrite accompanying the mGluR1 slow potential.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) improve insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant rodents. However, the effects of these fatty acids on insulin secretion are not known but are of importance to completely understand their influence on glucose homeostasis. We therefore examined islet function after dietary supplementation consisting of 1% CLAs in combination with 1% n-3 enriched PUFAs for 12 wk to mice on a normal diet and to insulin-resistant mice fed a high-fat diet (58% fat). In the mice fed a normal diet, CLA/PUFA supplementation resulted in insulin resistance associated with low plasma adiponectin levels and low body fat content. Intravenous and oral glucose tolerance tests revealed a marked increase in insulin secretion, which nevertheless was insufficient to counteract the insulin resistance, resulting in glucose intolerance. In freshly isolated islets from mice fed the normal diet, both basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion were adaptively augmented by CLA/PUFA, and at a high glucose concentration this was accompanied by elevated glucose oxidation. In contrast, in high-fat-fed mice, CLA/PUFA did not significantly affect insulin secretion, insulin resistance, or glucose tolerance.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
It is concluded that dietary supplementation of CLA/PUFA in <el> mice <le> fed the normal diet augments <re> insulin secretion <er>, partly because of increased islet glucose oxidation, but that this augmentation is insufficient to counterbalance the induction of insulin resistance, resulting in glucose intolerance. positive----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

Myocardial cells utilize membrane transport systems for proton extrusion as well as internal buffers to preserve pH homeostasis. Our laboratory had shown previously that amiloride (0.01-1.0 mM) causes a time- and dose-dependent increase in action potential duration, early after depolarizations and enhanced automaticity. Ion-selective microelectrode technique was used to evaluate whether the observed electrophysiologic effects of amiloride are linked to inhibition of Na/H exchange and subsequent inability of the myocardial cell to maintain steady-state intracellular pH (pHi), either under normal physiological conditions or in the presence of an imposed acid load. We analyzed different components of intracellular pH transients that occur in response to NH4Cl exposure and washout, which allowed us to quantitatively describe the effects of Na/H exchange inhibition in a multicellular preparation. Amiloride (0.01-1.0 mM) did not change the steady-state pHi, but did cause a dose-dependent increase in both the time for the pHi to reach a minimum value (time-to-peak) during washout of NH4Cl as well as in the absolute minimum value of pHi (peak acid). The effects of amiloride on pHi transients are rapidly reversible and antagonized by physiologic values of extracellular sodium activity.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is a calcium-permeable non-selective cation channel that is mainly expressed in primary nociceptive neurons. TRPA1 is activated by a variety of noxious stimuli, including cold temperatures, pungent compounds such as mustard oil and cinnamaldehyde, and intracellular alkalization. Here, we show that primary alcohols, which have been reported to cause skin, eye or nasal irritation, activate human TRPA1 ( hTRPA1 ). We measured intracellular Ca(2+) changes in HEK293 cells expressing hTRPA1 induced by 1 mM primary alcohols. Higher alcohols (1-butanol to 1-octanol) showed Ca(2+) increases proportional to the carbon chain length. In whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, higher alcohols (1-hexanol to 1-octanol) activated hTRPA1 and the potency increased with the carbon chain length. Higher alcohols evoked single-channel opening of hTRPA1 in an inside-out configuration. In addition, cysteine at 665 in the N terminus and histidine at 983 in the C terminus were important for hTRPA1 activation by primary alcohols. Furthermore, straight-chain secondary alcohols increased intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations in HEK293 cells expressing hTRPA1, and both primary and secondary alcohols showed hTRPA1 activation activities that correlated highly with their octanol/water partition coefficients. On the other hand, mouse TRPA1 did not show a strong response to 1-hexanol or 1-octanol, nor did these alcohols evoke significant pain in mice.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

IGF-I stimulated TE and total protein synthesis in a dose-dependent manner even when cells were cultured in the medium supplemented with 0.5% FCS. The maximal stimulation was at IGF-I concentration 500 ng/mL and was an increase of 86 +/- 14 and 35 +/- 5% for TE and estimated total protein synthesis, respectively. There was a corresponding 95 +/- 20% increase in the TE mRNA/beta-actin mRNA ratio assessed by densitometry of the Northern blot analysis.

Abnormalities in lungs caused by emphysema might alter their response to sepsis and the occurrence of acute lung injury (ALI). This study compared the extension of ALI in response to intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection in Wistar rats with and without emphysema induced by elastase. Adult male Wistar rats were randomized into four groups: control, emphysema without sepsis, normal lung with sepsis and emphysema with sepsis. Sepsis was induced, and 24 h later the rats were euthanised. The following analysis was performed: blood gas measurements, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), lung permeability and histology. Animals that received LPS showed significant increase in a lung injury scoring system, inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and IL-6, TNF- and CXCL2 mRNA expression in lung tissue.

Myxofibrosarcoma is genetically complex and lacks effective nonsurgical treatment strategies; thus, elucidation of novel molecular drivers is urgently needed. Reanalyzing public myxofibrosarcoma datasets, we identified mRNA upregulation and recurrent gain of RSF1 and characterized this chromatin remodeling gene. Myxofibrosarcoma cell lines were employed to elucidate the oncogenic mechanisms of RSF1 by genetic manipulation and two IL-1-neutralizing antibodies (RD24, P2D7KK), highlighting the regulatory basis and targetability of downstream IL-1-mediated angiogenesis. Tumor samples were assessed for RSF1, IL-1, and microvascular density (MVD) by immunohistochemistry and for RSF1 gene status by FISH. In vivo, RSF1 -silenced and P2D7KK-treated xenografts were analyzed for tumor-promoting effects and the IL-1-linked therapeutic relevance of RSF1, respectively. In vitro, RSF1 overexpression promoted invasive and angiogenic phenotypes with a stronger proangiogenic effect. RT-PCR profiling identified IL1B as a top-ranking candidate upregulated by RSF1. RSF1 required hSNF2H and CEBP/ to cotransactivate the IL1B promoter, which increased the IL1B mRNA level, IL-1 secretion and angiogenic capacity. Angiogenesis induced by RSF1 -upregulated IL-1 was counteracted by IL1B knockdown and both IL-1-neutralizing antibodies. Clinically, RSF1 overexpression was highly associated with RSF1 amplification, IL-1 overexpression, increased MVD and higher grades (all P  0.01) and independently predicted shorter disease-specific survival (P = 0.019, hazard ratio: 4.556).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Human squamous cell carcinomas frequently overexpress the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) and this is often associated with poor prognosis in patients with these cancers. The high level of expression of the EGFR provides an important target for therapy and we and others have shown that monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) which block the activation of the receptor by the EGF family of ligands inhibit the growth of EGFR overexpressing tumours in vitro and induce the regression of established tumours grown as xenografts in athymic mice. Inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase associated with the EGFR have also been shown to block receptor activation and prevent tumour cell proliferation. Using the EGFR -overexpressing head and neck carcinoma cell line HN5, we have compared the biological consequences of treatment with an inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase (PD153035) with anti- EGFR monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) ICR63 or ICR80. We found that both the anti- EGFR mAbs and the TK inhibitor produce similar biological changes namely, they inhibit the EGF and TGFá-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor and the growth in culture of HN5 cells. At concentrations above 100 nM, the TK inhibitor prevented the growth in culture of HN5 cells completely with an IC50 of 40 nM. With the anti- EGFR mAbs, growth of HN5 cells was inhibited completely at concentrations above 4 nM with an IC50 of 1 nM. More importantly we found that, like the anti- EGFR mAbs, treatment with the TK inhibitor directs HN5 cells to undergo terminal differentiation as monitored by the expression of cytokeratin 10. In addition, our results indicate that the growth inhibitory effects of the anti- EGFR agents also lead to induction of apoptosis as determined by 7-amino actinomycin D staining (7-AAD).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Nevertheless, this disease has been reported only once in conjunction with a Cimino-Brescia arteriovenous fistula, and no attention has been paid to the potential complications of this disease. In the present paper 3 cases are reported. In 1 patient pseudo-Kaposi's sarcoma was complicated by an infected open wound as a consequence of a trauma. In the 2 other patients, a skin biopsy was followed by local infection and retarded healing of the wound. Evaluation by fistula graphy and/or Doppler revealed venous outflow stenosis in only 1 case.

Glycerol induced acute renal failure ( ARF ) is known to attenuate subsequent mercuric chloride nephrotoxicity. This protection was evaluated in rats. Glycerol induced varying degrees of renal insufficiency. After 14 days, when serum creatinine (SCr) creatinine clearance (CCr) and fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) had returned to baseline, injection of mercuric chloride caused significantly milder renal insufficiency in recovered rats than in controls (SCr 356 +/- 46 vs. 475 +/- 19 mumol/L; CCr 0.12 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.02 +/- 0.02 mL/min, p .05; and mortality 0 vs. 45%, respectively, p .01). A striking finding was that the degree of renal insufficiency induced by mercuric chloride correlated inversely with the degree of renal insufficiency previously induced by glycerol (r = -0.496, p .05 for SCr and CCr), but there was no correlation with other measures of previous renal function such as urine volume, sodium excretion, or FENa. Glycerol induced ARF also attenuated the renal toxicity of mercuric chloride injected 4 days after glycerol, before full recovery of renal function. The decrements in renal function after the two insults were also inversely related (r = -0.76, p .01). A third renal insult with a second mercuric chloride injection after three weeks was still attenuated. However, after the third insult, there was no longer an inverse or any statistical relationship with previous measurements of renal function.

Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a lipid growth factor with multiple biological functions and has been shown to stimulate cancer cell secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor-A ( VEGF-A ) and trigger angiogenesis. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a heterodimer consisting of HIF-1 and HIF-1 (also known as aromatic hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT)) subunits, is an important regulator of angiogenesis in prostate cancer (PC) through the enhancement of VEGF-A expression. In this study, we first confirmed the ability of LPA to induce VEGF-A expression in PC-3 cells and then validated that LPA-induced VEGF-A expression was regulated by HIF-1 and ARNT through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation. Aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a receptor for dioxin-like compounds, functions as a transcription factor through dimerization with ARNT and was found to inhibit prostate carcinogenesis and vanadate-induced VEGF-A production. Since ARNT is a common dimerization partner of AHR and HIF-1, we hypothesized that AHR might suppress LPA-induced VEGF-A expression in PC-3 cells by competing with HIF-1 for ARNT.

Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) secreted from jejunal mucosal K cells augments insulin secretion and plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of obesity and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. In recent studies, we have shown GIP directly activates Na-glucose cotransporter-1 (SGLT1) and enhances glucose absorption in mouse jejunum. It is not known whether GIP would also regulate other intestinal nutrient absorptive processes. The present study investigated the effect of GIP on proton-peptide cotransporter-1 ( PepT1 ) that mediates di- and tripeptide absorption as well as peptidomimetic drugs. Immunohistochemistry studies localized both GIP receptor (GIPR) and PepT1 proteins on the basolateral and apical membranes of normal mouse jejunum, respectively. Anti-GIPR antibody detected 50-, 55-, 65-, and 70-kDa proteins, whereas anti- PepT1 detected a 70-kDa proteins in mucosal homogenates of mouse jejunum. RT-PCR analyses established the expression of GIPR- and PepT1 -specific mRNA in mucosal cells of mouse jejunum. Absorption of Gly-Sar (a nondigestible dipeptide) measured under voltage-clamp conditions revealed that the imposed mucosal H(+) gradient-enhanced Gly-Sar absorption as an evidence for the presence of PepT1 -mediated H(+):Gly-Sar cotransport on the apical membranes of mouse jejunum. H(+):Gly-Sar absorption was completely inhibited by cephalexin (a competitive inhibitor of PepT1 ) and was activated by GIP.

The crypt and villus epithelium associated with Peyer's patches (PPs) is largely spared from methotrexate ( MTX )-induced damage, compared with the non-patch (NP) epithelium. To assess the mechanism(s) preventing damage to the PP epithelium after MTX treatment, epithelial proliferation, apoptosis, and cell functions were studied in a rat- MTX model. Small intestinal segments containing PPs were excised after MTX treatment. Epithelial proliferation and apoptosis were assessed by detection of incorporated BrdU and cleaved caspase-3, respectively. Epithelial functions were determined by the expression of cell type-specific gene products at mRNA and protein level. Before and after MTX treatment, the number of BrdU-positive cells was higher in PP crypts than in NP crypts. BrdU incorporation was diminished in NP crypts, while in PP crypts incorporation was hardly affected. In PP and NP crypts, similar and increased levels of cleaved caspase-3-positive cells were observed after MTX. The enterocyte markers, sucrase-isomaltase, sodium-glucose co-transporter 1, glucose transporters 2 and 5, and intestinal and liver fatty acid binding protein, were down-regulated after MTX in NP epithelium but not in PP epithelium.

Here, we report the effects of this compound on hypoxia -induced cell death and possible signaling pathways in heart-derived H9c2 cells. Treatment with KR-31378 (3-30 microM) 1 h before and during hypoxia significantly reduced hypoxia -induced cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, increase in hypoxia -induced transferase UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells was reduced by KR-31378, suggesting its antiapoptotic potential in H9c2 cells. The protective effect conferred by KR-31378 (10 microM) was abolished by cotreatment with 5-hydroxydecanoate (5HD), a specific blocker of the mitochondrial KATP (mtKATP) channel, but not by HMR-1883 (1-[[5-[2-(5-chloro-o-anisamido)ethyl]-methoxyphenyl]sulfonyl]-3-methylthiourea), a specific blocker of the sarcolemmal KATP channel.

The metabolism of anandamide by fatty acid amidohydrolase (FAAH) at different intra- and extracellular pH values has been investigated in intact C6 rat glioma cells. The cellular uptake of anandamide at 37 degrees C was found to decrease by 28% when the extracellular pH ( pH (e)) was reduced from pH 7.4 to pH 6.2. In contrast, a selective decrease in intracellular pH ( pH (i)), accomplished by acidifying the cells followed by incubation in sodium-free buffer at pH 7.4, did not affect the uptake. Anandamide uptake was inhibited by (R)- ibuprofen, with pI(50) values of 3.05+/-0.57, 3.66+/-0.23 and 3.94+/-0.88 at pH (e) values of 7.4, 6.8 and 6.2, respectively. In the presence of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, however, (R)- ibuprofen failed to inhibit the uptake of anandamide. A reduction in pH (e) from 7.4 to 6.2 produced a 17% reduction in the FAAH-catalyzed metabolism of anandamide in the intact C6 cells. However, an increased sensitivity of FAAH activity to inhibition by (R)- ibuprofen as well as (R,S)-flurbiprofen and (S)-flurbiprofen was seen at a lower pH (e).

Each received 300 ml of fresh-frozen plasma or 25% albumin with up to 500 ml of crystalloids, in addition to regular maintenance fluids; this treatment increased pulmonary wedge pressure (WP) by 3 to 4 mm Hg. Measurements were performed before and after approximately 5 h of volume loading. Because cardiac index ( CI ) decreased as WP increased in four septic and three nonseptic patients, we grouped the data according to the state of flow instead of the recording time sequence. From low to high flows, mean CI increased in septic patients and nonseptic patients. Oxygen delivery (Do2) increased in septic and nonseptic patients. Vo2 remained unchanged in nonseptic patients, while it increased in septic patients. Accordingly, arteriovenous oxygen difference narrowed in nonseptic patients from 4.46 +/- 1.62 to 3.59 +/- 1.21 ml/dl (p less than.05) but did not change in septic patients. In the septic group, the difference in CI between high and low flows was significantly (p less than.05) greater in survivors than in nonsurvivors.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
We conclude that the septic state is accompanied by a peripheral <el> oxygen <le> deficit, which can be partially reversed by maintaining an above-normal <re> CI <er> and Do2. negative----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

Studies conducted by Fisons Pharmaceuticals and the Antiepileptic Drug Development Program (ADD Program) of the Epilepsy Branch (NINDS, NIH) revealed that'remacemide' (FPL 12924, formerly PR 934-423) was effective orally in the prevention of maximal electroshock seizures ( MES ) in rats. In this context (-)stereoisomer (FPL 14145) was of equal potency to the racemate (remacemide), while the (+)stereoisomer (FPL 14144) was 54% less potent. With respect to neurotoxicity, remacemide and its enantiomers possessed more favorable therapeutic indices than phenobarbital and valproate and less favorable indices than phenytoin and carbamazepine. The duration of protection of rats in the MES test at the ED50 or 3 x ED50 of remacemide and the (+)isomer was better or on par with the best reference compounds, phenytoin and phenobarbital. After subchronic administration of either the ED50 or the ED97 of remacemide, no tolerance developed in the hexobarbital sleep test, however, the activities of 3 hepatic microsomal enzymes were elevated. In naive rats high doses of remacemide or its (-)isomer and low doses of phenobarbital caused an increase in spontaneous motor activity. Alternatively, motor activity was depressed subsequent to high doses of phenobarbital and phenytoin. Remacemide was inactive against pentylenetetrazol and 'kindling' seizures. It was without effect in 5 electrophysiological tests (evoked responses, recurrent inhibition, long-term potentiation, penicillin-induced discharge rate and veratridine-induced depolarization) employing the in vitro hippocampal slice technique.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Apart from soluble growth factors, various other biophysicochemical cues are known to promote chondrogenesis. Under physiological conditions, cartilage in the joint comprises a hyperosmotic and hypoxic environment. Therefore, in this study, we examined the inductive effects of hyperosmotic and/or hypoxic conditions on adipose stem cells (ASCs) and compared them with conventional TGF1-induction. After encapsulation in collagen type II hydrogels and specific induction, ASCs were assessed for viability, proliferation, morphology and chondrogenic differentiation potential. Viability was similar under all conditions, with low proliferative activity. After 4 days, hypoxia and/or hyperosmolarity did not affect round cell morphology, while cells were mainly stretched in the TGF1-induced group. At 21 days, the TGFß1-treated group had aggregated into a cell nodule. Hyperosmolarity mimicked this aggregation to a lesser extent, whereas cells under hypoxia stretched out after 21 days, with a combined effect in the hypoxic/hyperosmotic group. Both individual and combined hyperosmotic and/or hypoxic conditions significantly upregulated SOX5, SOX9, COMP and Link-p gene expression compared with the non-induced group, and to similar levels as the TGF1-induced group. GAG synthesis in both hydrogel and medium was increased under hypoxic conditions, whereas hyperosmolarity decreased GAG formation in the hydrogels, but increased GAG formation in the medium.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Leptin decreases visceral fat (VF) and increases peripheral and hepatic insulin action. Here, we generated similar decreases in VF using leptin (Lep), beta(3)-adrenoreceptor agonism ( beta3 ), or food restriction (FR) and asked whether insulin action would be equally improved. For 8 days before the in vivo study, Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 24) were either fed ad libitum [control (Con)], treated with Lep or beta3 (CL-316,243) by implanted osmotic mini-pumps, or treated with FR. Total VF was similarly decreased in the latter three groups (Lep, 3.11 +/- 0.96 g; beta3, 2.87 +/- 0.48 g; and FR, 3.54 +/- 0.77 g compared with 6.91 +/- 1.41 g in Con; P  0.001) independent of total fat mass (by (3)H(2)O) and food intake. Insulin (3 mU. kg(-1). min(-1)) clamp studies were performed to assess hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity. Decreased VF resulted in similar and marked improvements in insulin action on glucose production (GP) (Lep, 1.19 +/- 0.51; beta3, 1.46 +/- 0.68; FR, 2.27 +/-0.71 compared with 6.06 +/- 0.70 mg. kg(-1). min(-1) in Con; P  0.001). By contrast, reduction in VF by beta3 and FR failed to reproduce the stimulation of insulin -mediated glucose uptake ( approximately 60%), glycogen synthesis ( approximately 80%), and glycolysis ( approximately 25%) observed with Lep.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Reconstituted high-density lipoprotein ( rHDL ) has been shown to produce a rapid regression of atherosclerosis in animal models and humans. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), which is a bioactive lipid in HDL, plays a role in mitogenesis, endothelial cell motility, and cell survival, as well as organization and differentiation into a vessel. In this study, we examined the direct role of a newly developed rHDL, [POPC(1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine)/S1P/apolipoproteinA-I(A-I)] rHDL containing S1P in tube formation in endothelial cells (ECs) as well as cholesterol efflux in macrophage. The effect of (POPC/S1P/A-I) rHDL on cholesterol efflux in macrophage was similar to that of conventional rHDL, (POPC/A-I) rHDL. In addition, (POPC/S1P/A-I) rHDL induced EC proliferation through the activation of phospho-Akt and phospho-extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (p-ERK) 1/2 and EC tube formation, and this effect was blocked by inhibitors of Akt, ERK and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS). In addition, (POPC/S1P/A-I) rHDL -induced p-ERK1/2 activation and EC tube formation can be mainly attributed to S1P-stimulated signaling through S1P2 and S1P3 as determined by an anti-sense strategy.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The mechanism of hypertension induced by recombinant human erythropoietin ( rHuEPO ) is unclear but may include an increase in peripheral vascular resistance. We studied changes of arterial pressure and plasma endothelin in nine consecutive hemodialysis patients before, and 6 and 12 weeks after, starting rHuEPO. In six patients, changes in cardiac index (CI), stroke index (SI) and total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) were measured by bioimpedance, and forearm vascular responsiveness to intra-arterial norepinephrine (30 to 240 pmol/min) and endothelin-1 (5 pmol/min) were assessed. Six healthy age and sex matched subjects also underwent assessment of forearm vascular responsiveness to norepinephrine and endothelin-1. Treatment with rHuEPO significantly increased hemoglobin and mean arterial pressure (MAP). TPRI also increased by 35 +/- 11%. Plasma endothelin, although elevated basally, remained unchanged. Intra-arterial infusion of norepinephrine caused a maximal increase in forearm vascular resistance (FVR) of 17 +/- 9% before rHuEPO, significantly less than the 32 +/- 5% increase in healthy control subjects (P = 0.04). The response increased to 65 +/- 15% (P = 0.03) after 12 weeks rHuEPO treatment (P = 0.51 vs. controls). Endothelin-1 caused a maximal increase of FVR at 60 minutes of 45 +/- 24% before rHuEPO, which was not significantly different from controls, and tended to decrease with rHuEPO therapy. The response to endothelin-1, but not norepinephrine, correlated inversely with MAP (r = -0.52; P = 0.03) and TPRI (r = -0.51; P = 0.04).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( MMP-2, gelatinase A) and its tissue inhibitor (TIMP-2) are mainly known for their roles in the (patho)physiological remodeling of the vasculature, angiogenesis, tissue repair, tumor invasion, inflammation, and atherosclerotic plaque rupture. A mechanism of action of MMP-2 is the proteolytic breakdown of specific extracellular matrix proteins. The amino acid sequences in interstitial collagen (Gly-Leu/Ile) and laminin-5 (Ala-Leu) that are cleaved by MMP-2 are homologous to a region (Gly(32)-Leu(33)) within human big endothelin-1[1 to 38] (big ET-1 ). Big ET-1 requires cleavage to an active form to produce vasoconstriction. We tested the hypothesis that vascular MMP-2 can cleave big ET-1, thus generating a vasoconstrictor peptide. In perfused rat mesenteric arteries with an intact endothelium, inhibition of vascular MMP-2 with TIMP-2 reduced (by 16.2+/-4.2%) the vasoconstrictor effects of big ET-1 (50 pmol). However, when the endothelium was mechanically removed, TIMP-2 abolished (>90%) the vasoconstriction of big ET-1, and this effect was mimicked by an anti- MMP-2 antibody. Incubation of big ET-1 with recombinant human MMP-2 resulted in the specific cleavage of the Gly(32)-Leu(33) bond of big ET-1. Moreover, the resultant peptide ET-1 [1 to 32] exerted greater vasoconstrictor effects than big ET-1.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

1. Although the systemic and cardiac renin-angiotensin systems are known to be activated in the setting of pressure overload, the actions and signaling mechanisms of angiotensin (Ang) II via AT(1) and AT(2) receptors in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes ( CM ) remain largely unclear. 2. Hypertrophic CM were prepared from rats with aortic banding for 8 weeks, cultured and then treated as follows: (i) 1 micromol/L AngII for 24 h; (ii) 10 micromol/L losartan (an AT(1) receptor antagonist) for 1 h followed by 1 micromol/L AngII for 24 h; and (iii) 10 micromol/L PD123319 (an AT(2) receptor antagonist) for 1 h followed by 1 micromol/L AngII for 24 h. Changes in the expression of genes following stimulation of AT(1) and AT(2) receptors specific to G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways were tested using GEArray (Superarray, Bethesda, MD, USA). The effects of AngII, acting via AT(1) and AT(2) receptors, on the expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6 were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and radioimmunoassay. 3. The genes regulated via stimulation of AT(1) receptors were mainly restricted to the signaling pathways including cAMP/protein kinase (PK) A, Ca(2+), PKC, protein tyrosine kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and nuclear factor-kappaB. In addition to these pathways related to activation of AT(1) receptors, four additional signaling pathways were found to be associated with stimulation of AT(2) receptors, including phospholipase C, nitric oxide/cGMP, Rho and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Glucocorticoids (GCs) block inflammation via interference of the ligand ed glucocorticoid receptor (GR) with the activity of pro-inflammatory transcription factors NF-B and AP-1, a mechanism known as transrepression. This mechanism is believed to involve the activity of GR monomers. Here, we explored how the GR monomer-favoring Compound A (CpdA) affects AP-1 activation and activity. Our results demonstrate that non-steroidal CpdA, unlike classic steroidal GCs, blocks NF-B- but not AP-1-driven gene expression. CpdA rather sustains AP-1-driven gene expression, a result which could mechanistically be explained by the failure of CpdA to block upstream JNK kinase activation and concomitantly also phosphorylation of c-Jun. In concordance and in contrast to DEX, CpdA maintained the expression of the activated AP-1 target gene c-jun, as well as the production of the c-Jun protein. As for the underlying mechanism, GR is a necessary intermediate in the CpdA-mediated gene expression of AP-1-regulated genes, but seems to be superfluous to CpdA-mediated JNK phosphorylation prolongation. The latter phenomenon concurs with the inability of CpdA to stimulate DUSP1 gene expression. ChIP analysis demonstrates that DEX-activated GR, but not CpdA-activated GR, is recruited to AP-1-driven promoters. Furthermore, in mice we observed that CpdA instigates a strong enhancement of TNF-induced AP-1-driven gene expression. Finally, we demonstrate that this phenomenon coincides with an increased sensitivity towards TNF lethality, and implicate again a role for JNK2.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Oxidative stress and cytosolic Ca(2+) overload have important roles on apoptosis in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons after spinal cord injury (SCI).

Rats were divided into four groups as control, HP, SCI, and SCI + HP. The HP groups received 30 mg/kg HP for three concessive days after SCI induction. The SCI-induced TRPM2 and TRPV1 currents and cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration were reduced by HP. The SCI-induced decrease in glutathione peroxidase and cell viability values were ameliorated by HP treatment, and the SCI-induced increase in apoptosis, caspase 3, caspase 9, cytosolic reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and mitochondrial membrane depolarization values in DRG of SCI group were overcome by HP treatment.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The developmental competence of mammalian eggs is compromised by postovulatory aging. We and others have found that in these eggs, the intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) responses required for egg activation and initiation of development are altered. Nevertheless, the mechanism(s) underlying this defective Ca(2+) release is not well known. Here, we investigated if the function of IP (3)R1, the major Ca(2+) release channel at fertilization, was undermined in in vitro-aged mouse eggs. We found that in aged eggs, IP (3)R1 displayed reduced function as many of the changes acquired during maturation that enhance IP (3)R1 Ca(2+) conductivity, such as phosphorylation, receptor reorganization and increased Ca(2+) store content ([Ca(2+)]( ER )), were lost with increasing postovulatory time. IP (3)R1 fragmentation, possibly associated with the activation of caspase-3, was also observed in these eggs. Many of these changes were prevented when the postovulatory aging of eggs was carried out in the presence of caffeine, which minimized the decline in IP (3)R(1) function and maintained [Ca(2+)]( ER ) content. Caffeine also maintained mitochondrial membrane potential, as measured by JC-1 fluorescence.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The hypocretin neurons have been implicated in regulating sleep -wake states as they are lost in patients with the sleep disorder narcolepsy. Hypocretin (HCRT) neurons are located only in the perifornical region of the posterior hypothalamus and heavily innervate pontine brainstem neurons, such as the locus coeruleus (LC), which have traditionally been implicated in promoting arousal. It is not known how the hypocretin innervation of the pons regulates sleep -wake states as pontine lesions have never been shown to increase sleep. It is likely that in previous studies specific neurons were not lesioned. Therefore, in this study, we applied saporin-based neurotoxins to the dorsolateral pons and monitored sleep in rats. Anti-dopamine-beta-hydroxylase-saporin killed the LC neurons but sleep was affected only during a two hour light-dark transition period. Application of hypocretin2-saporin killed fewer LC neurons relative to other adjacent neurons. This occurred because the LC neurons possess the hypocretin receptor 1 but the ligand hypocretin 2 binds to this receptor with less affinity relative to the hypocretin receptor 2. The hypocretin2-saporin lesioned rats compared to controls had increased sleep during the dark period and displayed increased limb movements during REM sleep.

TNF and IL-1 are two proinflammatory cytokines that play critical roles in many diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and infectious diseases. How TNF- and IL-1-mediated signaling is finely tuned is not fully elucidated. Here, we identify tripartite-motif protein 38 ( TRIM38 ) as a critical negative regulator of TNF- and IL-1-triggered signaling. Overexpression of TRIM38 inhibited activation of NF-B and induction of downstream cytokines following TNF and IL-1 stimulation, whereas knockdown or knockout of TRIM38 had the opposite effects. TRIM38 constitutively interacted with critical components TGF--activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-binding protein 2/3 ( TAB2/3 ) and promoted lysosome-dependent degradation of TAB2/3 independent of its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Consistently, deficiency of TRIM38 resulted in abolished translocation of TAB2 to the lysosome, increased level of TAB2 in cells, and enhanced activation of TAK1 after TNF and IL-1 stimulation.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The effect of EGF on (14)C-alpha-methyl-D-glucopyranoside ( alpha-MG ) uptake and its related signaling pathways were examined in primary cultured rabbit renal proximal tubule cells (PTCs). Epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) (50 ng/ml) was found to inhibit alpha-MG uptake, a distinctive proximal tubule marker. The EGF effect was blocked by AG1478 (an EGF receptor antagonist) or genistein and herbimycin (tyrosine kinase inhibitors), respectively. In addition, the EGF -induced inhibition of alpha-MG uptake was blocked by neomycin and U73122 (phospholipase C inhibitors) as well as staurosporine, H-7, and bisindolylmaleimide I (protein kinase C inhibitors). EGF was also observed to increase inositol phosphate formation. Furthermore, both the EGF -induced inhibition of alpha-MG uptake and increase of arachidonic acid (AA) release were blocked by AACOCF(3) (a cytosolic phospholipase A(2) inhibitor), indomethacin (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor), and econazole (a cytochrome P-450 epoxygenase inhibitor). We examined the involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in mediating the effect of EGF on alpha-MG uptake. Indeed, EGF increased phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAPK and the EGF -induced inhibition of alpha-MG uptake as well as the stimulatory effect of EGF on AA release was blocked by PD 98059 (a p44/42 MAPK inhibitor), suggesting a causal relationship.

The VX2 carcinoma-bearing rabbit is an animal model for tumor -induced hypercalcemia, thought to be due to increased bone destruction effected by prostaglandin E2. The present experiments suggest that the pathophysiology of the hypercalcemia differs from that previously proposed. Tumor was transplanted intramuscularly into 2.5- to 3-kg male New Zealand White rabbits, which were conditioned to a 1.5% calcium diet and treated with daily subcutaneous injections of dichloromethane diphosphonate (10 mg. kg-1. day-1), a potent inhibitor of bone resorption, or 0.9% NaCl (2 ml. kg-1. day -1). The diphosphonate had no significant effect on plasma Ca2+ in either group. After day 31, half the animals of each group were fed a calcium-free diet. This normalized the plasma Ca2+ in each VX2-bearing rabbit within 3 to 4 days but had little effect in control rabbits. In a second series of experiments, VX2-bearing rabbits maintained on standard rabbit chow were treated for 11 days with parenteral indomethacin (30--60 mg/day) or 0.9% NaCl. Although indomethacin normalized the markedly elevated urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2, both treatment groups became severely hypercalcemic. Dietary calcium restriction promptly restored to normal the plasma Ca2+ concentration. In a third series of experiments, rabbits were fed standard rabbit chow and treated with oral indomethacin (40 mg/day) while control-rabbits were pair fed in identical chow. Transplantation of VX2 tumor into both groups caused hypercalcemia.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Recent studies have demonstrated that antagonism of somatodendritic serotonin1A ( 5-HT 1A) autoreceptors can potentiate the increase of extracellular 5-HT concentrations induced by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors including fluoxetine. The present study was conducted to uncover any functional difference between the 5-HT 1A autoreceptors located on the cell bodies of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal (DRN) and median (MRN) raphe nuclei. The investigational approach used in the present study was to detect extracellular 5-HT concentrations in two terminal areas, prefrontal cortex (Pfc) and dorsal hippocampus (Dhp), which are mainly innervated by the 5-HT neurons located in the DRN and MRN respectively. To avoid possible variation between individual animals a dual-probe microdialysis procedure was applied to determine 5-HT concentrations in both brain areas of the same rat. Fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, s.c.) alone produced a smaller increase in the extracellular 5-HT concentration in the Pfc than Dhp of the same rat (maximal 5-HT concentrations were 183% and 223% of the baseline values in Pfc and Dhp respectively). However, an antagonist of 5-HT 1A receptors, WAY100635, subsequently injected (s.c.) at 1 mg/kg brought the 5-HT concentrations to similar levels in the Pfc (332%) and Dhp (308%). Since the 5-HT concentrations immediately before the injection of WAY100635 were lower in the Pfc (102%) than Dhp (186%), WAY100635 induced a larger 5-HT net increase in the Pfc (332%-102%=230%) than Dhp (308%-186%=122%). On the other hand, WAY100635 alone did not significantly change the extracellular 5-HT concentrations in both areas.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Pediatric renal allograft recipients receive a relatively greater increase in renal mass than do adult recipients because the donors are usually adults. They also have a higher frequency of posttransplant hypertension and cardiovascular problems. Avoiding other variables common to both pediatric and adult patients including pre-existing hypertension and renal disease and the use of corticosteroids, renal mass was increased by up to 50% in immature dogs by implanting large kidneys from adult dogs. Cardiovascular and renal function were studied before and after transplantation. Blood pressure was decreased in anesthetized mongrel pups at 2 hr and 3 days after surgery by 22 and 6 mm Hg, respectively; pressure was similarly reduced in conscious, chronically catheterized DLA-matched beagle pups maintained for 14 days, from 96.1 +/- 3.0 to 76.8 +/- 6.7 mm Hg (P less than 0.001). Glomerular filtration rate was decreased at 2 hr and 3 days, but was normal at 14 days. Cardiac output was reduced in four of five recipients at 2 hr but was unchanged at 3 days.

We have recently shown that expression of the GLUT1 glucose transporter isoform is augmented in cells exposed to cobalt chloride [ Co(II) ], an agent that stimulates the expression of hypoxia-responsive genes (Behrooz, A., Ismail-Beigi, F., 1997. J. Biol. Chem. 272, 5555-5562.). Here, we examine the effect of Co(II) on glycemia and tissue GLUT1 mRNA content of normal and diabetic rats. The addition of 2 mM Co(II) in the drinking water reduced the glycemia of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats by day 3 from 32.3 +/- 2.1 to 21.0 +/- 1.9 mM (non-fasting). Co(II) resulted in no change in serum insulin levels of normal or diabetic rats. Treatment with 4 mM Co(II) was more effective than 2 mM Co(II) in reducing the glycemia of diabetic rats, while 6 mM Co(II) was associated with severe toxicity. GLUT1 mRNA content increased significantly in ventricular myocardium, renal cortex, skeletal muscle, cerebrum and liver of normal and diabetic rats treated with 2 mM cobalt chloride (ranging from 1.3- to 2.9-fold in the different tissues).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that programmed cell death-1 ( PD-1 ) siRNA can downregulate PD-1 expression in macrophages in culture and in tumor tissues in mice and inhibit tumor growth in a mouse model. PD-1 siRNA was encapsulated in solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and the physical properties of the resultant SLNs were characterized. The ability of the PD-1 siRNA-SLNs to downregulate PD-1 expression was confirmed in J774A.1 macrophages in culture and in tumor tissues in mice. Moreover, the antitumor activity of the PD-1 siRNA-SLNs was evaluated in a mouse model. The PD-1 siRNA-SLNs were roughly spherical, and their particle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential were 141  5 nm, 0.17  0.02, and 20.7  4.7 mV, respectively, with an siRNA entrapment efficiency of 98.9%. The burst release of the PD-1 siRNA from the SLNs was minimal. The PD-1 siRNA-SLNs downregulated PD-1 expression on J774A.1 macrophage cell surface as well as in macrophages in B16-F10 tumor s pre-established in mice.

Macrophages are a major component of the innate immune response, comprising the first line of defense against various intracellular pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In this report, we studied the factors that regulate growth of M. tuberculosis H37Rv in subpopulations of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). In healthy donors, M. tuberculosis H37Rv grew 5.6-fold more rapidly in CD14(hi) MDMs compared with that in CD14(lo)CD16(+) MDMs. Compared with CD14(lo)CD16(+) cells, M. tuberculosis H37Rv-stimulated CD14(hi) monocytes produced more IL-10 and had increased mRNA expression for c-Maf, a transcription factor that upregulates IL-10 gene expression. c-Maf small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited IL-10 production and growth of M. tuberculosis in CD14(hi) cells. Compared with CD14(lo)CD16(+) monocytes, M. tuberculosis H37Rv-stimulated CD14(hi) cells had increased expression of 22 genes whose promoters contained a c-Maf binding site, including hyaluronan synthase 1 (HAS1). c-Maf siRNA inhibited HAS1 expression in M. tuberculosis-stimulated CD14(hi) monocytes, and HAS1 siRNA inhibited growth of M. tuberculosis in CD14(hi) MDMs. M. tuberculosis H37Rv upregulated expression of HAS1 protein and its product, hyaluronan, in CD14(hi) MDMs.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder, related to the loss of dopamine (DA)-containing neurons in the substantia nigra. In experimental animals, both vertebrates and invertebrates, rotenone, a commercially available organic pesticide, induces symptoms of Parkinson's disease. We found that that rotenone is toxic to the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis (4-day LC50 0.8 microM). Rotenone, at concentrations from 0.1 to 5 microM, caused progressive and irreversible behavioural deficits in both acute and chronic exposure. Chronic exposure to 0.5 microM rotenone led to a progressive decrease in spontaneous locomotion and in feeding, reaching almost 100% inhibition of both behaviours by the 7th day of rotenone treatment. In the central nervous system preparation made on the 7th day of treatment the postsynaptic potentials evoked by the identified dopaminergic RPeD1 neuron disappeared whereas the synaptic inputs received by the RPeD1 from a peptidergic neuron (VD4) were still functional. Immunostaining revealed that the tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity decreased below the detectable level in both the RPeD1 cell body and its axonal processes. Finally, HPLC assay showed a significant (25%) decrease in DA level in the CNS by the 7th day of rotenone treatment.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignancy that harbors a dismal prognosis in advanced stages. Mitotane is approved as an orphan drug for treatment of ACC and counteracts tumor growth and steroid hormone production. Despite serious adverse effects, mitotane has been clinically used for decades. Elucidation of its unknown molecular mechanism of action seems essential to develop better ACC therapies. Here, we set out to identify the molecular target of mitotane and altered downstream mechanisms by combining expression genomics and mass spectrometry technology in the NCI-H295 ACC model cell line. Pathway analyses of expression genomics data demonstrated activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and profound alteration of lipid-related genes caused by mitotane treatment. ER stress marker CHOP was strongly induced and the two upstream ER stress signalling events XBP1-mRNA splicing and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 A (eIF2) phosphorylation were activated by mitotane in NCI-H295 cells but to a much lesser extent in four nonsteroidogenic cell lines. Lipid mass spectrometry revealed mitotane -induced increase of free cholesterol, oxysterols, and fatty acids specifically in NCI-H295 cells as cause of ER stress. We demonstrate that mitotane is an inhibitor of sterol-O-acyl-transferase 1 (SOAT1) leading to accumulation of these toxic lipids. In ACC tissue samples we show variable SOAT1 expression correlating with the response to mitotane treatment.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is used in the treatment of cholestatic liver diseases, but its mechanism of action is not yet well defined. The aim of this study was to explore the protective mechanisms of the taurine-conjugate of UDCA (tauroursodeoxycholic acid [TUDCA]) against glycochenodeoxycholic acid ( GCDCA )-induced apoptosis in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were exposed to GCDCA, TUDCA, the glyco-conjugate of UDCA (GUDCA), and TCDCA. The phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase pathway (PI3K) and nuclear factor-kappaB were inhibited using LY 294002 and adenoviral overexpression of dominant-negative IkappaB, respectively. The role of p38 and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways were investigated using the inhibitors SB 203580 and U0 126 and Western blot analysis. Transcription was blocked by actinomycin-D. Apoptosis was determined by measuring caspase-3, -9, and -8 activity using fluorimetric enzyme detection, Western blot analysis, immunocytochemistry, and nuclear morphological analysis. Our results demonstrated that uptake of GCDCA is needed for apoptosis induction. TUDCA, but not TCDCA and GUDCA, rapidly inhibited, but did not delay, apoptosis at all time points tested. However, the protective effect of TUDCA was independent of its inhibition of caspase-8. Up to 6 hours of preincubation with TUDCA before addition of GCDCA clearly decreased GCDCA -induced apoptosis. At up to 1.5 hours after exposure with GCDCA, the addition of TUDCA was still protective.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Angiotensin II (Ang II) plays a pivotal role in cardiovascular remodeling leading to hypertension, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Pitavastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inihibitor, is known to have pleiotropic actions against the development of cardiovascular remodeling. The objectives of this study were to clarify the beneficial effects as well as the mechanism of action of pitavastatin against Ang II-induced organ damage. C57BL6/J mice at 10 weeks of age were infused with Ang II for 2 weeks and were simultaneously administered pitavastatin or a vehicle. Pitavastatin treatment improved Ang II-induced left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction and attenuated enhancement of cardiac fibrosis, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, coronary perivascular fibrosis, and medial thickening. Ang II-induced oxidative stress, cardiac TGFbeta-1 expression, and Smad 2/3 phosphorylation were all attenuated by pitavastatin treatment. Pitavastatin also reduced Ang II-induced cardiac remodeling and diastolic dysfunction in eNOS -/- mice as in wild-type mice. In eNOS -/- mice, the Ang II-induced cardiac oxidative stress and TGF-beta-Smad 2/3 signaling pathway were enhanced, and pitavastatin treatment attenuated the enhanced oxidative stress and the signaling pathway. Moreover, pitavastatin treatment reduced the high mortality rate and improved renal insufficiency in Ang II-treated eNOS -/- mice, with suppression of glomerular oxidative stress and TGF-beta-Smad 2/3 signaling pathway.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Studies were performed to determine the effects of intracerebroventricular norepinephrine (NE) or neuropeptide Y ( NPY ) on the ovine hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis. NE (50 micrograms) increased mean hypophysial-portal corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels (1 h, 1.3- and 2.9-fold; 4 h, 2.2- and 5.7-fold) and caused acute and sustained increases in mean plasma ACTH and cortisol. NPY (50 microgram) also increased mean CRF and AVP levels (1 h, 1.4- and 4.2-fold; 4 h, 1.1- and 1.9-fold), increased pituitary-adrenal activity at 1 h, and caused ACTH hypersecretion at 4 h. When added to cultured ovine anterior pituitary cells, NPY neither increased basal ACTH release nor augmented CRF- or AVP-induced ACTH release.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
We conclude that: (a) activation of either the central noradrenergic or <el> NPY <le> pathways causes an acute and sustained stimulation of the ovine <re> HPA <er> axis; (b) such activation increases the AVP/CRF ratio, suggesting a dominant role for AVP in the ovine stress response; and (c) the central noradrenergic or <el> NPY <le> systems may cause sustained <re> HPA <er> activation by attenuating or disrupting the glucocorticoid negative feedback on those brain areas concerned with regulation of the <re> HPA <er> axis. positive----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

High-molecular-weight kininogen (HK) and its domain 3 (D3) exhibit anticoagulant properties and inhibit platelet activation at low thrombin concentration in vitro. We hypothesized that the rapid occlusive thrombosis in HK-deficient (HKd) rats following endothelial injury of the aorta results from enhanced platelet aggregation by thrombin. The effects of D3 (G235-M357) or D3-derived peptides on thrombosis in vivo were tested. D3 and its exon 7C terminal peptide (E7CP, K270-Q292), expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins (GST-D3, GST-E7CP), or GST alone, as well as cleaved HK (HKa) or synthetic peptide E7CP, were infused intravenously 10 min before endothelial injury. Blood flow was reduced down to 10% of baseline flow within 28 +/- 5.2 min by a platelet-fibrin thrombus in GST-treated HKd rats compared with >240 min in GST-treated normal HK rats (wild type). GST-D3, GST-E7CP, HKa, or E7CP infusion prolonged the flow time to 233, >240, 223, and >240 min, respectively, in HKd rats. When GST-E7CP was infused 10 min after the injury, blood flow was maintained for >240 min.

Fluid shear stress ( FSS ) is a critical regulator of cation transport in the collecting duct (CD). High-dietary sodium (Na) consumption increases urine flow, Na excretion, and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) excretion. We hypothesize that increases in FSS elicited by increasing tubular flow rate induce the release of PGE(2) from renal epithelial cells into the extracellular compartment and regulate ion transport. Media retrieved from CD cells exposed to physiologic levels of FSS reveal several fold higher concentration of PGE(2) compared with static controls. Treatment of CD cells with either cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) or COX-2 inhibitors during exposure to FSS limited the increase in PGE(2) concentration to an equal extent, suggesting COX-1 and COX-2 contribute equally to FSS -induced PGE(2) release. Cytosolic phospholipase A2 ( cPLA2 ), the principal enzyme that generates the COX substrate arachidonic acid, is regulated by mitogen-activated protein-kinase-dependent phosphorylation and intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)), both signaling processes, of which, are activated by FSS. Inhibition of the ERK and p38 pathways reduced PGE(2) release by 53.3  8.4 and 32.6  11.3%, respectively, while antagonizing the JNK pathway had no effect. In addition, chelation of [Ca(2+)](i) limited the FSS -mediated increase in PGE(2) concentration by 47.5  7.5% of that observed in untreated sheared cells.

1. The nitric oxide synthase ( NO S) inhibitor, N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), inhibits both rat and human eosinophil chemotaxis in vitro. Here, the role of nitric oxide ( NO ) in human eosinophil cell surface integrin expression and function was investigated. 2. Human peripheral blood eosinophils were treated with L-NAME (0.01 - 1.0 mM) and their adhesion to human fibronectin and serum observed. Adhesion of cells to fibronectin and serum increased by 24.0+/-4.6 and 43.8+/-4.7%, respectively, when eosinophils were treated with 1.0 mM L-NAME. Increased adhesion by L-NAME could be abolished when cells were co-incubated with VLA-4- and Mac-1-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). 3. The NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (2.5 mM), significantly inhibited eosinophil adhesion to fibronectin and serum by 34.3+/-4.5 and 45.2+/-5.6%, respectively. This inhibition was accompanied by a 4 fold increase in the levels of intracellular cyclic GMP. 4. Flow cytometrical analysis demonstrated that L-NAME induced an increased expression of CD11b (Mac-1) on the eosinophil cell surface of 36.3+/-7.4%.

The neurotransmitters involved in the inhibition of luteinizing hormone ( LH ) release induced by electrochemical stimulation (anodic d.c., 100 microA/30 s) of the medial raphe nucleus ( MRn ) were studied. Stimulation applied at noon on the day of proestrus blocked the preovulatory surge of LH and ovulation. This effect was prevented by pretreating the animals (15 min before stimulation) with the 5-HT antagonist, methysergide (3.5 mg/kg, i.p.). The inhibition of LH release induced by stimulation of the MRn was also suppressed by the injection of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonists, picrotoxin (0.8 mg/kg, i.p.) and bicuculline (6 mg/kg, i.p.). Injection of 5-HT (15 micrograms) into the third ventricle on the day of proestrus mimicked the effect of MRn stimulation, a response which was prevented by methysergide, picrotoxin or bicuculline.

The effect of inulin on isoflavone absorption and the effect of isoflavones and synergy with inulin on calcium absorption in rats was investigated. Rats (n = 48) were divided into three groups and fed inulin (50 mg/g), isoflavone (8 mg/g) or inulin + isoflavone (50 mg/g + 8 mg/g) diets for 21 days. After a 2-h fast, rats were given (45)Ca orally or intraperitoneally, together with 25 mg of calcium as calcium acetate. Blood and femurs were collected 4 days later. Sera were analyzed for isoflavones using HPLC-MS, femurs for (45)Ca by beta-scintillation counting, and total femoral calcium by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Both groups fed isoflavones had similar and significantly higher weight-adjusted total femoral calcium content compared to the inulin -fed group (p  0.0001). (45)Ca absorption was significantly higher (p  0.01) when isoflavones were added to the diet, and serum equol was significantly lower (p  0.01) when inulin was added to the diet containing isoflavones.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ( FGFR2 ) was demonstrated to correlate to the progression and prognosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) by numerous evidences. However, as a well-recognized suppressor of FGFR2 signalling, the clinical significance of Sprouty (SPRY) family of ICC has not been investigated. In our study, the expressions of SPRY1-4 in 20 pairs of fresh tumour tissues were detected with qPCR, and in 108 cases of paraffin-embedded tissues with immunohistochemistry. The prognostic value of SPRY family in ICC was estimated with univariate analysis and multivariate analysis. As a result, SPRY2 was identified as an independent prognostic biomarker predicting favourable prognosis of ICC. High SPRY2 expression was correlated with good differentiation of ICC. With silencing SPRY2 expression, we demonstrated that SPRY2 could suppress FGFR2 -induced ERK phosphorylation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) under FGF1 stimulation. By overexpressing SPRY2-wide type or SPRY2-Y55F, the tyrosine-55 of SPRY2 was demonstrated to be essential in suppressing ERK phosphorylation, tumour invasion and EMT of ICC cells.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Escherichia coli endotoxin ( LPS ) can induce the clinical syndrome of septic shock and renal cortical necrosis and can stimulate nitric oxide ( NO ) production from macrophages, vascular smooth muscle, and glomerular mesangial cells in vitro. NO is an endogenous vasodilator, which also inhibits platelet aggregation and adhesion. We therefore sought to determine whether LPS would stimulate NO production in vivo and, if so, whether this NO would modulate endotoxin-induced glomerular thrombosis. The stable NO end-products, NO 2 and NO 3, were measured in serum and urine collections from rats during baseline and after injection of LPS, with or without substances that modulate NO synthesis. The urinary excretion of NO 2/ NO 3 was 1,964 +/- 311 nm/8 h during the baseline and increased to 6,833 +/- 776 nm/8 h after a single intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 mg/kg LPS (P  0.05). The serum concentration of NO 2/ NO 3 also significantly increased after LPS injection. Both the urine and serum stimulation was significantly prevented by the NO synthesis inhibitor, Nw-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). L-Arginine, given with LPS +L-NAME significantly restored the NO 2/ NO 3 levels in the urine. Ex vivo incubation of tissues from rats treated with LPS demonstrated NO production by the aorta, whole kidney, and glomeruli, but not cortical tubules. Histological examination of kidneys from rats given either LPS or L-NAME alone revealed that 2 and 4.5% of the glomeruli contained capillary thrombosis, respectively.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

To elucidate the physiological role of the AMP -adenosine metabolic cycle and to investigate the relation between AMP and adenosine formation, the O2 supply of isolated guinea pig hearts was varied (95% to 10% O2). The net adenosine formation rate ( AMP -->adenosine) and coronary venous effluent adenosine release rate were measured; free cytosolic AMP was determined by 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance. Switching from 95% to 40% O2 increased free AMP and adenosine formation 4-fold, whereas free cytosolic adenosine and venous adenosine release rose 15- to 20-fold. In the AMP range from 200 to 3000 nmol/L, there was a linear correlation between free AMP and adenosine formation (R2 =.71); however, adenosine release increased several-fold more than formation. At 95% O2, only 6% of the adenosine formed was released; however, this fraction increased to 22% at 40% O2, demonstrating reduced adenosine salvage. Selective blockade of adenosine deaminase and adenosine kinase indicated that flux through adenosine kinase decreased from 85% to 35% of adenosine formation in hypoxia. Mathematical model analysis indicated that this apparent decrease in enzyme activity was not due to saturation but to the inhibition of adenosine kinase activity to 6% of the basal levels. The data show (1) that adenosine formation is proportional to the AMP substrate concentration and (2) that hypoxia decreases adenosine kinase activity, thereby shunting myocardial adenosine from the salvage pathway to venous release.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Plasma phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) is thought to be involved in the remodeling of high density lipoproteins ( HDL ), which are atheroprotective. It is also involved in the metabolism of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). Hence, PLTP is thought to be an important factor in lipoprotein metabolism and the development of atherosclerosis. We have overexpressed PLTP in mice heterozygous for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, a model for atherosclerosis. We show that increased PLTP activity results in a dose-dependent decrease in HDL, and a moderate stimulation of VLDL secretion (/=1.5-fold). The mice were given a high fat, high cholesterol diet, which resulted in hypercholesterolemia in all animals. HDL concentrations were dramatically reduced in PLTP-overexpressing animals when compared with LDL receptor controls, whereas VLDL + LDL cholesterol levels were identical. Susceptibility to atherosclerosis was increased in a PLTP dose-responsive manner.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Following a traumatic brain injury (TBI), the excessive release of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is a major cause of cerebral edema, which, in turn, can cause permanent neuronal loss and cognitive deficits in laboratory rats. This study examined the changes in expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha after progesterone (8 mg/kg) or allopregnanolone (4 mg/kg) treatment in brain-injured rats at 3, 8, and 12 h and 6 days post-injury. Adult male rats received either bilateral prefrontal cortical contusion or sham surgery. The hormones were given intraperitoneally at 1 and 6 h, and continued once per day for up to 5 days. The gene expression of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha was measured by mRNA using real-time quantitative reverse transcripted polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The protein concentrations of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to confirm the translation from mRNA to protein. The results indicated that progesterone and allopregnanolone reduce both IL-1beta and TNF-alpha at 3 h post-injury, when the expression of these cytokines peaks. At 8 and 12 h post-injury, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha gene expression in injured rats was still elevated compared to shams. By the sixth day post-injury, cytokine expression was back to the level of intact rats.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Prolonged intrathecal (i.t.) administration of morphine results in tolerance to morphine -induced antinociception. We found that co-administration of selective metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 antagonist MPEP with morphine could suppress the loss of morphine -induced antinociception and inhibit the development of tolerance to morphine -induced antinociceptive effect. Whereas, the specific metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 agonist CHPG does the opposite. As the activation of NMDA receptor after chronic morphine administration has been verified, we suppose there is an enhanced activation of mGluR5 during the development of tolerance to morphine -induced antinociception. Activation of mGluR5 may mobilize the release of intracellular Ca(2+) and activate PKC, leading to morphine -induced antinociception suppression.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Chronic pain after spinal cord injury represents a therapeutic challenge. Progesterone, a neuroprotective steroid, has been shown to modulate nociceptive thresholds, whereas its effect on neuropathic pain needs to be further explored. In this study, we evaluated whether progesterone could ameliorate pain-associated behaviors in animals subjected to a spinal cord hemisection. The development of mechanical and cold allodynia was assessed in injured male rats treated with daily injections of progesterone or vehicle. The expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits, protein kinase C gamma (PKC), preprodynorphin (ppD), and kappa opioid receptor (KOR), key players in chronic pain mechanisms, was determined in the dorsal spinal cord. Twenty-eight days after injury, all vehicle-treated animals presented allodynic behaviors and a marked increase in NMDAR subunits, PKC, and ppD mRNA levels, with no changes in KOR mRNA levels. Progesterone prevented the development of mechanical allodynia and reduced the painful responses to cold stimulation. In correlation with the attenuation of pain behaviors, the steroid prevented NMDAR subunits and PKC mRNAs upregulation, did not modify the elevated ppD mRNA levels, but increased KOR expression.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and migration are substantially controlled by the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta ( PDGFRbeta ), which can be regulated by the Ser/Thr kinase G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 (GRK2). In mouse aortic SMCs, however, we found that prolonged PDGFRbeta activation engendered down-regulation of GRK5, but not GRK2; moreover, GRK5 and PDGFRbeta were coordinately up-regulated in SMCs from atherosclerotic arteries. With SMCs from GRK5 knock-out and cognate wild type mice (five of each), we found that physiologic expression of GRK5 increased PDGF-promoted PDGFRbeta seryl phosphorylation by 3-fold and reduced PDGFRbeta -promoted phosphoinositide hydrolysis, thymidine incorporation, and overall PDGFRbeta tyrosyl phosphorylation by approximately 35%. Physiologic SMC GRK5 activity also increased PDGFRbeta association with the phosphatase Shp2 (8-fold), enhanced phosphorylation of PDGFRbeta Tyr(1009) (the docking site for Shp2), and reduced phosphorylation of PDGFRbeta Tyr(1021). Consistent with having increased PDGFRbeta -associated Shp2 activity, GRK5-expressing SMCs demonstrated greater PDGF-induced Src activation than GRK5-null cells. GRK5-mediated desensitization of PDGFRbeta inositol phosphate signaling was diminished by Shp2 knock-down or impairment of PDGFRbeta /Shp2 association. In contrast to GRK5, physiologic GRK2 activity did not alter PDGFRbeta /Shp2 association.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Ethanol, one of the most widely used drugs in Western society, worsens obstructive sleep apnea in humans. No studies, however, have distinguished between two primary mechanisms that could mediate suppression of genioglossus (GG) activity with ethanol. We test the hypothesis that ethanol suppresses GG activity by effects at the hypoglossal motor pool and/or by state-dependent regulation of motor activity via independent influences on sleep /arousal processes. Intraperitoneal injections of ethanol (1.25 g/kg, n = 6 rats) resulted in maximum blood levels of 125.5 +/- 15.8 mg/dl, i.e., physiologically relevant levels for producing behavioral impairment in rats and humans. Ethanol decreased wakefulness, reduced sleep latency, and increased non-rapid eye movement sleep (P  0.001, n = 10 rats) and significantly reduced postural muscle tone and electroencephalogram frequencies, consistent with sedation. Ethanol also caused a state-dependent (wakefulness only) decrease in respiratory-related GG activity (P = 0.018) but did not affect diaphragm amplitude or rate, with the magnitude of GG decrease related to baseline activity (P  0.0002).

Evidence suggests that, in addition to its diuretic property, furosemide also may exert direct vascular effects. Because thromboxane A2 (TXA2) has a role in the control of vascular tone, we investigated the effect of furosemide on the contraction induced by U46619 (a stable TXA2 mimetic) on isolated human internal mammary artery (IMA) and saphenous vein (SV). Concentration-response curves to U46619 were performed in the absence (vehicle) or the presence of furosemide (0.1-1 mM) on rings of IMA and SV. In addition, the relaxant effect of furosemide (0.1 microM-1 mM) also was evaluated on U46619 -precontracted IMA and SV. The participation of cyclooxygenase derivatives was studied by pretreatment with indomethacin. Furosemide (0.1-1.0 mM) caused parallel rightward shifts of U46619 concentration-response curves without affecting the maximal responses in both IMA and SV. Treatment with indomethacin (1 microM) modified neither the inhibitory effect of furosemide on U46619 -induced contractions, nor the relaxant effect of furosemide on U46619 -induced contractions, nor the relaxant effect of furosemide on U46619 -precontracted IMA and SV.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The poly(vinylidene-trifluoroethylene)/barium titanate (PVDF) membrane enhances in vitro osteoblast differentiation and in vivo bone repair. Here, we hypothesized that this higher bone repair could be also due to bone resorption inhibition mediated by a microRNA (miR)/ RANKL circuit. To test our hypothesis, the large-scale miR expression of bone tissue grown on PVDF and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membranes was evaluated to identify potential RANKL -targeted miRs modulated by PVDF. The animal model used was rat calvarial defects implanted with either PVDF or PTFE. At 4 and 8 weeks, the bone tissue grown on membranes was submitted to a large-scale analysis of miRs by microarray. The expression of miR-34a and some of its targets, including RANKL, were evaluated by real-time polimerase chain reaction and osteoclast activity was detected by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. Among more than 250 miRs, twelve, including miR-34a, were simultaneously higher expressed (2 fold) at 4 and 8 weeks on PVDF. The higher expression of miR-34a was concomitant with a reduced expression of all its evaluated targets, including RANKL. Additionally, more TRAP-positive cells were observed in bone tissue grown on PTFE compared with PVDF in both time points.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We have designed studies to measure the effects of PTH on collagen synthesis in vivo in humans, utilizing measurements of the serum levels of procollagen extension peptides during and after infusion of synthetic human PTH (hPTH) fragment (1-34). Radioimmunoassays for the carboxy-terminal peptide of type I procollagen (pColl-C) and the amino-terminal peptide of type III procollagen (pColl-III-N) were used to measure acute changes in serum during and after hPTH(1-34). In all six osteoporotic subjects and two normal individuals, serum levels of pColl-I-C were decreased by 16 hr of infusion and returned towards normal 14 hr after the infusion was discontinued; serum levels of pColl-III-N did not change significantly during the infusion, but were increased at 14 hr after the infusion was discontinued. The PTH -induced decrease in levels of pColl-I-C correlated with an increase in blood levels of ionized calcium.

We recently identified a 32 K mol wt insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein (BP) which is markedly increased in the serum of streptozotocin-diabetic rats and recognized by antiserum against the human amniotic fluid IGFBP (hIGFBP-1). In the present study we sought to confirm that this protein represents the rat homolog of IGFBP -1 (rIGFBP-1), and that rIGFBP-1 may, therefore, play an important role in the regulation of IGF bioactivity in experimental diabetes. Since the abundance of related hepatic mRNA is high in diabetic rats, we asked whether well differentiated H4EIIC3 rat hepatoma cells produce rIGFBP-1 and provide sufficient amounts of this protein for purification and further characterization. Specific IGF-binding activity in hepatoma conditioned medium was detected initially by incubation with 125I-labeled recombinant human IGF-II and precipitation with polyethylene glycol. Ligand blotting demonstrated a 32 K BP, identical in size to the major low mol wt IGFBP found in diabetic rat serum. Affinity labeling and immunoprecipitation confirmed that this BP is related to human IGFBP -1 and is distinct from the fetal rat IGFBP, rIGFBP-2. Incorporation of [35S]methionine into 32 K BPs confirmed synthesis by hepatoma cells. For purification of BPs, conditioned medium was collected in roller culture, and BPs were purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, Sephadex G-75 chromatography, and reverse phase HPLC.

T cells oxidized with sodium periodate proliferate polyclonally in response to accessory cells. We confirmed previous work showing that DC are potent stimulators of this response. In addition, the accessory function of unfractionated mouse spleen and spleen adherent cells was markedly reduced after elimination of DC with a specific monoclonal antibody and complement. Therefore oxidative mitogenesis was used as a model to study the mechanism by which DC stimulate T cell proliferative responses. A two-stage mechanism was identified. The first stage occurred during the first 20 h of culture, required live DC, and involved the progressive release of interleukin 2 (IL-2) into the medium and acquisition of responsiveness to this growth factor. The second stage occurred between 20 and 40 h, did not require live DC, and involved DNA synthesis in response to IL-2. Similar events occurred during culture of DC with unmodified T cells (syngeneic MLR) but were quantitatively reduced. The experimental approach was to co-culture DC and T cells for up to 20 h and then kill the DC with specific antibody, or anti-Ia antibody, and complement. Subsequent proliferation was inhibited if the T cells were cultured in fresh medium. However, proliferation was restored when the lymphocytes were cultured in the original DC -T cell medium, or with a crude or a purified preparation of IL-2. IL-2 did not induce the proliferation of T cells that had been cultured in the absence of DC, and did not synergize with viable DC.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of ovariectomy and growth hormone on mammary epithelial cell proliferation and estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) expression within the bovine mammary gland. Two experiments were performed. In the first experiment, eight Holstein heifer calves aged between 1 and 3 mo were ovariectomized, while six calves served as controls. At 6 mo of age, calves were treated with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to label proliferating cells and sacrificed 2 h later. Coinciding with reduced mammary mass (304 +/- 25 vs. 130 +/- 21 g), proliferation of mammary epithelial cells was significantly lower in ovariectomized heifers compared to control heifers (2.24 vs. 0.25%). ER alpha expression was restricted to mammary epithelial cells and was not observed within intra-lobular stroma of parenchymal tissue. The proportion of ER alpha positive cells was significantly higher in ovariectomized heifers than in controls (36.1% +/- 2.2 vs. 46.7% +/- 2.4). In the second experiment, mammary biopsies were taken from five 6-mo-old heifers, immediately preceding and 7 d following a single injection of bovine growth hormone. Mammary epithelial cell proliferation (assessed by incorporation of 3H-thymidine) was increased by growth hormone. The proportion of ER alpha positive mammary epithelial cells was not increased by growth hormone.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The efficacy of lamotrigine and felbamate against maximal electroshock (MES)-induced seizures was assessed under conditions mimicking the pharmacoresistance associated with an increased excitatory neurotransmission. N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ), but not kainate applied at subconvulsive dose, reduced the activity of lamotrigine against MES-induced seizures increasing its ED50 value from 4.3 (3.2-5.6) to 6.1 (5.2-7.2) mg/kg (p  0.001). This effect was reversed by co-application of an NMDA receptor antagonist D-(E)-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid (CGP 40116) at 0.1 mg/kg [4.5 (3.7-5.6) vs. 6.1 (5.2-7.2) mg/kg; p  0.001]. The anticonvulsive action of felbamate was altered by neither NMDA nor kainate.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

A study was undertaken to determine whether emphysema and airway secretory cell metaplasia, induced in hamsters by intratracheal treatment with human neutrophil elastase ( HNE ), could be moderated by pretreatment with human alpha 1-protease inhibitor (API). API (4.9 mg) was given intratracheally to hamsters 1 h before 0.3 mg HNE. Eight weeks later, lung volumes and pressure-volume relationships were measured in the anaesthetized animals. Mean linear intercepts and secretory cell indices were measured in lung sections. API given 1 h before HNE moderated the development of bronchial secretory cell metaplasia. The severity of emphysema was reduced by 75%. Clearance studies indicated that 80% of the functional activity of instilled API could be lavaged from the lungs after 1 h, indicating a 4 h half-life in the lavageable compartment of the lungs. We calculate that for 50% protection from emphysema the molar ratio of lavageable API to HNE at the time of HNE instillation was 4.8 as compared with 0.78 for 50% inhibition of elastolytic activity in vitro, indicating that API is only 16% as efficient in vivo as compared with its in vitro HNE inhibitory effectiveness.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We describe that stimulation of human fibroblasts with platelet-derived growth factor BB ( PDGF -BB ) induces a transient up-regulation of the PDGF alpha- and beta-receptor transcript and protein levels. The effect of PDGF -BB on the receptor transcript levels was more pronounced than those seen when other cytokines were used. Regulation of transcript levels by PDGF -BB was mediated through post-transcriptional mechanisms. No induction could be observed in a nuclear run-on analysis, but cycloheximide treatment attenuated the accumulation of both alpha- and beta-receptor transcripts induced by PDGF -BB. An increase in receptor protein levels was observed using two different experimental approaches. Increased amounts of receptor precursor forms could be immunoprecipitated from metabolically labeled cells, stimulated with PDGF -BB. In a second approach, cells were exposed to different concentrations of PDGF -BB, and, in a subsequent step, ligand binding analysis was performed. In this experiment, an initial down-regulation of receptors was followed by increased levels of the cell surface forms of the receptors.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
In conclusion, <el> <re> PDGF <er>-BB <le>, but not <re> PDGF <er>-AA, induces increased synthesis of both <re> PDGF <er> alpha- and beta-receptor protein; this constitutes a positive feed-back mechanism, which, for example, could serve to potentiate autocrine stimulation of growth. positive----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

Glucose ingestion during exercise attenuates the release of the myokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) from working skeletal muscle, which results in a diminished increase in plasma IL-6. Interleukin-6 receptor alpha ( IL-6Ralpha ) expression in skeletal muscle is induced by acute exercise, mediated in part by an increased IL-6 concentration in the bloodstream. We hypothesized that endurance training would increase the density of IL-6Ralpha in skeletal muscle and that glucose ingestion would attenuate the effect. Nine subjects performed 10 weeks of one-legged knee-extensor training. They trained one leg (Glc-leg) while ingesting a glucose solution (Glc) and ingested a placebo (Plc) while training the other leg (Plc-leg). Endurance training increased peak power by 14% and reduced the exercise-induced gene expression of IL-6 and IL-6Ralpha in skeletal muscle and IL-6 plasma concentration. The IL-6Ralpha density increased to a lesser extent in the Glc-leg, suggesting that glucose ingestion attenuates the effect of training on IL-6Ralpha by blunting the IL-6 response.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The rat follitropin receptor ( rFSHR ) is an unusual G protein-coupled receptor in that agonist-induced activation leads to the phosphorylation of the first and third intracellular loops instead of the C-terminal tail. To determine regions of G protein-coupled receptors that affect internalization independently of phosphorylation we examined the effects of truncations of the C-terminal tail of the rFSHR on agonist-induced internalization. Our studies show that progressive truncations of a region flanked by residues 642 and 651 enhance the internalization of human follicle-stimulating hormone (hFSH). Further characterization of a mutant truncated at residue 649 (designated rFSHR -t649) and another mutant in which the 642-651 region was deleted in the context of the full-length rFSHR, designated rFSHR (Delta642-651), showed that both of them internalized hFSH at rates that were 2-3 times faster than rFSHR -wild type (wt). Like rFSHR -wt, however, the internalization of hFSH mediated by rFSHR -t649 and rFSHR (Delta642-651) can be inhibited with dominant-negative mutants of the non-visual arrestins or dynamin. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the 642-651 region suggests that the effects on internalization are not mediated by a single residue, however. In an attempt to understand the molecular basis of the enhanced internalization of hFSH mediated by these mutants we used an assay that can be readily used to assess the association of the rFSHR with the arrestin-3 in co-transfected cells.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
We conclude that a short linear sequence present in the C-terminal tail of the <el> <re> rFSHR <er> <le> (642SATHNFHARK651) that is not phosphorylated limits internalization by lowering the affinity of the <el> <re> rFSHR <er> <le> for the endogenous non-visual arrestins. positive----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

The yeast protein Sac1p is involved in a range of cellular functions, including inositol metabolism, actin cytoskeletal organization, endoplasmic reticulum ATP transport, phosphatidylinositol-phosphatidylcholine transfer protein function, and multiple-drug sensitivity. The activity of Sac1p and its relationship to these phenotypes are unresolved. We show here that the regulation of lipid phosphoinositides in sac1 mutants is defective, resulting in altered levels of all lipid phos- phoinositides, particularly phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. We have identified two proteins with homology to Sac1p that can suppress drug sensitivity and also restore the levels of the phosphoinositides in sac1 mutants. Overexpression of truncated forms of these suppressor genes confirmed that suppression was due to phosphoinositide phosphatase activity within these proteins. We have now demonstrated this activity for Sac1p and have characterized its specificity. The in vitro phosphatase activity and specificity of Sac1p were not altered by some mutations. Indeed, in vivo mutant Sac1p phosphatase activity also appeared unchanged under conditions in which cells were drug-resistant. However, under different growth conditions, both drug sensitivity and the phosphatase defect were manifest.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Ion transport can be regulated by dopamine receptors. D1-like receptors inhibit both Na +/H+ exchange (NHE) and Na +/K(+)-ATPase activity, whereas D2-like receptors stimulate NHE. However, the effect of D2-like receptors on Na +/K(+)-ATPase activity is controversial. In renal proximal tubular cells, where several D1-like and D2-like receptors are expressed, D2 agonists have been reported either to have no effect or to act in concert with D1 agonists to inhibit Na +/K(+)-ATPase activity. We therefore studied the effect of D2 receptors on Na +/K(+)-ATPase activity in LTK- cells transfected with a rat D2Long receptor cDNA (maximum receptor density = 0.91 +/- 0.26 pmol/mg protein, dissociation constant = 2.39 +/- 0.79 nM, seven experiments). The activation of D2 receptors in these transfected cells by the selective D2 agonist LY171555 led to the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. In the D2Long-transfected, but not in nontransfected cells, LY171555 caused a concentration-dependent stimulation of Na +/K(+)-ATPase activity (EC50 = 0.55 +/- 0.2 microM, Emax = 28 +/- 6%, six experiments), which was completely blocked by the D2-selective antagonist (-)-sulpiride. The D2-stimulated Na +/K(+)-ATPase activity was not secondary to D2 receptor activation of K+ channels or NHE activity since LY171555 stimulated Na +/K(+)-ATPase activity in D2Long-transfected cells, even when K+ channels were blocked by CsCl and intracellular Na + was clamped by monensin.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The megencephaly mice show dramatic progressive increase in brain size and seizures. The overgrowth affects primarily the hippocampus and ventral cortex. The phenotype originates from a mutation in the Shaker-like voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.1 brain, which results in a malfunctioning protein. A key question in elucidating the mechanism behind the unique brain overgrowth is whether it is caused by an increase in cell number. By applying stereological techniques, we found that the number of both neurons and astrocytes, as well as structure volume, was increased approximately two-fold within dentate gyrus (DG), CA2/3, and hilus of 12-week-old mceph/mceph versus wild type mice. In CA1, there was a tendency toward an increase in volume and in number of astrocytes. The volume estimates in newborn and p14 mice suggest that the overgrowth in mceph/mceph hippocampus starts between birth and the second week of life. To investigate the hyperplasia, cell proliferation was studied within the subgranular zone of the DG using BrdU and Ki67. There was a three-fold increase in proliferation in mceph/mceph mice compared to wild type mice at an age before onset of epileptic symptoms (3 weeks), and these new mceph/mceph neurons showed increased migration and had a 6-week survival rate as the new neurons in wild type DG. Also when seizures were frequent in mceph/mceph (9 weeks old), the proliferation rate was three-fold higher than in wild type. The number of TUNEL-positive cells in hippocampus was lower in mceph/mceph supporting additional overgrowth mechanism than induced by seizures.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The PTH type 1 receptor (PTH1R) and PTHrP are expressed in vessels, where they contribute to regulating vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) function. Elevated PTHrP levels in VSMC are often associated with hyperplasia. In contrast, exogenous PTHrP, acting through the PTH1R, inhibits VSMC proliferation. In this study, we investigated the regulation of PTH1R expression by endogenous PTHrP and the associated effects on VSMC proliferation. Blocking binding of secreted PTHrP fragments to the PTH1R by treatment with either an antagonist or an antibody against PTHrP, and inhibition of PTHrP expression by small interfering RNA significantly increased PTH1R expression. Interestingly, treatment of the cells with a PTHrP analog (Bpa(1)- PTHrP ) that activates the PTH1R without inducing its internalization had the same effect on receptor expression. To examine the association between receptor expression and the antiproliferative effect of N-terminal fragments of PTHrP, VSMC were treated with exogenous PTHrP (1-36) acutely and chronically to induce receptor down-regulation. Stimulation of VSMC with exogenous PTHrP (1-36) significantly reduced cell proliferation during the first 18 h of treatment but was no longer effective after 3 d, a time when PTH1R was down-regulated. In contrast, treatment with the noninternalizing agonist Bpa(1)- PTHrP strongly inhibited cell proliferation at all time points.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Human organic anion transporter 3 ( hOAT3 ) belongs to a family of organic anion transporters that play critical roles in the body disposition of numerous clinically important drugs. In the kidney, hOAT3 functions through a tertiary transport mechanism involving two other membrane proteins Na/K-ATPase and Na-dicarboxylate cotransporter. In the current study, we established COS-7 cells stably expressing hOAT3 and examined the regulation of hOAT3 by protein kinase C (PKC) and angiotensin II. Both PKC activation and angiotensin II inhibited hOAT3 transport activity. Angiotensin II induced inhibition of hOAT3 activity could be prevented by treating hOAT3 -expressing cells with staurosporine, a general inhibitor for PKC, and with Gö6976 (5,6,7,13-Tetrahydro-13-methyl-5-oxo-12H-indolo[2,3-a]pyrrolo[3,4-c]carbazole-12-propanenitrile), a PKCalpha-specific inhibitor. Examination of hOAT3 expression and transport kinetics revealed that angiotensin II induced inhibition of hOAT3 activity mainly resulted from a decreased cell surface expression kinetically reflected as a decreased V(max) without a significant change in K(m). Such angiotensin II induced decrease in cell surface expression of hOAT3 was caused by an increase in hOAT3 endocytosis. However, angiotensin II induced endocytosis of Na/K-ATPase did not occur under such condition.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The hemodynamic, cardiographic, and initial pharmacokinetic characteristics of the de novo administration of the 2-hydroxymetabolite ( 2-OH-IMI ) of imipramine (IMI), compared with its parent was studied in a swine preparation. Cardiac output, arterial pressure, and the continuous electrocardiogram were assessed after the intravenous administration of the drug or its metabolite. Plasma, sampled over 120 min and CSF sampled at 60 min were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC with spectroflurometric detection. Equilibrium dialyses were performed on plasma sampled at 60 min. 2-OH-IMI, in doses of 5-6 mg/kg, compared to dosages of IMI up to 8.5 mg/kg, produced a significantly greater incidence of life-threatening arrhythmias, and caused profound and significant decreases in blood pressure and cardiac output. 2-OH-IMI had a smaller volume of distribution (Vd) and shorter half-life.

At 4 degrees C and 22 degrees C BO-treated animals developed acute hypothermia (max delta Tre=-3.25 degrees C and -2.71 degrees C, respectively) which persisted for 2 hours (p less than 0.05). At 22 degrees C and at 300 min post-injection, BO-treated animals became significantly (p less than 0.05) hyperthermic (deltaTre = +1.28 degrees C) when compared to controls. While BR had no effects at 22 degrees C, en-injected rats demonstrated significant (p less than 0.05) hyperthermia from 180 min through 300 min (delta Tre=+1.40 degrees C). At 22 degrees C both BO and, surprisingly, EN increased Tsk (e.g. delta Tsk =+ 3.49 degrees C and + 2.01 degrees C at 60 min).

Combined disruption of the ARF gene and the p53 gene causes mouse predisposition to tumors of a wider variety and at a higher frequency than disruption of the p53 gene, indicating that the ARF gene has p53-independent anti-tumor function in addition to p53-dependent function.

The protein expression levels of p53, p21(Cip1), and Bax were not upregulated by ectopic expression of p19(ARF) in SV40-MEFs, indicating that expression of p19(ARF) induced apoptosis through p53-independent pathways in this system.

Extracellular nucleotides play important trophic roles in development and central nervous system (CNS) injury, but the functions of distinct purinergic receptors and related signaling pathways have not been fully elucidated. In the present study we identified opposing effects of P2X and P2Y receptors on the ability of FGF2 to induce proliferation in primary cultures of rat cortical astrocytes. Low concentrations of ATP enhanced DNA synthesis induced by FGF2, whereas high concentrations inhibited FGF2-induced proliferation. Comparison of concentration-response experiments with ATP and 2',3'-O-(4-benzoyl)-benzoyl-ATP (BzATP) indicated that the inhibitory effect was mediated by P2X(7) receptors. Interestingly, activation of P2X(7) receptors led to a state of reversible growth arrest rather than cell death. Selectivity studies showed that proliferation evoked by epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor was also inhibited by P2X(7) receptors, but P2X(1) or P2X(3) receptors did not inhibit proliferation induced by FGF2. A marker of mitosis, phosphohistone-3, was reduced by BzATP and increased by UTP, suggesting that the enhancing effect of ATP on FGF2-induced proliferation was mediated by P2 purine/pyrimidine receptors. Phosphorylation of the growth arrest-related protein kinase s p38/MAPK and SAPK/JNK was strongly increased by BzATP but only weakly affected by UTP.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

As inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase, clinical presentations of poisoning from organophosphate compounds are generally believed to entail overstimulation by the accumulated acetylcholine on muscarinic receptor s at peripheral and central synapses. That some patients still yielded to acute organophosphate poisoning despite repeated dosing of atropine suggests that cellular mechanisms that are independent of muscarinic receptor activation may also be engaged in organophosphate poisoning. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that muscarinic receptor -independent activation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase A ( PKA ) in rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), a medullary site where sympathetic vasomotor tone originates and where the organophosphate poison mevinphos (Mev) acts, is involved in the cardiovascular responses exhibited during organophosphate intoxication. In Sprague-Dawley rats, microinjection bilaterally of Mev (10 nmol) into the RVLM significantly augmented PKA activity in ventrolateral medulla that was not antagonized by coadministration of an equimolar concentration (1 nmol) of atropine or selective muscarinic receptor type M1 (pirenzepine), M2 (methoctramine), M3 (4-diphenyl-acetoxy-N-dimethylpiperidinium), or M4 (tropicamide) inhibitor.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We have demonstrated recently [Callera, Touyz, Teixeira, Muscara, Carvalho, Fortes, Schiffrin and Tostes (2003) Hypertension 42, 811-817] that increased vascular oxidative stress in DOCA (deoxycorticosterone acetate)-salt rats is associated with activation of the ET (endothelin) system via ETA receptors. The exact source of ET-1 -mediated oxidative stress remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether ET-1 increases generation of ROS (reactive oxygen species) in DOCA-salt hypertension through NADPH-oxidase-dependent mechanisms. Xanthine oxidase, eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase) and COX-2 (cyclo-oxygenase-2) were also examined as potential ET-1 sources of ROS as well as mitochondrial respiration. DOCA-salt and control UniNX (uninephrectomized) rats were treated with the ETA antagonist BMS182874 (40 mg.day(-1).kg(-1) of body weight) or vehicle. Plasma TBARS (thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances) were increased in DOCA-salt compared with UniNX rats. Activity of NADPH and xanthine oxidases in aorta, mesenteric arteries and heart was increased in DOCA-salt rats. BMS182874 decreased plasma TBARS levels without influencing NADPH and xanthine oxidase activities in DOCA-salt rats. Increased p22(phox) protein expression and increased p47(phox) membrane translocation in arteries from DOCA-salt by rats were not affected by BMS182874 treatment. Increased eNOS and COX-2 expression, also observed in aortas from DOCA-salt rats, was unaltered by BMS182874. Increased mitochondrial generation of ROS in DOCA-salt rats was normalized by BMS182874.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Testosterone replacement in hypogonadism has long been known to promote nitrogen retention and increase body density, but the mechanisms of nitrogen retention and body composition changes are poorly defined. We measured body composition and muscle protein synthesis in five hypogonadal men before and 6 months after initiating testosterone replacement. Body composition was examined using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Muscle mass was estimated both by excretion of creatinine on a meat-free diet and from appendicular mass measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Muscle protein synthesis was assessed by measuring the increment of [13C]leucine in mixed muscle protein and myosin heavy chain during a continuous infusion of L-[l-13C]leucine. In all subjects there was an increase in fat-free mass (average, 15%; range, 10-22%; P = 0.02) and a decrease in fat mass (-11%; range, -0.4% to -22.0%; P = 0.03). Muscle mass also increased in everybody (mean, 20%; range, 11-32%; P = 0.04) such that 65% of the increase in fat-free mass could be attributed to accretion of muscle. The accumulation of muscle was associated with a 56% (P = 0.015) increase in the fractional synthesis rate of mixed skeletal muscle proteins and a trend toward a similar increase in the fractional synthesis rate of myosin heavy chain (46%; P = 0.098).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Glucose is thought to stimulate insulin release from islet beta-cells through generation of metabolic signals. In the current study we have introduced the genes encoding the facilitated glucose transporters known as GLUT-1 and GLUT-2 into AtT-20ins cells to assess their impact on glucose -stimulated insulin release and glucose metabolism. We find that transfection of AtT-20ins cells with GLUT-2, but not GLUT-1, confers glucose -stimulated insulin release in both static incubation and perifusion studies. Cells transfected with GLUT-1 have a Km for 3-O-methyl glucose uptake of 4 mM and a Vmax of 5-6 mmol/min/liter cell space. These values are increased compared to untransfected AtT-20ins cells (Km = 2 mM; Vmax = 0.5 mmol/min/liter cell space), but are less than observed in GLUT-2-transfected lines (Km = 16-17 mM; Vmax = 17-25 mmol/min/liter cell space). Despite these dramatic differences in glucose transport affinity and capacity, the rates of [5-3H] glucose usage are not different in the control and transfected lines over a range of glucose concentrations from 10 microM to 20 mM.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), dibenzo[def,p]chrysene (DBC; also known as dibenzo[a,l]pyrene), is a potent carcinogen in animal models and a class 2A human carcinogen. Recent investigations into DBC-mediated toxicity identified DBC as a potent immunosuppressive agent similar to the well-studied immunotoxicant 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). DBC, like DMBA, is bioactivated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1B1 and forms the reactive metabolite DBC-11,12-diol-13,14-epoxide (DBCDE). DBCDE is largely responsible for the genotoxicity associated with DBC exposure. The immunosuppressive properties of several PAHs are also linked to genotoxic mechanisms. Therefore, this study was designed to identify DBCDE-DNA adduct formation in the spleen and thymus of wild-type and cytochrome P450 1b1 ( Cyp1b1 ) knockout (KO) mice using a highly sensitive stable-isotope dilution UHPLC-MS/MS method. Stable-isotope dilution UHPLC-MS/MS identified the major DBC adducts ()-anti-cis-DBCDE-dA and ()-anti-trans-DBCDE-dA in the lung, liver, and spleen of both WT and Cyp1b1 KO mice. However, adduct formation in the thymus was below the level of quantitation for our method. Additionally, adduct formation in Cyp1b1 KO mice was significantly reduced compared to wild-type (WT) mice receiving DBC via oral gavage.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Maintaining cellular homeostasis under changing nutrient conditions is essential for the growth and development of all organisms. The mechanisms that maintain homeostasis upon loss of nutrient supply are not well understood. By mapping the SUMO proteome in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we discovered a specific set of differentially sumoylated proteins mainly involved in transcription. RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) components, including Rpc53, Rpc82, and Ret1, are particularly prominent nutrient-dependent SUMO targets. Nitrogen starvation, as well as direct inhibition of the master nutrient response regulator target of rapamycin complex 1 ( TORC1 ), results in rapid desumoylation of these proteins, which is reflected by loss of SUMO at tRNA genes. TORC1 -dependent sumoylation of Rpc82 in particular is required for robust tRNA transcription. Mechanistically, sumoylation of Rpc82 is important for assembly of the RNAPIII holoenzyme and recruitment of Rpc82 to tRNA genes.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

A radioimmunoassay for inhibin was developed using a peptide containing the 1-26 amino acid sequence of the N-terminus of the alpha-chain of 32 kDa porcine inhibin as immunogen, and 125I-labelled tracer. Evaluation of this assay using Sephadex column chromatography, chromatoelectrophoresis and immunoblotting confirmed that it measured all forms of inhibin present in sheep follicular fluid and was suitable for measurement of inhibin in sheep plasma. There was no evidence of the presence of free alpha-subunit in either sheep follicular fluid or ovarian vein plasma. The concentration of inhibin in jugular plasma throughout the follicular and luteal phases of four ewes with ovarian autotransplants was measured. The ovarian secretion of inhibin and oestradiol were also measured simultaneously throughout the follicular phase in a spontaneous cycle and after infusion of NIH-oFSH-S14 at 10 micrograms/h for 48 h following premature luteal regression induced by prostaglandin. The results showed: (1) no change in the peripheral concentration of inhibin throughout the cycle except an increase related to the periovulatory increase in FSH and LH. (2) Following luteal regression, the concentration of FSH fell as the secretion rate of oestradiol increased. During this time there was no significant change in the peripheral concentration of inhibin or ovarian inhibin secretion rate. (3) Following the infusion of FSH there was a marked increase in the concentration of inhibin in both ovarian and peripheral plasma and an increase in ovarian inhibin secretion rate. (4) The calculated metabolic clearance rate of inhibin, 20.3 ml/min, is similar to that of FSH.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Endurance training at an intensity eliciting maximal fat oxidation may have a beneficial effect on body weight and glucose metabolism in obese patients. However, the exercise intensity at which maximal fat oxidation occurs and the factors limiting fat oxidation are not well studied in this population. Obese, otherwise healthy men (n=38) and women (n=91) performed an incremental exercise test up to exhaustion on a cycle ergometer. Substrate oxidation was estimated using indirect calorimetry. Magnetic resonance tomography and spectroscopy were conducted to assess body fat distribution and intramyocellular fat content. We determined the exercise intensity at which maximal body fat oxidation occurs and assessed whether body composition, body fat distribution, intramyocellular fat content, or oxidative capacity predict exercise-induced fat oxidation. Maximal exercise-induced fat oxidation was 0.30+/-0.02 g/min in men and 0.23+/-0.01 g/min in women (p0.05). Exercise intensity at the maximum fat oxidation was 42+/-2.2% VO (2 max) in men and 43+/-1.7% VO (2 max) in women. With multivariate analysis, exercise-induced fat oxidation was related to fat -free mass, percent fat mass, and oxidative capacity, but not to absolute fat mass, visceral fat, or intramyocellular fat content.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Cardiac dysfunction is a major consequence of sepsis/septic shock and contributes to the high mortality of sepsis. Innate and inflammatory responses mediated by TLRs play a critical role in sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction. MicroRNA-146 (miR-146) was first identified as a negative regulator in innate immune and inflammatory responses induced by LPS. This study examined whether miR-146a will have a protective effect on sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction. Lentivirus-expressing miR-146a (LmiR-146a) or lentivirus-expressing scrambled miR (LmiR-control) was delivered into the myocardium via the right carotid artery. Seven days after transfection, mice were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Untransfected mice were also subjected to CLP-induced sepsis. Cardiac function was examined by echocardiography before and 6 h after CLP. In vitro studies showed that increased miR-146a levels suppress LPS-induced IB phosphorylation and inflammatory cytokine production in both H9C2 cardiomyocytes and J774 macrophages. In vivo transfection of LmiR-146a attenuated sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction. The values for percent ejection fraction and percent fractional shortening in LmiR-146a-transfected CLP mice were significantly greater than in untransfected CLP control. LmiR-146a transfection prevented sepsis-induced NF-B activity, suppressed IRAK and TRAF6 expression in the myocardium, and attenuated sepsis-induced inflammatory cytokine production in both plasma and peritoneal fluid. In addition, LmiR-146a transfection decreased sepsis-induced infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the myocardium.

Indoxyl sulfate (IS) induces fibrosis and inflammation in kidneys via oxidative stress through the induction of transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1). Furthermore, IS is a potent endogenous agonist for aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which regulates the transcription of genes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1. Indole-3-propionic acid ( IPA ) is an antioxidant and has been reported to be neuroprotective. We determined whether IPA suppresses IS-induced expression of AHR, CYP1A1, TGF-1, and MCP-1 in proximal tubular cells. The effects of IS on the expression of AHR, CYP1A1, TGF-1, and MCP-1 were studied using normotensive rats and hypertensive rats. The effects of IPA on IS-induced expression of AHR, CYP1A1, TGF-1, and MCP-1 were studied using proximal tubular cells (HK-2). Furthermore, the effects of IPA on IS-induced expression and phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) were studied in HK-2 cells. Administration of IS induced the expression of AHR, CYP1A1, TGF-1, and MCP-1 in the tubular cells of rat kidneys. IPA significantly suppressed IS-induced mRNA and protein expression of AHR, CYP1A1, TGF-1, and MCP-1 in HK-2 cells.

Non-muscle myosin regulatory light chain ( nmMLC20 ) is reported to exert transcriptional function in regulation of gene expression, and NADPH oxidase (NOX)-derived reactive oxygen species contribute to vascular remodeling of pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH). This study aims to determine if nmMLC20 can promote endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) senescence and dysfunction through up-regulation of NOX in PAH rats. The rats were exposed to10% hypoxia for 3 weeks to establish a PAH model, which showed an increase in right ventricle systolic pressure, right ventricular and pulmonary vascular remodeling, and the accelerated senescence and impaired functions in EPCs, accompanied by an increase in Rho-kinase (ROCK) and NOX activities, p- nmMLC20 level, NOX expression and H2O2 content; these phenomena were reversed by fasudil, a selective inhibitor of ROCK. Next, normal EPCs were cultured under hypoxia to induce senescence in vitro. Consistent with the in vivo findings, hypoxia increased the senescence and dysfunction of EPCs concomitant with an increase in ROCK and NOX activities, p- nmMLC20 level, NOX expression and H2O2 content; these phenomena were reversed by fasudil.

Acylation stimulating protein (ASP) is a hormone produced by adipocytes and is of importance for the storage of energy as fat. We examined whether ASP might also have effects on islet function. In clonal INS-1 cells, ASP dose-dependently augmented glucose -stimulated insulin secretion. The lowest effective dose of ASP at 10 mmol/l glucose was 5 micro mol/l. The effect was glucose -dependent because ASP did not increase insulin secretion at 1 mmol/l glucose but had clear effect at 10 and 20 mmol/l glucose. Similarly, ASP augmented glyceraldehyde-induced insulin secretion but the hormone did not enhance insulin secretion in response to depolarization by 20 mmol/l of KCl. ASP-induced insulin secretion was completely abolished by competitive inhibition of glucose phosphorylation by glucokinase with 5-thio- glucose and was partially inhibited by the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, and by the protein kinase C inhibitor, GF109203. Furthermore, thapsigargin, an inhibitor of Ca(2+)-ATPase in the endoplasmic reticulum, did not affect ASP-induced insulin secretion. ASP (>5 micro mol/l) also augmented glucose -stimulated insulin secretion from islets isolated from C57BL/6J mice, and intravenous administration of ASP (50 nmol/kg) augmented the acute (1 and 5 min) insulin response to intravenous glucose (1 g/kg) in C57BL/6J mice. This was accompanied by an increased rate of glucose disposal.

PDBu increased Ca2+ sensitivity, an increase associated with a concentration-dependent, sustained increase in rMLC phosphorylation. PDBu altered the relationship between rMLC phosphorylation and isometric force such that the increase in isometric force was less than that expected for the increase in rMLC phosphorylation observed.

The animals were supplied with diet and water ad libitum for four weeks and they reached an average body weight of 100 g. Thereafter each group was then further randomly subdivided into three subgroups (six rats per subgroup): control, vehicle and AOM -injected groups. The control group did not receive any treatment (neither AOM injection nor saline), the rats in the vehicle group were given 1 mL intraperitoneal injection of saline once a week for two weeks and the rats in the AOM -injected group were given two intraperitoneal injections of AOM dissolved in saline once a week for two weeks totaling 30 mg/kg body weight.

Total and free concentrations of T4 and rT3 in serum and cerebrospinal fluid were estimated by ultrafiltration in 12 patients with unipolar endogenous depression before and after electroconvulsive treatment. Recovery from depression resulted in a decrease in CSF concentrations of free T4 (median) (26.2 to 21.4 pmol/l, p less than 0.02) and free rT3 (14.1 to 12.3 pmol/l, p less than 0.05).

In contrast, levels of free rT3 in the cerebrospinal fluid were considerably higher than those found in serum (p less than 0.01), the ratio being 25. These ratios did not change following recovery from depression. In 9 patients with nonthyroidal somatic illness, concentrations of free T4 and rT3 in the cerebrospinal fluid were similar to those found in patients with endogenous depression, whereas 4 hypothyroid patients and one hyperthyroid patient had considerably lower and higher, respectively, concentrations of both free T4 and rT3.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Smad proteins transduce transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-beta ) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signals that regulate cell growth and differentiation. We have identified YY1, a transcription factor that positively or negatively regulates transcription of many genes, as a novel Smad-interacting protein. YY1 represses the induction of immediate-early genes to TGF-beta and BMP, such as the plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 gene (PAI-1) and the inhibitor of differentiation/inhibitor of DNA binding 1 gene (Id-1). YY1 inhibits binding of Smads to their cognate DNA elements in vitro and blocks Smad recruitment to the Smad-binding element-rich region of the PAI-1 promoter in vivo. YY1 interacts with the conserved N-terminal Mad homology 1 domain of Smad4 and to a lesser extent with Smad1, Smad2, and Smad3. The YY1 zinc finger domain mediates the association with Smads and is necessary for the repressive effect of YY1 on Smad transcriptional activity. Moreover, downregulation of endogenous YY1 by antisense and small interfering RNA strategies results in enhanced transcriptional responses to TGF-beta or BMP. Ectopic expression of YY1 inhibits, while knockdown of endogenous YY1 enhances, TGF-beta - and BMP-induced cell differentiation. In contrast, overexpression or knockdown of YY1 does not affect growth inhibition induced by TGF-beta or BMP. Accordingly, YY1 does not interfere with the regulation of immediate-early genes involved in the TGF-beta growth-inhibitory response, the cell cycle inhibitors p15 and p21, and the proto-oncogene c-myc.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

ATP (1 mM) induced a biphasic increase in intracellular Ca2 + concentration ([ Ca2 +]i), i.e., an initial transient increase decayed to a level of sustained increase, in NG108-15 cells. The transient increase was inhibited by a phospholipase C inhibitor, 1-[6[[17beta-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl]amino]hexyl]-1H- pyrrole-2,5-dione (U73122), whereas the sustained increase was abolished by removal of external Ca2 +. We examined the mechanism of the ATP -elicited sustained [ Ca2 +]i increase using the fura-2 fluorescent method and the whole-cell patch clamp technique. ATP (1 mM) induced a membrane current with the reversal potential of 12.5 +/- 0.8 mV (n = 10) in Tyrode external solution. The EC50 of ATP was approximately 0.75 mM. The permeability ratio of various cations carrying this current was Na+ (defined as 1) > Li+ (0.92 +/- 0.01; n = 5) > K+ (0.89 +/- 0.03; n = 6) > Rb+ (0.55 +/- 0.02; n = 6) > Cs+ (0.51 +/- 0.01; n = 5) > Ca2 + (0.22 +/- 0.03; n = 3) > N-methyl-D-glucamine (0.13 +/- 0.01; n = 5), suggesting that ATP activated a nonselective cation current.

Reports of febrile, nonhemolytic transfusion reactions ( FNHTR ) occurring at hospitals served by a regional blood center supplying 99,658 units of blood during 1980 were analyzed to determine if leukocyte-poor red blood cells prepared by the inverted centrifugation technique (LP RBCs ) were adequate to prevent subsequent reactions. FNHTR occurred following 0.5% of units transfused. The records of transfusions given to patients who had a FNHTR were reviewed in a subgroup of hospitals.

Regional recruitment of dendritic cells ( DC s) by the local administration of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or Flt3-ligand (Flt3L) has vaccine adjuvant activity. However, Flt3L, with its DC growth factor activity, has not been extensively studied as a vaccine adjuvant, particularly as a plasmid vector. We report that the intramuscular ( IM ) injection of a Flt3L plasmid (pNGVL-hFlex), when formulated in a pluronic carrier (SP1017, Supratek Pharma, Inc., Laval, Que., Canada), recruits DC to the injection site and regional lymph nodes (LNs) and augments immune responses to a p17 HIV plasmid vaccine to a greater extent than the injection of a naked DNA vaccine alone. Following IM administration of pNGVL-hFlex, Flt3L mRNA, Flt3L protein and infiltrating DC accumulate at the injection site. The number of DC in the draining LNs are also significantly increased with the greatest increase observed following injection of 2.5 microg of pNGVL-hFlex formulated in 0.01% SP1017. Flow cytometric studies demonstrate that the LN-infiltrating DC is mainly of the CD11c(+)CD11b(-) phenotype (IL-12 producing). Further, the co-injection of pNGVL3-hFlex and p17 HIV plasmids, formulated in SP1017, significantly increases the immune responses to the plasmid vaccine (pVAX-gag).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

To maintain bone mass turnover and bone mineral density (BMD), bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are constantly recruited and subsequently differentiated into osteoblasts. HIV-infected patients present lower BMD than non-HIV infected individuals and a higher prevalence of osteopenia/osteoporosis. In antiretroviral treatment (ART)-naive patients, encoded HIV proteins represent pathogenic candidates. They are released by infected cells within BM and can impact on neighbouring cells. In this study, we tested whether HIV proteins Tat and/or Nef could induce senescence of human BM-MSCs and reduce their capacity to differentiate into osteoblasts. When compared to nontreated cells, MSCs chronically treated with Tat and/or Nef up to 30 days reduced their proliferative activity and underwent early senescence, associated with increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. The antioxidant molecule N-acetyl- cysteine had no or minimal effects on Tat - or Nef-induced senescence. Tat but not Nef induced an early increase in NF-B activity and cytokine/chemokine secretion. Tat -induced effects were prevented by the NF-B inhibitor parthenolide, indicating that Tat triggered senescence via NF-B activation leading to oxidative stress. Otherwise, Nef- but not Tat -treated cells displayed early inhibition of autophagy. Rapamycin, an autophagy inducer, reversed Nef-induced senescence and oxidative stress. Moreover, Tat +Nef had cumulative effects. Finally, Tat and/or Nef decreased the MSC potential of osteoblastic differentiation.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The serine proteinases proteinase 3 (PR3) and elastase are target antigens of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCAs), which are found in various systemic vasculitides with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN). The expression of both proteinases was studied immunohistologically (avidin-biotin complex method) with murine monoclonal antibodies against PR3 (WGM2) and elastase (NP 57) in 122 human renal biopsy specimens to investigate their role in mediating renal damage. Expression of PR3 predominated in ANCA-associated RPGN and was independent of the serologic ANCA pattern (c-/p-ANCA). The PR3 staining pattern was patchy and not always related to distint granulocytes due to antigen spreading by disintegrating cells. It was found in crescentic glomeruli and the interstitum of ANCA-positive RPGN. In contrast, glomerular and interstitial elastase staining pattern was much more granulocyte related and was even found in noncrescentic glomeruli in c-ANCA- and p-ANCA-positive pauci-immune RPGN. Endothelial cell and glomerular basement membrane-bound PR3 or elastase expression were not observed. A faint glomerular PR3/ elastase expression was seen in Goodpasture's syndrome and within the interstitium in crescentic mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (granulocyte related).

Malathion is an organophosphate widely used as an insecticide in agriculture and in public health programs, causing risk to human health. As was recently reported, malathion induces depressant-like behavior and oxidative damage to the brain of rodents. Given the relevance of searching for neuroprotective agents against such damage, this study was therefore undertaken to investigate the neuroprotective potential of zinc in dealing with malathion -related toxicity. Female Wistar rats were exposed to malathion (50 and 100 mg/kg, ip) and/or zinc chloride (ZnCl2; 5 mg/kg, ip) for 3 days. Malathion produced a depressant-like effect, observed by the increased immobility time in the forced swimming test ( FST ), without affecting total locomotor activity and rearing in the open-field. However, malathion administered at 50 mg/kg reduced the central time in the arena and at the dose of 100 mg/kg reduced the central locomotion. These effects were completely reversed by ZnCl2. Exposure to malathion (50 mg/kg, ip) and/or ZnCl2 did not affect AChE activity in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and blood. Malathion (50 mg/kg, ip) alone caused some harmful effects, such as (1) an increase in lipid peroxidation and a reduction of glutathione peroxidase activity in the cerebral cortex, (2) reduction of glutathione reductase activity in the hippocampus, and (3) changes in the structure of chromatin in the dentate gyrus, all effects attenuated by ZnCl2.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

ACh -induced contraction of esophageal circular muscle (ESO) depends on Ca2+ influx and activation of protein kinase Cepsilon (PKCepsilon). PKCepsilon, however, is known to be Ca2+ independent. To determine where Ca2+ is needed in this PKCepsilon-mediated contractile pathway, we examined successive steps in Ca2+-induced contraction of ESO muscle cells permeabilized by saponin. Ca2+ (0.2-1.0 microM) produced a concentration-dependent contraction that was antagonized by antibodies against PKCepsilon (but not by PKCbetaII or PKCgamma antibodies), by a calmodulin inhibitor, by MLCK inhibitors, or by GDPbetas. Addition of 1 microM Ca2+ to permeable cells caused myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which was inhibited by the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine, by D609 [phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C inhibitor], and by propranolol (phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase inhibitor). Ca2+-induced contraction and diacylglycerol (DAG) production were reduced by D609 and by propranolol, alone or in combination. In addition, contraction was reduced by AACOCF(3) (cytosolic phospholipase A(2) inhibitor). These data suggest that Ca2+ may directly activate phospholipase s, producing DAG and arachidonic acid (AA), and PKCepsilon, which may indirectly cause phosphorylation of MLC. In addition, direct G protein activation by GTPgammaS augmented Ca2+-induced contraction and caused dose-dependent production of DAG, which was antagonized by D609 and propranolol.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Based on the knowledge that diagnostic fine needle biopsy of the thyroid (FNAB) results in a prompt increase in circulating thyroglobulin ( Tg ); we evaluated whether Tg is indeed the postulated antigen for circulating antibodies against thyroid hormones ( THAb ). Preliminarily, we verified that FNAB causes the release into the bloodstream of iodinated, heterologous, and thus potentially immunogenic, molecules of Tg. Of the initially enrolled 400 patients, 214 had a number of blood drawings sufficient to evaluate over time (before FNAB and 1-3 h, 3 days, 15 days, 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after FNAB) the following parameters: THAb of both IgM and IgG classes, Tg antibodies ( Tg Ab; by a sensitive immunoradiometric assay), and Tg (in the 156 patients who were Tg Ab negative). We found the following. 1) Serum Tg most often peaks 1-3 h after FNAB (61 +/- 45% of the baseline level; mean +/- SD). 2) Only 7% of the initially Tg Ab-negative patients converted to positive, and only 12% of those initially positive had an increase in the levels of Tg Ab. 3) THAb were detected in 0 of 400 patients before FNAB, but were found in 9 of 214 (4.2%) after FNAB. This proportion is 2 orders of magnitude higher than that (149 of 369,000 or 0.04%) found in consecutive patients attending European thyroid clinics. Of the 9 cases, 6 had Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), 2 had euthyroid colloid goiter, and 1 had Hurthle cell carcinoma. In the 5 of 9 cases who were Tg Ab negative, the post-FNAB increment in Tg was 21-99%, i.e. lower than that of the majority of patients (101-12,500%).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Sepsis is a severe clinical disease, which is resulted from the excessive host inflammation response to the infection. Growing evidence indicates that Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia is a significant cause of sepsis, which can lead to intestinal injury, inflammation, and apoptosis. Studies have shown that miR-182-5p can serve as a tumor oncogene or a tumor suppressive microRNA in various cancers, however, its biological role in sepsis is still uninvestigated. Here, we reported that miR-182-5p was obviously increased in S. aureus pneumonia mice models. Loss of miR-182-5p inhibited intestinal damage and intestinal apoptosis as indicated by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay. In addition, we observed the lack of miR-182-5p altered the local inflammatory response to pneumonia in the intestine. Elevated tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were observed in intestinal tissue of pneumonia groups compared with the shams. Furthermore, miR-182-5p knockout (KO) pneumonia group demonstrated decreased levels of intestinal TNF- and IL-6. Primary murine intestinal epithelial cells were isolated and cultured in our investigation. We exhibited downregulation of miR-182-5p repressed intestinal epithelial cells apoptosis and rescued the cell viability. Meanwhile, miR-182-5p caused elevated cell apoptosis and reduced cell proliferation. Moreover, the surfactant protein D (SP-D) binds with the bacterial pathogens and remove the pathogens and apoptotic bodies, which exhibits important roles in modulating immune responses.

Swine granulosa cells respond to follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and the insulin-like growth factor, IGF-I (somatomedin C), with synergistic increases in progesterone production. This facilitative interaction was not attributable to decreased catabolism of progesterone to 20 alpha-hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one, but rather to enhanced pregnenolone biosynthesis observed in response to provision of 25-hydroxycholesterol as exogenous sterol substrate. The latter evidence of increased functional cholesterol side-chain cleavage activity was accompanied by augmented incorporation of [35S]methionine into specific immunoisolated components of the cholesterol side-chain cleavage apparatus, viz. cytochrome P-450scc and adrenodoxin. The synergism between FSH and IGF-I could be sustained over 4 days of serum-free monolayer culture. Under these conditions, compactin, a competitive inhibitor of de novo endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis, suppressed stimulated progesterone production by approximately equal to 50%. However, synergism was not expressed at the levels of [14C]acetate incorporation into nonsaponifiable lipids or endogenous 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity per se. Conversely, exogenous sterol substrate provided in the form of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-borne cholesterol increased the absolute magnitude of the combined actions of IGF-I and FSH by 3-6-fold. This increase in steroidogenesis in response to LDL was associated with enhanced surface binding, internalization, and degradation of [125I] iodo-LDL.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The effects of calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP ) I(alpha) (human), CGRP II(beta) (human), CGRP (rat), and [Tyr0]- CGRP (rat) on the resting tone of opossum internal anal sphincter ( IAS ) were studied. Different CGRP s identified above produced a concentration-dependent fall in the resting tension of the IAS. CGRP II (human) was most potent, while [Tyr0]- CGRP (rat) was the least. The fall in IAS tension caused by CGRP II (human) was not modified by the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin, beta adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol and prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor indomethacin. In contrast to the other CGRP analogs, [Tyr0]- CGRP 28-37 (rat) produced no significant effects on the resting tension of the IAS. However, the fragment caused significant rightward shifts in the concentration-effect curves of different CGRP analogs examined on the IAS. [Tyr0]- CGRP 28-37 (rat) was found to be almost equipotent in antagonizing the inhibitory effects of CGRP (rat) and [Tyr0]- CGRP (rat), but was approximately 12 and 4 times more potent in antagonizing the responses of CGRP I (human) and CGRP II (human), respectively, as compared to that of CGRP (rat) and [Tyr0]- CGRP (rat).

The proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) induced by injury to the intima of arteries is an important etiologic factor in vascular proliferative disorders such as atherosclerosis and restenosis. Esculetin, derived from the Chinese herb Artemisia scoparia, is well known as a lipoxygenase inhibitor. We have investigated the inhibitory effects of esculetin on VSMC proliferation and intimal hyperplasia by balloon angioplasty in the rat. We determined, using [3H]thymidine incorporation and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, that esculetin inhibited the proliferation of VSMCs via a lipoxygenase-independent pathway. Three predominant signaling pathways were identified to be inhibited by esculetin : (a) the activation of p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the downstream effectors of c-fos and c-jun immediate early genes by means of western and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses; (b) the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ), using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay; and (c) the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and cell cycle progression, by western blot analysis and flow cytometric detection.

Activation of hepatic stellate cells ( HSC s) is a critical step that leads to the development of liver fibrosis. We showed that astaxanthin ( ASTX ), a xanthophyll carotenoid, displays antifibrogenic effects in LX-2 cells, a human HSC cell line. In this study, we further determined the effect of ASTX on HSC activation and inactivation using primary HSC s from C57BL/6J mice. Quiescent and activated HSC s were incubated with ASTX (25M) at different stages of activation. ASTX prevented the activation of quiescent HSC s, as evidenced by the presence of intracellular lipid droplets and reduction of -smooth muscle actin, an HSC activation marker. Also, ASTX reverted activated HSC s to a quiescent phenotype with the reappearance of lipid droplets with a concomitant increase in lecithin retinol acyltransferase mRNA. Cellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species was significantly reduced by ASTX, which was attributable to a decrease in NADPH oxidase 2 expression. The antifibrogenic effect of ASTX was independent of nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 as it was observed in HSC s from wild-type and Nrf2(-/-) mice.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

To evaluate anti-emetic efficacy of ondansetron in the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by Cisplatin containing cancer chemotherapy regimen, we carried out an open multicentre study from January 1991 to December 1992. In this study, patients receiving Cisplatin based chemotherapy received ondansetron 32 mg as a single intravenous dose over 15 minutes prior to the administration of Cisplatin. This was followed by oral ondansetron 8 mg three times a day, preferably one hour before each meal for 5 days. All patients were chemotherapy naive in-patients and were at least 18 years or older with Karnofsky performance status of at least 60 per cent. The number of emetic episodes, nausea and food intake were recorded during the 24 hours following Cisplatin administration. A total of 103 patients were recruited with 84 (81.6%) evaluable patients (48 men and 36 women) scheduled to receive cisplatin chemotherapy at dose 60 mg/m2 or more (60-100 mg/m2), either as single agent or combination therapy. Complete response (complete control of emesis ) was achieved in 60 per cent; major response (1-2 emetic episodes) was 13 per cent; minor response (3-5 emetic episodes) was 13 per cent; and failure (5+ emetic episodes) was 10 per cent. Side effects were very mild and not significant.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Exposure of the gonadotrope cells to gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) reduces their responsiveness to a new GnRH stimulation (homologous desensitization). The time frame as well as the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are yet unclear. We studied in a gonadotrope cell line (alphaT3-1) the effects of short as well as long term GnRH pretreatments on the GnRH -induced phospholipases-C (PLC), -A2 (PLA2) and -D ( PLD ) activities, by measuring the production of IP3, total inositol phosphates (IPs), arachidonic acid (AA) and phosphatidylethanol (PEt) respectively. We demonstrated that although rapid desensitization of GnRH -induced IP3 formation did not occur in these cells, persistent stimulation of cells with GnRH or its analogue resulted in a time-dependent attenuation of GnRH -elicited IPs formation. GnRH -induced IPs desensitization was potentiated after direct activation of PKC by the phorbol ester TPA, suggesting the involvement of distinct mechanisms in the uncoupling exerted by either GnRH or TPA on GnRH -stimulated PI hydrolysis. The levels of individual phosphoinositides remained unchanged under any desensitization condition applied. Interestingly, while the GnRH -induced PLA2 activity was rapidly desensitized (2.5 min) after GnRH pretreatments, the neuropeptide-evoked PLD activation was affected at later times, indicating an important time-dependent contribution of these enzymatic activities in the sequential events underlying the GnRH -induced homologous desensitization processes in the gonadotropes.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
In conclusion, in alphaT3-1 cells the <el> GnRH <le>-induced homologous desensitization affects the <el> GnRH <le> coupling with PLC, PLA2 and <re> PLD <er> by mechanism(s) which do not implicate TPA-sensitive PKC isoforms, but likely reflect time-dependent modification(s) on the activation processes of the enzymes. positive----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

Adjuvant interleukin (IL)-2 immunotherapy has been used in the treatment of different malignant dieseases. However, clinical results have been rather disappointing. Therefore, further investigations on IL-2 -induced mediators of cytotoxicity seem to be necessary in order to possibly create cytokine cocktails which could enhance the IL-2 -induced cytotoxicity. We therefore investigated the regulation of IL-2 -induced release of soluble Fas Ligand (sFasL), since this factor is known to possess anti-tumor activities. In CD3-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells IL-2 induced sFasL in a dose-dependent fashion. Maximum sFasL concentrations were obtained after stimulation of MNC for 120 hrs. Inhibition of endogenous IL-12 production significantly reduced IL-2 -mediated sFasL release by about 25%. In contrast, addition of IL-12 enhanced the IL-2 -induced sFasL about 1,5-fold. IL-10 and IL-4 reduced the IL-2 -stimulated sFasL by about 30%. Interestingly, these suppressive effects could be antagonized by the addition of IL-12. Not only exogenous IL-10 but also endogenously produced IL-10 decreased the sFasL release to that extent which had been stimulated by IL-12. Since IL-12 and IL-10 only marginally influenced the IL-2 -mediated cell proliferation as well as the IL-2 -induced cell death, the IL-12 - and IL-10-controlled sFasL release seems to be based on an enhanced production per cell. However, the increase in cell numbers as well as the decrease of viability during cell culture might additionally contribute to the IL-2 -induced increase of sFasL release.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

In previous studies we have shown that injection of the insect growth regulator Azadirachtin ( AZA ) into young vitellogenic females induces inhibition of vitellogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. Juvenile hormone treatment rescues vitellogenin synthesis and ovarian growth. The cytopathological effects on ovaries and fat body are not linked to an inhibition of feeding. In this work we investigated the effects of AZA on the endocrine and neuroendocrine system. Enzyme immunoassay reveals that ovarian ecdysteroid levels are drastically reduced, in a dose-dependent fashion, by AZA. Ultrastructural study indicates that corpus allatum cells exhibit signs of inactivity and degenerative changes after AZA exposure.

Hypnosis and acupuncture can alleviate experimentally induced pain but the mechanism of analgesia remains unclear for both techniques. Experimental pain was induced by cold pressor test (CPT) in 8 male volunteers. Analgesic effect of hypnosis (HA) and acupuncture ( AA ) was assessed before and after double-blind administration of placebo or naloxone, in a prospective, cross-over study. We found that pain intensity was significantly lower with HA as compared with AA, both with naloxone (P less than 0.001) and placebo (P less than 0.001). Within HA or AA groups, pain scores did not differ significantly when naloxone or placebo was administered. During AA, however, pain scores were similar to control values when naloxone was given (P = 0.05) but decreased significantly with placebo (P less than 0.002). Analog scales for pain intensity and pain relief showed a good correlation (r = 0.94). Plasma levels of beta-endorphins did not change significantly in any combination. Heart rate, peripheral arterial blood pressure and skin conductance were very insensitive indices to assess pain intensity or relief, as well as intensity of acupuncture stimulation or depth of hypnotic trance.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Ribavirin in combination with interferon- is the standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C, but often induces severe anemia forcing discontinuation of the therapy. Whereas suppression of bone marrow by interferon may impact on the production of erythrocytes, it has been suggested that accumulation of ribavirin in erythrocytes induces alterations causing an early removal of these cells by the mononuclear phagocytic system. Externalization of phosphatidylserine, which is exclusively present in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane, is a recognition signal for phagocytosis in particular of apoptotic cells. Here, we demonstrate that surface exposure of phosphatidylserine upon prolonged treatment of erythrocytes with ribavirin results mainly from inactivation of the aminophospholipid translocase, an ATP-dependent lipid pump, which specifically transports phosphatidylserine from the outer to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Inactivation is due to severe ATP depletion, although competitive inhibition by ribavirin or its phosphorylated derivatives cannot be excluded. Phospholipid scramblase, responsible for collapse of lipid asymmetry, appears to be of minor importance as erythrocytes of patients with the Scott syndrome, lacking Ca(2+)-induced lipid scrambling, are equally sensitive to ribavirin treatment. Neither the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine nor the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPH did affect ribavirin -induced phosphatidylserine exposure, suggesting that oxidative stress or apoptotic-related mechanisms are not involved in this process.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
In conclusion, we propose that spontaneous loss of lipid asymmetry, not corrected by aminophospholipid translocase activity, is the mechanism for <el> ribavirin <le>-induced phosphatidylserine exposure that may contribute to <el> ribavirin <le>-induced <re> anemia <er>. positive----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

MicroRNA-27a ( miR-27a ) modulates osteogenic differentiation (OD); however, the mechanism by which it influences osteoclastic activity in the glucocorticoid (GC)-elicited osteoporotic bone is still unclear. Bone marrow was obtained from the proximal femur of patients (n = 3) with a femoral neck fracture and those (n = 3) with steroid-related osteonecrosis of the femoral head ( ONFH ). GC was applied to an established ONFH cell model from human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs). The miR-27a expression profiles were found to be downregulated in ONFH samples and GC-induced hBMSCs using microarray analysis and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, whereas the OD capacity of hBMSCs was significantly reduced in the GC group compared with the control group. Subsequent transfection of an miR-27a mimic in hBMSCs revealed that the OD capacity of cells was remarkably strengthened in the GC group compared with the miR-control group. Bioinformatics software (TargetScan) predicted that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) might be a potential miR-27a target, which was indicated by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Compared with the control group, the GC group exhibited a significantly downregulated protein expression level of PI3K and its downstream protein kinase B (Akt) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) expression. Furthermore, administration of 10 M 740 Y-P, a cell-permeable phosphopeptide activator of PI3K, to hBMSCs increased the expression of Akt and mTOR.

Glutathione (GSH) and its precursor cysteine (Cys) are both known to react within any cells with oxidative species and thus play an important role in cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative stress. In melanocytes, these are also important precursors of melanogenesis by reacting non-enzymatically with l-dopaquinone to form the sulfur-containing pheomelanin. Our aim was to assess pigment role in the cellular radioprotection mechanism using a human melanoma cell model of mixed-type melanin under GSH depletion to obtain a radiosensitizing effect. The latter has been achieved either by Cys deprivation or GSH specific depletion. We first compared cell survival of Cys-deprived and GSH-depleted cells vs. control cells. Cys deprivation was achieved by decreasing Cys concentration in the culture medium for 24 h. In this condition, no toxicity was observed, Cys and GSH levels decreased, melanogenesis switched to a higher eumelanin synthesis and cells were significantly more resistant to 10-Gy dose of ionizing radiations than untreated cells. Glutathione depletion was achieved with the gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase inhibitor buthionine-S-sulfoximine (BSO) for 24 h at 50 microM, a concentration yielding no toxicity. In this condition, intracellular GSH level decreased but no change in pigmentation was observed and cells were slightly but significantly more sensitive to radiation than the control. We then compared DNA radio-induced damages by Comet assay in control cells, cells treated as above and cells with stimulated pigmentation by increasing Tyr concentration in the medium. Our results showed that, when intracellular eumelanin content increased, DNA damage decreased. By contrast, DNA damage increased in cells treated with BSO alone.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Inhibition of the Akt kinase activates HPV16 late gene expression by reducing HPV16 early polyadenylation and by activating HPV16 late L1 mRNA splicing. We identified 'hot spots' for RNA binding proteins at the early polyA signal and at splice sites on HPV16 late mRNAs. We observed that hnRNP L was associated with sequences at all HPV16 late splice sites and at the early polyA signal. Akt kinase inhibition resulted in hnRNP L dephosphorylation and reduced association of hnRNP L with HPV16 mRNAs. This was accompanied by an increased binding of U2AF65 and Sam68 to HPV16 mRNAs. Furthermore, siRNA knock-down of hnRNP L or Akt induced HPV16 gene expression. Treatment of HPV16 immortalized keratinocytes with Akt kinase inhibitor reduced hnRNP L binding to HPV16 mRNAs and induced HPV16 L1 mRNA production.

Carrageenan ( CGN ) has been shown to cause inflammation through toll-like receptor 4, which may play an important role in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Selenoprotein P (SeP) has recently been identified as a novel hepatokine that causes insulin resistance. Here, we report that treatment of HepG2 cells with CGN increased both CCAAT enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) and SeP expression. Pretreatment with 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA), an endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibitor, and PD98059, a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor, reversed CGN -induced SeP expression. Moreover, both 4-PBA and knock-down of SeP improved CGN -induced insulin resistance.

Pathway-selective insulin resistance where insulin fails to suppress hepatic glucose production but promotes liver fat storage may underlie glucose and lipid abnormalities after menopause. We tested the mechanisms by which estrogen treatment may alter the impact of a high-fat diet (HFD) when given at the time of ovariectomy (OVX) in mice. Female C57BL/6J mice underwent sham operation, OVX, or OVX with estradiol (E2) treatment and were fed an HFD. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps were used to assess insulin sensitivity, tracer incorporation into hepatic lipids, and liver triglyceride export. OVX mice had increased adiposity that was prevented with E2 at the time of OVX. E2 treatment increased insulin sensitivity with OVX and HFD. In sham and OVX mice, HFD feeding induced fatty liver, and insulin reduced hepatic apoB100 and liver triglyceride export. E2 treatment reduced liver lipid deposition and prevented the decrease in liver triglyceride export during hyperinsulinemia. In mice lacking the liver estrogen receptor, E2 after OVX limited adiposity but failed to improve insulin sensitivity, to limit liver lipid deposition, and to prevent insulin suppression of liver triglyceride export.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) are slow-growing brain tumor s that are a hallmark feature seen in 5-10% of patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). Though histologically benign, they can cause serious neurologic symptoms, leading to death if untreated. SEGAs consistently show biallelic loss of TSC1 or TSC2. Herein, we aimed to define other somatic events beyond TSC1 /TSC2 loss and identify potential transcriptional drivers that contribute to SEGA formation. Paired tumor -normal whole-exome sequencing was performed on 21 resected SEGAs from 20 TSC patients. Pathogenic variants in TSC1 /TSC2 were identified in 19/21 (90%) SEGAs. Copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (size range: 2.2-46 Mb) was seen in 76% (16/21) of SEGAs (44% chr9q and 56% chr16p). An average of 1.4 other somatic variants (range 0-7) per tumor were identified, unlikely of pathogenic significance.

The conditioned taste aversion procedure in mice was used to test for blockade of the drug stimulus of the 5-HT1A receptor agonists (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin HBr ( 8-OH-DPAT ), 1-(4-trifluoromethyl-2-pyridinyl)-4- [4-[2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl]butyl]piperazine (E)-2-butenedioate (Org 13011) and the 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. The conditioned taste aversion induced by 8-OH-DPAT (0.22 mg/kg) and Org 13011 (0.5 mg/kg) was readily blocked by the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide trihydrochloride (WAY-100635) (0.1 mg/kg).

Recent reports show that protein kinase A ( PKA ), but not exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC), acts in a cell autonomous manner to constitutively reduce the angiogenic sprouting capacity of murine and human endothelial cells. Specificity in the cellular actions of individual cAMP -effectors can be achieved when a cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzyme acts locally to control the "pool" of cAMP that activates the cAMP -effector. Here, we examined whether PDEs coordinate the actions of PKA during endothelial cell sprouting. Inhibiting each of the cAMP -hydrolyzing PDEs expressed in human endothelial cells revealed that phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) inhibition with cilostamide reduced angiogenic sprouting in vitro, while inhibitors of PDE2 and PDE4 family enzymes had no such effect. Identifying a critical role for PDE3B in the anti-angiogenic effects of cilostamide, silencing this PDE3 variant, but not PDE3A, markedly impaired sprouting. Importantly, using both in vitro and ex vivo models of angiogenesis, we show the hypo-sprouting phenotype induced by PDE3 inhibition or PDE3B silencing was reversed by PKA inhibition. Examination of the individual cellular events required for sprouting revealed that PDE3B and PKA each regulated angiogenic sprouting by controlling the invasive capacity of endothelial cells, more specifically, by regulating podosome rosette biogenesis and matrix degradation. In support of the idea that PDE3B acts to inhibit angiogenic sprouting by limiting PKA -mediated reductions in active cdc42, the effects of PDE3B and/or PKA on angiogenic sprouting were negated in cells with reduced cdc42 expression or activity.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Adrenergic mechanisms for the pressor actions of blood-borne L-norepinephrine ( NE ) and fowl angiotensin II (ANG II) were studied in barbiturate-anesthetized adult ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). NE (1.5-6.0 nmol X kg-1) or ANG II (0.4-1.6 nmol X kg-1) injected iv caused dose-dependent increases in mean arterial pressure ( Pa ) and pulse pressure (Pp) but slowed cardiac frequency (fH); higher doses of ANG II increased Pa, Pp, and fH X beta-Adrenergic blockade by propranolol lowered baseline Pa, completely blocked cardiovascular responses to isoproterenol, augmented the bradycardic effect of NE, and inhibited the stimulation of Pp by ANG II. However, the tachycardiac effect of high-dose ANG II persisted during beta-blockade. alpha-Adrenergic blockade following iv prazosin completely blocked the pressor effect of methoxamine, diminished the pressure response to NE, and decreased Pa sensitivity to ANG II injections. Combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade decreased both the sensitivity and the maximal Pa response to ANG II.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
We conclude that (i) beta-adrenergic mechanisms predominate in the maintenance of resting <re> Pa <er>, (ii) <el> NE <le> increases <re> Pa <er> principally by alpha-adrenergic action while beta-adrenergic stimulation buffers the consequent bradycardia, and (iii) although the positive chronotropic effect of high doses of ANG II probably is not mediated by catecholamines, low doses of ANG II elevate <re> Pa <er> and Pp by alpha- and beta-adrenergic mechanisms. positive----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

The present study is designed to evaluate the relationship between gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and GnRH receptor ( GnRHR ) gene expression during the steroid-induced LH surge. One week after ovariectomy (OVX), a capsule containing 17beta-estradiol (E) or vehicle (V) was implanted into OVX rats, and 2 days later a single injection of progesterone (P) or V was administered s.c. at 10:00 h. Poly(A)-rich RNA samples were isolated from the micropunches of the preoptic area (POA) and the posterior mediobasal hypothalamus (pMBH) from both sides of individual brain slices. Using competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) procedures, three parameters (POA GnRH, pMBH GnRHR ) and pituitary GnRHR mRNA levels were simultaneously determined in each individual animal. POA GnRH mRNA and pituitary GnRHR mRNA levels were decreased by treatment with E, but increased by a combination of E and P. In contrast, pMBH GnRHR mRNA levels were clearly augmented by treatment with E, and decreased by the combination of E and P. Temporal changes in such parameters were determined in OVX+E+V- and OVX+E+P-treated rats. P augmented POA GnRH mRNA levels at the time of the LH surge (17:00 h) and the increased GnRH mRNA levels were remained until 22:00 h, while E alone failed to alter POA GnRH mRNA levels.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We analysed mRNA and protein localization of the IGF system components in regions with apoptosis during mouse development between 9.5 and 13.5 days post coitum. A spatio-temporal relationship between these expression patterns and the onset of apoptosis in specific areas was sought. The IGFBP mRNA and protein expression patterns were tissue-specific. In most tissues, mRNA expression patterns colocalized with protein localization. Discrepancies between mRNA and protein detection were found in, for example, lens, neural layer of the retina, whiskers and somites. Localization of the IGFs, the type I IGF receptor and IGFBP-2 correlated well with cell death regions. When these genes were expressed no apoptosis occurred and vice versa. Correlation of IGFBP-3, -4 and -5 with apoptosis regions was noticed only at 13.5 days post coitum. In eye muscles, whiskers and somites, the expression of IGF system components preceded the occurrence of apoptotic cells.

Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a member of a family of chemotactic cytokines that induce directed migration of leukocytes via activation of seven-transmembrane domain receptors. To identify G-proteins that couple to the two forms of the MCP-1 receptor, as well as to related chemokine receptors, we have performed cotransfection experiments in mammalian cells. In COS-7 cells, the type A and type B MCP-1 receptors coupled to Galphai, Galphaq, and Galpha16, whereas the macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha/RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell-expressed and secreted) receptor (C-CR1) coupled to Galphai and Galphaq but failed to couple to Galpha16. In HEK-293 cells, however, the MCP-1 receptors and C-CR1 coupled to Galphaq but failed to couple to Galpha16. In contrast, the interleukin-8 and C5a receptors did not couple to Galphaq in either COS-7 or HEK-293 cells but did couple to Galpha16.

Ganglioside (GM1) modulation of CD4 off the surface of T lymphocytes defined functions of the CD4 molecule during signal transduction through the T cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex. Antibody cross-linking of CD3 alone (3 x 3) stimulated phospholipase C (PLC) activity, rapid Ca2+ flux, and protein phosphorylations in freshly isolated human T lymphocytes. Antibody cross-linking of CD4 and CD3 (3 x 4) stimulated greater signaling than that caused by 3 x 3. Cross-linking CD4 alone did not stimulate these signaling processes. GM1-modulation of CD4 from the cell surface blocked all aspects of the augmented signaling imparted by CD4 co-modulation with CD3. In comparison, pretreatment with the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein inhibited 3 x 4-stimulated PLC activity and protein phosphorylation but not Ca2+ flux.

Acromegaly is associated with cardiac hypertrophy, which is believed to be a direct consequence of chronically elevated GH and IGF1. Given that insulin is important for cardiac growth and function, and considering that GH excess induces hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and cardiac alterations, it is of interest to study insulin sensitivity in this tissue under chronic conditions of elevated GH. Transgenic mice overexpressing GH present cardiomegaly and perivascular and interstitial fibrosis in the heart. Mice received an insulin injection, the heart was removed after 2 min, and immunoblotting assays of tissue extracts were performed to evaluate the activation and abundance of insulin-signaling mediators. Insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR) was conserved in transgenic mice, but the phosphorylation of IR substrate 1 (IRS1), its association with the regulatory subunit of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and the phosphorylation of AKT were decreased. In addition, total content of the glucose transporter GLUT4 was reduced in transgenic mice. Insulin failed to induce the phosphorylation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). However, transgenic mice displayed increased basal activation of the IR/IRS1/PI3K/AKT/mTOR and p38 signaling pathways along with higher serine phosphorylation of IRS1, which is recognized as an inhibitory modification.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Accumulating experimental evidence in mammalian, and recently plant, systems has led to a change in our understanding of the role played by hydrogen sulfide in life processes. In plants, hydrogen sulfide mitigates stress and regulates important plant processes such as photosynthesis, stomatal movement, and autophagy, although the underlying mechanism is not well known. In this study, we provide new experimental evidence that, together with our previous findings, demonstrates the role of hydrogen sulfide in regulating autophagy. We used green fluorescent protein fluorescence associated with autophagic bodies and immunoblot analysis of the ATG8 protein to show that sulfide (and no other molecules such as sulfur-containing molecules or ammonium) was able to inhibit the autophagy induced in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) roots under nitrogen deprivation. Our results showed that sulfide was unable to scavenge reactive oxygen species generated by nitrogen limitation, in contrast to well-established reducers. In addition, reducers were unable to inhibit the accumulation of autophagic bodies and ATG8 protein forms to the same extent as sulfide.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Smoking marijuana or administration of its main active constituent, delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta9-THC), may exert potent dilating effects on human airways. But the physiological significance of this observation and its potential therapeutic value are obscured by the fact that some asthmatic patients respond to these compounds with a paradoxical bronchospasm. The mechanisms underlying these contrasting responses remain unresolved. Here we show that the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide exerts dual effects on bronchial responsiveness in rodents: it strongly inhibits bronchospasm and cough evoked by the chemical irritant, capsaicin, but causes bronchospasm when the constricting tone exerted by the vagus nerve is removed. Both effects are mediated through peripheral CB1 cannabinoid receptors found on axon terminals of airway nerves. Biochemical analyses indicate that anandamide is synthesized in lung tissue on calcium-ion stimulation, suggesting that locally generated anandamide participates in the intrinsic control of airway responsiveness.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in neoplastic cells is often mediated by expression of P-glycoprotein, which functions as a drug-efflux pump for a broad range of substrates. We have used a combination of patch clamp and video-imaging techniques to examine the expression and drug-efflux function of P-glycoprotein and to determine the possible correlation with swelling-activated chloride channels in drug-sensitive and -resistant cell lines. Two pairs of cell lines were used in these experiments: (a) control NIH-3T3 cells and a corresponding MDR1-transfectant; and (b) control 8226 myeloma cells and a derivative cell line selected for resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Control cells lacked detectable P-glycoprotein expression based on Western blotting, immunofluorescence staining with a specific monoclonal antibody, and a functional assay of rhodamine-123 (R123) efflux. Resistant cells expressed P-glycoprotein at high levels and rapidly exported R123. During whole-cell recording using either hyperosmotic pipette solution or hypoosmotic Ringer solution, cell swelling was accompanied by Cl- channel opening in all four cell lines. The rates of induction, biophysical properties and magnitudes of Cl conductance (gCl) were indistinguishable between control and corresponding multidrug-resistant cells: gCl reached 0.96 +/- 0.31 (n = 14) and 0.83 +/- 0.31 nS/pF (mean +/- SD; n = 31) in NIH-3T3 and NIH-3T3/MDR cells, respectively; and 0.31 +/- 0.20 (n = 9) and 0.37 +/- 0.22 nS/pF (n = 7) in 8226 and 8226/Dox40 cells, respectively. gCl exhibited moderate outward rectification in symmetrical Cl- solutions, with a rectification ratio of 1.4 at +/- 50 mV.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Reduced HDL (high-density lipoprotein) concentration in the MetS (metabolic syndrome) is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and is related to defects in HDL-apoA-II (apolipoprotein A-II) kinetics.

In the present study, we examined the effect of weight loss on HDL-apoA-II kinetics in men with the MetS at the start and end of a 16-week intervention trial of a hypocaloric low-fat diet (n=20) compared with a weight maintenance diet (n=15), using a stable isotope technique and compartmental modelling. The low-fat diet achieved a significant reduction (P0.01) in BMI (body mass index), abdominal fat compartments and HOMA (homoeostasis model assessment) score compared with weight maintenance. Weight loss also significantly (P0.05) decreased both the production rate (-23%) and FCR (fractional catabolic rate) (-12%) of HDL-apoA-II, accounting for a net decrease in apoA-II concentration (-9%). Reductions in the HDL-apoA-II production rate were significantly associated with changes in body weight (r=0.683, P0.01), plasma triacylglycerols (triglycerides) (r=0.607, P0.01) and, to a lesser extent, plasma insulin (r=0.440, P=0.059) and HOMA-IR (HOMA of insulin resistance) (r=0.425, P=0.069).

We reported recently that the neuropeptides vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) protect CD4+ T cells against Ag-induced apoptosis by down-regulating the expression of Fas ligand (FasL). Because the cytotoxic activity of CD8+ CTLs is mediated through two mechanisms, which involve the perforin/granzyme and the FasL/Fas pathways, in this study we investigated the effects of VIP/PACAP on the generation and activity of allogeneic CTLs, of CD8+ T1 and T2 effector cells and of alloreactive peritoneal exudate cytotoxic T cells (PEL) generated in vivo. VIP/PACAP did not affect perforin/granzyme-mediated cytotoxicity, perforin gene expression, or granzyme B enzymatic activity, but drastically inhibited FasL/Fas-mediated cytotoxicity against allogeneic or syngeneic Fas-bearing targets. VIP/PACAP inhibit CTL generation, but not the activity of competent CTLs. The inhibition is associated with a profound down-regulation of FasL expression, and these effects are mediated through both VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors. VIP/PACAP inhibit the FasL/Fas-mediated cytotoxicity of T1 effectors and do not affect T2 cytotoxicity, which is entirely perforin/granzyme mediated. Similar effects were observed in vivo.

The anaerobic bacterium Propionigenium modestum gains its total energy for growth from the conversion of succinate to propionate according to: succinate + H(2)O --> propionate + HCO(3) ( big up tri, openG' = -20.6 kJ/mol). The small free energy change of this reaction does not allow a substrate-linked phosphorylation mechanism, and no electron transport phosphorylation takes place. Succinate was degraded by cell-free extracts to propionate and CO(2) via succinyl-CoA, methyl-malonyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA. This pathway involves a membrane-bound methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase which couples the exergonic decarboxylation with a Na ion transport across the membrane. The organism also contained a membrane-bound ATPase which was specifically activated by Na ions and catalyzed and transport of Na ions into inverted bacterial vesicles upon ATP hydrolysis. The transport was abolished by monensin but not by the uncoupler carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxy phenylhydrazone. Isolated membrane vesicles catalyzed the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate when malonyl-CoA was decarboxylated and malonyl-CoA synthesis from acetyl-CoA when ATP was hydrolyzed. These syntheses were sensitive to monensin which indicates that Na functions as the coupling ion.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Tauroursodeoxycholic acid ( TUDCA ), an endogenous bile acid, modulates cell death by interrupting classic pathways of apoptosis. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating acute neurological disorder, without effective treatment, in which a significant loss of neuronal cells is thought to occur by apoptosis. In this study, we evaluated whether TUDCA can reduce brain injury and improve neurological function after ICH in rats. Administration of TUDCA before or up to 6 h after stereotaxic collagenase injection into the striatum reduced lesion volumes at 2 days by as much as 50%. Apoptosis was approximately 50% decreased in the area immediately surrounding the hematoma and was associated with a similar inhibition of caspase activity. These changes were also associated with improved neurobehavioral deficits as assessed by rotational asymmetry, limb placement, and stepping ability. Furthermore, TUDCA treatment modulated expression of certain Bcl-2 family members, as well as NF-kappaB activity. In addition to its protective action at the mitochondrial membrane, TUDCA also activated the Akt-1protein kinase Balpha survival pathway and induced Bad phosphorylation at Ser-136.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Staphylococcus aureus community-acquired pneumonia is often associated with influenza or an influenza-like syndrome. Morbidity and mortality due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or influenza and pneumonia, which includes bacterial co- infection, are among the top causes of death by infectious diseases in the United States. We developed a non-lethal influenza A virus (IAV) (H3N2)/S. aureus co- infection model in cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) to test the hypothesis that seasonal IAV infection predisposes non-human primates to severe S. aureus pneumonia. Infection and disease progression were monitored by clinical assessment of animal health; analysis of blood chemistry, nasal swabs, and X-rays; and gross pathology and histopathology of lungs from infected animals. Seasonal IAV infection in healthy cynomolgus macaques caused mild pneumonia, but unexpectedly, did not predispose these animals to subsequent severe infection with the community-associated MRSA clone USA300.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Cell surface CD147 shows remarkable variations in size (31-65 kDa) because of heterogeneous N-glycosylation, with the most highly glycosylated forms functioning to induce matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) production. Here we show that all three CD147 N-glycosylation sites make similar contributions to both high and low glycoforms (HG- and LG-CD147). l-Phytohemagglutinin lectin binding and swainsonine inhibition experiments indicated that HG-CD147 contains N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V-catalyzed, beta1,6-branched, polylactosamine-type sugars, which account for its excess size. Therefore, CD147, which is itself elevated on invasive tumor cells, may make a major contribution to the abundance of beta1,6-branched polylactosamine sugars that appear on invasive tumor cells. It was shown previously that caveolin-1 associates with CD147, thus inhibiting CD147 self-aggregation and MMP induction; now we show that caveolin-1 associates with LG-CD147 and restricts the biosynthetic conversion of LG-CD147 to HG-CD147. In addition, HG-CD147 (but not LG-CD147) was preferentially captured as a multimer after treatment of cells with a homobifunctional cross-linking agent and was exclusively recognized by monoclonal antibody AAA6, a reagent that selectively recognizes self-associated CD147 and inhibits CD147-mediated MMP induction.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Leptin and insulin share some hypothalamic signaling molecules, but their central administration induces different effects on hepatic glucose fluxes. Acute insulin infusion in the third cerebral ventricle inhibits endogenous glucose production ( GP ), whereas acute leptin infusion stimulates gluconeogenesis but does not alter GP because of a compensatory decrease in glycogenolysis. Because melanocortin agonists also stimulate hepatic gluconeogenesis, here we examined whether central melanocortin blockade modifies the acute effects of leptin on GP, on gluconeogenesis, on glycogenolysis, and/or on the hepatic expression of the gluconeogenic enzymes glucose-6-phosphatase (Glc-6-Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). Systemic or central administration of leptin alone did not alter GP, despite increasing both the rate of gluconeogenesis and the expression of Glc-6-Pase and PEPCK. When activation of the central melanocortin pathway was prevented, the effects of leptin on gluconeogenesis, Glc-6-Pase, and PEPCK were abolished, and a marked suppression of glycogenolysis resulted in decreased GP.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The bone marrow microenvironment is physiologically hypoxic with areas being as low as 1% O2, e.g. the stem cell niche. Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) blasts misuse these bone marrow niches for protection by the local microenvironment, but also might create their own microenvironment. Here we identify IL-8 as a hypoxia -regulated cytokine in both AML cell lines and primary AML samples that is induced within 48 hours of severe hypoxia (1% O2). IL-8 lacked effects on AML cells but induced migration in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), an integral part of the bone marrow. Accordingly, MSC were significantly increased in AML bone marrow as compared to healthy bone marrow. Interestingly, mononuclear cells obtained from healthy bone marrow displayed both significantly lower endogenous and hypoxia -induced production of IL-8. IL-8 mRNA expression in AML blasts from 533 patients differed between genetic subgroups with significantly lower expression of IL-8 in acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), while in non APL-AML patients with FLT ITD had the highest IL-8 expression. In this subgroup, high IL-8 expression was also prognostically unfavourable.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Collagen triple helix repeat containing-1 ( Cthrc1 ) is a documented specific inhibitor of TGF- signaling. Based on this observation, we developed the hypothesis that knocking in/knocking out the Cthrc1 gene in murine models of cholestasis would alter the natural history of cholestatic fibrosis. To study this thesis, we studied two murine models of fibrosis, first, common bile duct ligation (CBDL) and second, feeding of 3, 5-diethoxy-carbonyl-1, 4-dihydrocollidine (DDC). In both models, we administered well-defined adenoviral vectors that expressed either Cthrc1 or, alternatively, a short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-targeting Cthrc1 either before or after establishment of fibrosis. Importantly, when Cthrc1 gene expression was enhanced, we noted a significant improvement of hepatic fibrosis, both microscopically and by analysis of fibrotic gene expression. In contrast, when Cthrc1 gene expression was deleted, there was a significant exacerbation of fibrosis. To identify the mechanism of action of these significant effects produced by knocking in/knocking out Cthrc gene expression, we thence studied the interaction of Cthrc1 gene expression using hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and human LX-2 cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that Cthrc1 is induced by TGF-1 via phospho-Smad3 binding to the promoter with subsequent transcription activation. In addition, we demonstrate that Cthrc1 inhibits TGF- signaling by accelerating degradation of phospho-Smad3 through a proteosomal pathway. Importantly, the anti-fibrotic effects can be recapitulated with a truncated fragment of Cthrc1.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

To increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I influence bovine mammary gland development, the potential roles of T-box2 (TBX2) and T-box3 (TBX3) were investigated. Although no information regarding expression of either transcription factor in the bovine mammary gland exists, it is known that TBX3 and its closely related family member, TBX2, are required for mammary gland development in humans and mice. Additionally, TBX3 mutations in humans and mice lead to ulnar mammary syndrome. Evidence is present in bone that TBX3 is required for proliferation and its expression is regulated by GH, an important regulator of mammary gland development and milk production. We hypothesized that TBX2 and TBX3 are expressed in the bovine mammary gland and that GH, IGF-I, or both increase TBX2 and TBX3 expression in bovine mammary epithelial cells (MEC). Bovine mammary gland tissue, MAC-T cells, primary MEC, and fibroblasts were obtained and TBX2 and TBX3 expression was determined by real-time reverse transcription PCR. In addition, TBX2 and TBX3 expression was examined in cells treated with 100 or 500 ng/mL of GH or 100 or 200 ng/mL of IGF-I for 24 or 48 h. Both TBX2 and TBX3 were expressed in bovine mammary tissue. Surprisingly, expression of TBX2 was only detected in mammary fibroblast cells, whereas TBX3 was expressed in all 3 cell types. Growth hormone did not alter TBX3 expression in MAC-T cells or MEC. However, IGF-I increased TBX3 expression in MAC-T, but not in primary MEC. We did not observe a change in TBX2 or TBX3 expression in fibroblasts treated with GH and IGF.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Mouse mast cell protease 4 ( mMCP-4 ), the mouse counterpart of human mast cell chymase, is thought to have proinflammatory effects in innate or adaptive immune responses associated with mast cell activation. However, human chymase can degrade the proinflammatory cytokine TNF, a mediator that can be produced by mast cells and many other cell types. We found that mMCP-4 can reduce levels of mouse mast cell-derived TNF in vitro through degradation of transmembrane and soluble TNF. We assessed the effects of interactions between mMCP-4 and TNF in vivo by analyzing the features of a classic model of polymicrobial sepsis, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), in C57BL/6J- mMCP-4 -deficient mice versus C57BL/6J wild-type mice, and in C57BL/6J-Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice containing adoptively transferred mast cells that were either wild type or lacked mMCP-4, TNF, or both mediators.

Exposure of neutrophils to LPS (lipopolysaccharide) triggers their oxidative response. However, the relationship between the signalling downstream of TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) after LPS stimulation and the activation of the oxidase remains elusive. Phosphorylation of the cytosolic factor p47phox is essential for activation of the NADPH oxidase. In the present study, we examined the hypothesis that IRAK-4 (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-4), the main regulatory kinase downstream of TLR4 activation, regulates the NADPH oxidase through phosphorylation of p47phox. We show that p47phox is a substrate for IRAK-4. Unlike PKC (protein kinase C), IRAK-4 phosphorylates p47phox not only at serine residues, but also at threonine residues. Target residues were identified by tandem MS, revealing a novel threonine-rich regulatory domain. We also show that p47phox is phosphorylated in granulocytes in response to LPS stimulation. LPS-dependent phosphorylation of p47phox was enhanced by the inhibition of p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), confirming that the kinase operates upstream of p38 MAPK. IRAK-4 -phosphorylated p47phox activated the NADPH oxidase in a cell-free system, and IRAK-4 overexpression increased NADPH oxidase activity in response to LPS. We have shown that endogenous IRAK-4 interacts with p47phox and they co-localize at the plasma membrane after LPS stimulation, using immunoprecipitation assays and immunofluorescence microscopy respectively. IRAK-4 was activated in neutrophils in response to LPS stimulation.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Medicinal plant compounds are potential candidates for EmrD-3 efflux pump modulation. The antibacterial activities of garlic Allium sativum, although poorly understood, predicts that a main bioactive component, allyl sulfide, modulates EmrD-3 efflux. Thus, we tested whether A. sativum extract acts in synergy with antimicrobials and that a main bioactive component allyl sulfide inhibits EmrD-3 efflux.

Numerous compounds for treating human disease have been discovered in nature. Manumycin-A ( Man-A ) is a natural, well-tolerated microbial metabolite and a potent experimental tumoricide. We recently showed that Man-A stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) which were upstream of serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) dephosphorylation and caspase-dependent cleavage of MEK and Akt in lymphoma apoptosis. Conversely, activation-specific, Ser/Thr phosphorylation of MEK and Akt proteins was stable in Man-A -resistant tumors suggesting that stimulation of Ser/Thr PPase activity might be required for Man-A tumoricidal activity. Pre-treatment with Calyculin-A, an equipotent inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A, blocked all downstream effects of Man-A whereas, the PP2A-selective inhibitor, Okadaic acid did not, suggesting that PP1 and not PP2A played a role in Man-A action. Phosphorylation of PP1 on Thr320 inhibits its activity. Hence, we posited that if PP1 was important for Man-A action, then Man-A treatment should promote dephosphorylation of PP1 on Thr320. Indeed, T320 was only dephosphorylated in the tumors that underwent apoptosis. Lastly, stable over-expression of a constitutively active PP1 mimetic (PP1T320A mutant), elevated basal ROS levels and enhanced Man-A -stimulated apoptosis.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Renal mesangial cells play an important role in the development of diabetic kidney disease. We have previously demonstrated that some of the effects of high glucose on mesangial extracellular matrix (ECM) protein expression are mediated by the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway ( HBP ) in which fructose-6-phosphate is converted to glucosamine-6-phosphate by the rate-limiting enzyme glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT). Using Affymetrix murine expression U430 2.0 oligochips, we examined the global effects of high glucose (HG) and glucosamine (GlcN) on mRNA expression of a mouse mesangial cell line (MES-13). We sought to determine the portion of mRNA expression in MES-13 cells, which is mediated both by high glucose and glucosamine, i.e., via the HBP. Of the 34,000 genes on the chip, approximately 55.7 - 60.8% genes are detected in MES-13 cells. Culturing MES-13 cells for 48 h with HG alters the expression of approximately 389 genes at our preset threshold levels (at least 2-fold change) where 263 genes are up-regulated and 126 genes are down-regulated. GlcN also increases the expression of 106 genes and decreases 94 genes during the same period of incubation.

1. Acute liver injury is a severe disease in which metabolic homeostasis is affected. The presence of liver cell death triggers a cascade of inflammatory responses leading to various degrees of liver damage. The pathophysiology of liver injury is complex, involving an interplay between parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells. 2. There is increasing evidence for a role of the local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in liver cell death, inflammatory response and liver regeneration. It has been shown that the local RAS plays an important regulatory role in a variety of tissues. In experimental hepatic fibrogenesis, the angiotensin AT(1) receptor (AT(1)R) blocker losartan has been shown to be able to attenuate transforming growth factor-b1 activity and collagen gene expression. 3.

H (24 h at 1% O2)/R (5 min) caused an increase in intracellular ROS production compared to a normoxic control, as measured by dichlorofluorescin fluorescence. Nutrient deprivation ( ND ; 24 h), a component of H, was sufficient to induce a similar increase in ROS under normoxia. Either H(24 h)/R (2 h) or ND (24 h) induced increases in lipid peroxidation of similar magnitude as measured by flow cytometry of diphenyl-1-pyrenylphosphine-loaded HUVECs and Western blotting analysis of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-modified proteins in cell lysates. In cells infected with a control adenovirus, H (24 h)/R (2 h) and ND (24 h) resulted in increases in NADPH-dependent superoxide production by 5- and 9-fold, respectively, as measured by lucigenin chemiluminescence. Infection of HUVECs with an adenovirus that encodes the dominant-negative allele of Rac1 (Rac1N17) abolished these increases. Rac1N17 expression also suppressed the H/R- and ND -induced increases in lipid peroxidation.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The results concerning the action of Ketotifen "in vitro" on the adherence, spontaneous and chemotactic mobility and phagocytosis of neutrophil polymorphonuclear cells ( PMN s) of the non-specific immunological system are presented. PMN cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 degrees C prior to the evaluation of different functions, with the following concentrations of Ketotifen: 1, 10 and 100 ng, and 1 and 10 micrograms/ml., final concentration. PMN cell adherence to glass spheres was unaffected by doses of the drug considered to have pharmacological action; however, a statistically significant enhancement was observed in this function from a concentration of 10 ng./ml. onwards. Mobility, both spontaneous and chemotactic was inhibited in the presence of Ketotifen only at high doses; the chemotactic function was more susceptible to the action of the drug at doses of 10 ng./ml. than spontaneous mobility, which required ten-fold greater concentrations for inhibition to take place. Likewise, the phagocytosis of C. albicans was inhibited by the presence of the drug at doses of 10 ng./ml. and higher.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
In conclusion, Ketotifen in <el> PMN <le> cells at pharmacological doses only induces a slight increase in adherence and a decrease in the functions of mobility and <re> phagocytosis <er> of C. albicans; at least "in vitro", much higher concentrations, which are not found with the doses usually employed, are required for these functions to be altered significantly. negative----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

First incubating dispersed acini from rat pancreas with monensin, a cation ionophore that can inhibit recycling of receptors, inhibited binding of 125I-cholecystokinin 8 (125I- CCK -8) measured during a second incubation by as much as 50%. A maximal effect of monensin required 90 min of first incubation. Detectable inhibition of binding of 125I- CCK -8 occurred with 300 nM monensin, and inhibition increased progressively with concentrations of monensin up to 25 microM. Pancreatic acini possess two classes of receptors that bind 125I- CCK -8. One class has a high affinity (Kd = 461 pM) and a low capacity for CCK (512 fmol/mg DNA); the other class has a low affinity (Kd = 47 nM) and a high capacity for CCK (18 pmol/mg DNA). First incubating acini with monensin caused an 84% decrease in the number of high affinity CCK receptors with no change in the number of low affinity CCK receptors or the values of Kd for either class of receptors indicating that there is recycling of high affinity CCK receptors but not low affinity CCK receptors.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Corticotropin-releasing factor ( CRF ) and dopamine ( DA ) are important integrators of the endocrine and autonomic response to stress. CRF neurons in the anterior portions of the periventricular nucleus (PV) and parvocellular paraventricular nucleus (pvPVN) occur close to A14 DA neurons in these same locations. Since CRF has been shown to act as an excitatory neurotransmitter, possible CRF interactions with the DA system were investigated using double-label immunocytochemistry. Coronal vibratome sections through the PV and pvPVN were obtained from colchicine-treated and nontreated juvenile female cynomolgus macaques. They were sequentially immunostained for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (to identify DA neurons) with PAP and DA B, and for CRF using 15 nm colloidal gold. By light microscopy, areas of coincidence of TH- and CRF -immunoreactive cell bodies in the PV and pvPVN were obvious, but double-stained elements were not observed. By electron microscopy, asymmetrical synapses frequently occurred between CRF axons and TH dendrites or somata. Symmetrical axosomatic synapses sometimes appeared adjacent to these CRF /TH synapses, while symmetrical axoaxonic synapses were rare.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

There is growing evidence that insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF-1 ) and parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) have synergistic actions on bone and that part of the anabolic effects of PTH is mediated by local production of IGF-1. In this study we analyzed the skeletal response to PTH in mouse models with manipulated endocrine or autocrine/paracrine IGF-1. We used mice carrying a hepatic IGF-1 transgene (HIT), which results in a threefold increase in serum IGF-1 levels and normal tissue IGF-1 expression, and Igf1 null mice with blunted IGF-1 expression in tissues but threefold increases in serum IGF-1 levels (KO-HIT). Evaluation of skeletal growth showed that elevations in serum IGF-1 in mice with Igf1 gene ablation in all tissues except the liver (KO-HIT) resulted in a restoration of skeletal morphology and mechanical properties by adulthood. Intermittent PTH treatment of adult HIT mice resulted in increases in serum osteocalcin levels, femoral total cross-sectional area, cortical bone area and cortical bone thickness, as well as bone mechanical properties. We found that the skeletal response of HIT mice to PTH was significantly higher than that of control mice, suggesting synergy between IGF-1 and PTH on bone. In sharp contrast, although PTH -treated KO-HIT mice demonstrated an anabolic response in cortical and trabecular bone compartments compared with vehicle-treated KO-HIT mice, their response was identical to that of PTH -treated control mice.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

cis-Diamminedichloroplatinum II ( CDDP ) is an antineoplastic drug against solid malignant tumors. However, its clinical use is limited by nephrotoxicity. CDDP also causes hypokalemia and in vivo microperfusion method have demonstrated that luminal CDDP increases K+ secretion by hyperpolarization of the transepithelial voltage difference through stimulating Na+ transport in the distal segments. However, there is no direct evidence for this mechanism. We therefore examined the effect of luminal CDDP on Na+ and K+ transport in the rabbit cortical collecting duct (CCD) using in vitro isolated tubular microperfusion. Luminal CDDP hyperpolarized the transepithelial voltage difference (V(T)) in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations from 10(-5) M to 10(-3) M and at 10(-3) M CDDP, V(T) was hyperpolarized from -11.6+/-2.3 mV to -16.6+/-3.3 mV (P0.001). A concentration of 10(-5) M ouabain, 10(-4) M amiloride and 2 mM BaCl2 all completely abolished CDDP -induced hyperpolarization. To confirm the mechanism, Na+ and K+ flux were measured in the presence of 10(-3) M CDDP. CDDP decreased net K+ secretion from -22.2+/-5.7 to -15.2+/-2.9 pmol mm(-1) min(-1) (P0.01) without any effect on the lumen-to-bath isotope flux of Na+ (52.6+/-10.6 to 52.1+/-10.7 pmol mm(-1) min(-1)). These data suggest that luminal CDDP hyperpolarizes V(T) primarily by inhibiting K+ conductance but did not influence Na+ transport of the luminal membrane.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Recent studies have suggested that insulin action is reduced during puberty in normal children. To determine whether such resistance leads to excessive insulin secretion, we used the hyperglycemic clamp technique to produce a standard hyperglycemic stimulus (125 mg/dl above fasting levels for 120 minutes) in 9 preadolescent and 14 adolescent healthy children and in 14 normal adults. Fasting plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations were higher in adolescents than in preadolescents and adults (p less than or equal to 0.02). Despite identical glucose increments during the glucose clamp procedure, both first- and second-phase plasma insulin and C-peptide responses were also markedly greater in adolescents than in preadolescents or adults (p less than 0.01 vs. other groups). Despite sharply increased insulin responses in adolescents, the amount of exogenous glucose required to maintain hyperglycemia was similar in all three groups. Insulin responses in the children were directly correlated with fasting plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor I (r = 0.60 to 0.70, p less than 0.01).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Human CYP3A enzymes play a pivotal role in the metabolism of many drugs, and the variability of their expression among individuals may have a strong impact on the efficacy of drug treatment. However, the individual contributions of the four CYP3A genes to total CYP3A activity remain unclear. To elucidate the role of CYP3A7, we have studied its expression in human liver and intestine. In both organs, expression of CYP3A7 mRNA was polymorphic. The recently identified CYP3A7*1C allele was a consistent marker of increased CYP3A7 expression both in liver and intestine, whereas the CYP3A7*1B allele was associated with increased CYP3A7 expression only in liver. Because of the replacement of part of the CYP3A7 promoter by the corresponding region of CYP3A4, the CYP3A7*1C allele contains the proximal ER6 motif of CYP3A4. The pregnane X and constitutively activated receptors were shown to bind with higher affinity to CYP3A4-ER6 than to CYP3A7- ER6 motif s and transactivated only promoter constructs containing CYP3A4-ER6. Furthermore, we identified mutations in CYP3A7*1C in addition to the ER6 motif that were necessary only for activation by the constitutively activated receptor.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We have previously shown a causal role of peroxynitrite in mediating retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death in diabetic and neurotoxicity models. In the present study, the role of peroxynitrite in altering the antioxidant and antiapoptotic thioredoxin ( Trx ) system will be investigated as well as the subsequent effects on glial activation and capillary degeneration. Excitotoxicity of the retina was induced by intravitreal injection of N-methyl-d-aspartate ( NMDA ) in rats, which also received the peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst FeTPPs. RGC loss was assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling and GC count. Glial activation and nitrotyrosine were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Acellular capillaries and pericytes were counted in retinal trypsin digest. NMDA -induced peroxynitrite formation caused RGC loss, which was associated with enhanced expression of Trx and its endogenous inhibitor thioredoxin interacting protein. The results also showed enhanced thioredoxin interacting protein/ Trx binding and disruption of the Trx /apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 "inhibitory complex," leading to release of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 and activation of the apoptotic pathway, as evidenced by p38 MAPK and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase activation. Furthermore, NMDA caused glial activation and compromised retinal vasculature, as indicated by acellular-capillary formation and pericyte loss.

We previously showed that augmented levels of endogenous angiotensin II ( AngII ) contribute to vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) hypertrophy through the transactivation of growth factor receptors in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Resveratrol (RV), a polyphenolic component of red wine, has also been shown to attenuate AngII -evoked VSMC hypertrophy ; however, the molecular mechanism mediating this response is obscure. The present study was therefore undertaken to examine whether RV could prevent AngII -induced VSMC hypertrophy through the transactivation of growth factor receptor and associated signaling pathways. AngII treatment of VSMC enhanced the protein synthesis that was attenuated towards control levels by RV pretreatment as well as by the inhibitors of NADPH oxidase, c-Src, and growth factor receptors. Furthermore, RV pretreatment also inhibited enhanced levels of superoxide anion, NADPH oxidase activity, increased expression of NADPH oxidase subunits, and phosphorylation of c-Src, EGF-R, PDGE-R, ERK1/2, and AKT1/2.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The results were compared with those obtained by a commercially available assay, the HerpeSelect 2 ELISA (the FOCUS2 assay). Five different panels of sera were analyzed: panel A consisted of 109 serum samples from patients with a culture-proven HSV-1 infection that were Western blotting (WB) negative for HSV-2; panel B consisted of 106 serum samples from patients with a culture-proven recurrent HSV-2 infection that were WB positive for HSV-2; panel C consisted of 100 serum samples with no detectable IgG antibodies against HSV-1 and HSV-2; panel D consisted of 70 HSV-2 negative "tricky" serum samples containing antinuclear IgG antibodies or IgM antibodies against other viruses or bacteria; and panel E consisted of consecutive serum samples from 21 patients presenting with a first episode of HSV-2-induced lesions.

Growth hormone (GH) is of importance for normal bone remodelling. A recent clinical study demonstrated that MK-677, a member of a class of GH secretagogues (GHSs), increases serum concentrations of biochemical markers of bone formation and bone resorption. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the GHSs, ipamorelin (IPA) and GH-releasing peptide-6 ( GHRP-6 ), increase bone mineral content ( BMC ) in young adult female rats. Thirteen-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were given IPA (0.5 mg/kg per day; n=7), GHRP-6 (0.5 mg/kg per day; n=8), GH (3.5 mg/kg per day; n=7), or vehicle administered continuously s.c. via osmotic minipumps for 12 weeks. The animals were followed in vivo by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements every 4th week. After the animals were killed, femurs were analysed in vitro by mid-diaphyseal peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) scans. After this, excised femurs and vertebrae L6 were analysed by the use of Archimedes' principle and by determinations of ash weights. All treatments increased body weight and total tibial and vertebral BMC measured by DXA in vivo compared with vehicle-treated controls. However, total BMC corrected for the increase in body weight (total BMC :body weight ratio) was unaffected. Tibial area bone mineral density (BMD, BMC /area) was increased, but total and vertebral area BMDs were unchanged. The pQCT measurements in vitro revealed that the increase in the cortical BMC was due to an increased cross-sectional bone area, whereas the cortical volumetric BMD was unchanged.

The c-myc oncogene encodes for a transcriptional factor involved in many cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. According to these different functions, the role of c-Myc protein in cellular sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs is controversial.

Analysis of VLB cytotoxicity demonstrated a 3-fold increase in VLB sensitivity in LoVo-mycANS cells. Comparison between cells revealed different apoptosis kinetics: accumulation of cells in sub-G1 phase and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage occurred earlier in LoVo-mycANS.

Murine mammary tumor cells with differential vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) expression were used to study the mechanisms of growth inhibition by vitamin D steroids. In VDR -expressing WT145 cells, 1,25D and its synthetic analog EB1089 induce growth arrest and transcriptionally upregulate the well-characterized VDR target gene CYP24. 1,25D also induces apoptosis in WT145 cells through activation of initiator and executioner caspases and the calcium-dependent protease calpain. We also demonstrate that WT145 cells express CYP27B1, the enzyme that converts 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) (25D) to 1,25D, and that 25D inhibits growth of these cells but does not trigger apoptosis or induce CYP24 expression.

The goal of this study was to compare the reproductive physiology of triploid and diploid European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.). Gonads of diploid and triploid fish (males and females) were examined both microscopically and macroscopically, together with the plasma levels of the major sex steroids produced (testosterone and estradiol-17beta) when fish were adults. Prior to sexual maturation, the gonadosomatic index (GSI) of triploid males was similar to that of diploids. However, the GSI in 4-year-old adult triploid males was 1.8 times lower than that of diploids (P  0.05). All diploid males exhibited normal gonadal development. In contrast, in triploid males spermatogenesis was impaired during late meiosis, affecting severely spermiogenesis. This was achieved by an increasing imbalance in the amount of DNA present in daughter cells of the same type as spermatogenesis progressed, as demonstrated by abnormal cell sizes, culminating in inviable spermatids. Thus, no spermiating triploid fish were observed during 4 years, which included three full consecutive maturation cycles. Furthermore, the germ cells from triploids were significantly larger than those from diploids (P  0.001). Seasonal profiles of plasma levels of testosterone in 4-year-old males were essentially similar in both ploidies. On the other hand, triploid females had rudimentary ovaries containing oogonia and primary oocytes that were arrested during meiotic prophase I, while diploid females exhibited all stages of ovarian development. Diploid females showed levels of testosterone and estradiol-17beta significantly higher than those of triploids (P  0.05), in which no endocrine signs of maturation were observed at all.

PEROXIN11 ( PEX11 ) is a peroxisomal membrane protein in fungi and mammals and was proposed to play a major role in peroxisome proliferation. To begin understanding how peroxisomes proliferate in plants and how changes in peroxisome abundance affect plant development, we characterized the extended Arabidopsis thaliana PEX11 protein family, consisting of the three phylogenetically distinct subfamilies PEX11 a, PEX11 b, and PEX11 c to PEX11 e. All five Arabidopsis PEX11 proteins target to peroxisomes, as demonstrated for endogenous and cyan fluorescent protein fusion proteins by fluorescence microscopy and immunobiochemical analysis using highly purified leaf peroxisomes. PEX11 a and PEX11 c to PEX11 e behave as integral proteins of the peroxisome membrane. Overexpression of At PEX11 genes in Arabidopsis induced peroxisome proliferation, whereas reduction in gene expression decreased peroxisome abundance. PEX11 c and PEX11 e, but not PEX11 a, PEX11 b, and PEX11 d, complemented to significant degrees the growth phenotype of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae pex11 null mutant on oleic acid. Heterologous expression of PEX11 e in the yeast mutant increased the number and reduced the size of the peroxisomes.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Small-molecule inhibitors of protein kinases have contributed immensely to our understanding of biological signaling pathways and have been exploited therapeutically for the treatment of cancers and other disease states. The pyridinyl imidazole compounds SB 203580 and SB 202190 were identified as ATP competitive antagonists of the p38 stress-activated protein kinases and have been widely used to elucidate p38-dependent cellular processes. Here, we identify SB 203580 and SB 202190 as potent inhibitors of stress-induced CREB phosphorylation on Serine 111 (Ser-111) in intact cells. Unexpectedly, we found that the inhibitory activity of SB 203580 and SB 202190 on CREB phosphorylation was independent of p38, but instead correlated with inhibition of casein kinase 1 ( CK1 ) in vitro.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain of the type II IL-1 decoy receptor ( IL-1RII ) generates soluble IL-1-binding proteins that prevent excessive bioactivity by binding free IL-1. In this study we report that an aminopeptidase, aminopeptidase regulator of TNFR1 shedding ( ARTS-1 ), is required for IL-1RII shedding. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate an association between endogenous membrane-associated ARTS-1 and a 47-kDa IL-1RII, consistent with ectodomain cleavage of the membrane-bound receptor. A direct correlation exists between ARTS-1 protein expression and IL-1RII shedding, as cell lines overexpressing ARTS-1 have increased IL-1RII shedding and decreased membrane-associated IL-1RII. Basal IL-1RII shedding is absent from ARTS-1 knockout cell lines, demonstrating that ARTS-1 is required for constitutive IL-1RII shedding. Similarly, PMA-mediated IL-1RII shedding is almost entirely ARTS-1 -dependent. ARTS-1 expression also enhances ionomycin-induced IL-1RII shedding. ARTS-1 did not alter levels of membrane-associated IL-1RI or IL-1R antagonist release from ARTS-1 cell lines, which suggests that the ability of ARTS-1 to promote shedding of IL-1R family members may be specific for IL-1RII. Further, increased IL-1RII shedding by ARTS-1 -overexpressing cells attenuates the biological activity of IL-1beta.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The adhesion of T lymphocytes to human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (DMVEC) in vitro has been tested after stimulation of the DMVEC with gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), interleukin 1 (IL-1), or a bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). These agents enhanced T-cell adhesion in a manner similar to that previously observed with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (UVEC). Moreover, phorbol ester stimulation of T cells enhanced T-cell adhesion to both DMVEC and UVEC. Unstimulated and phorbol ester-enhanced T-cell adhesion to both DMVEC and UVEC was strongly inhibited by monoclonal antibody (Mab) 60.3 against the surface membrane CDw18 glycoprotein complex. In contrast, Mab 60.3 had a much weaker inhibitory effect on the binding enhancement due to IL-1, LPS, or IFN-gamma, suggesting that these agents may enhance adhesion by a mechanism at least partially independent of CDw18.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

This study aimed to evaluate whether female adult offspring born with intrauterine growth retardation induced by prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE) are susceptible to osteoarthritis (OA) and to explore the underlying programming mechanisms. Pregnant rats were treated with nicotine or saline at 2.0 mg/kg/d from gestational d 11 to 20. The female adult offspring with or without PNE were forced with a strenuous treadmill running for 6 wk to induce OA. Nicotine's effects on fetal articular chondrocytes were studied by exposing chondrocytes to nicotine for 10 d, and dihydro--erythroidine, a selective 42-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) inhibitor, was used to identify the change of nicotine's effect. For adult offspring, increased cartilage destruction and accelerated OA progression were observed in the PNE group with running; the expression of 1 chain of type II collagen (Col2A1), aggrecan, SRY-type high mobility group box 9 (Sox9), and IGF1 signaling molecules in the cartilage of PNE offspring were decreased. For fetuses, elevated serum corticosteroid and nicotine levels and suppressed IGF1 levels were observed; expression of Col2A1, aggrecan, Sox9, and IGF1 were reduced. The result of chondrocytes revealed that nicotine impeded the expression of Col2A1, aggrecan, and IGF1 ; blocking 42-nAChR rescued nicotine's suppression.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Activation of the coagulation system by contact of circulating blood with tissue factor, a component of the extrinsic blood coagulation pathway that is produced in the vessel wall, may represent a pathway for the initiation of thrombosis in atherosclerotic vessels. This hypothesis was tested in vivo in a rabbit femoral artery eversion (inside-out) graft model, in which the adventitia, with its tissue factor, was exposed to circulating blood. Intra-arterial infusion of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against tissue factor (D3) at a rate of 12 mg/kg over 15 minutes prevented thrombosis of a 7-8-mm eversion graft within a 2-hour observation period in four of five rabbits, whereas with a control antibody infusion (MA-15C5), occlusion occurred within 2 hours in five of six rabbits. In vitro immersion before reinsertion of the arterial segment in a solution containing 2 mg/ml of the control antibody for 30 minutes was associated with occlusion in all six rabbits, whereas pretreatment with D3 was associated with persistent patency in three of nine rabbits. Stepwise logistic-regression analysis of the results with perfusion status as the dependent variable and type of antibody (D3 or MA-15C5), application method (infusion versus immersion), and graft segment length as independent variables yielded a significant difference in frequency of occlusion with the two antibodies (p = 0.016).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Rin1 is a Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange factor that plays an important role in Ras-activated endocytosis and growth factor receptor trafficking in fibroblasts. In this study, we show that Rin1 is expressed at high levels in a large number of non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, including Hop62, H650, HCC4006, HCC827, EKVX, HCC2935, and A549. Rin1 depletion from A549 cells resulted in a decrease in cell proliferation that was correlated to a decrease in epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) signaling. Expression of wild type Rin1 but not the Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange factor-deficient Rin1 (Rin1Delta) complemented the Rin1 depletion effects, and overexpression of Rin1Delta had a dominant negative effect on cell proliferation. Rin1 depletion stabilized the cell surface levels of EGFR, suggesting that internalization was necessary for robust signaling in A549 cells.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We found that HS1BP3 localized to the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum partially. Overexpression of HS1BP3 induced apoptosis in HEK293T and HeLa cell lines. When these cell lines were transfected with HS1BP3, they exhibited nuclear DNA condensation, externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS), and cleavage of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP).

To examine the role of altered vitamin D metabolism in reducing the renal excretion of calcium, we studied 11 patients with idiopathic hypercalciuria before and after 2 weeks of treatment with oral neutral orthophosphate (2 g phosphorus/day). Variables measured were urine calcium and phosphorus and seseserum calcium, phosphorus, immunoreactive parathyroid hormone, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D]. Oral phosphate treatment significantly decreased urine calcium excretion [mean change (delta), -123 mg/24 h], increased urine phosphorus (mean delta, serum levels of 1,25-(OH)2D (mean delta, -22 pg/ml). Pretreatment levels of 1,25-(OH)2D were high when compared with levels in age-matched controls, whether assessed as the arithmetic mean (57 vs. 33 pg/ml; P  0.025), the logarithmically normalized (42 vs. 27 pg/ml).

This was a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study with 5 single-dose treatment periods with a washout period of 2 weeks between doses. During each treatment period, a different dose of BIA 3-202 or placebo was administered concomitantly with Sinemet 25/100. Tolerability was assessed by recording adverse events, vital signs, continuous EKG, and clinical laboratory parameters. Pharmacokinetic parameters of levodopa and 3-O-methyl- levodopa (3-OMD) were determined. The activity of soluble COMT in erythrocytes was also measured. Eighteen subjects (10 men and 8 women) participated in the study. The drug combination was well tolerated, with the adverse events reported being transient and generally mild in severity. Mean levodopa Cmax values were attained at 0.8 to 1.8 hours postdose. Thereafter, plasma levodopa levels declined with a mean t1/2 that increased in a manner that depended on the dose of BIA 3-202. The increase in systemic exposure to levodopa (AUC0-infinity) occurred at all doses of BIA 3-202, attaining its maximum at 200 mg BIA 3-202 (95% conficence interval, 1.43-1.73). The mean Cmax and AUC0-infinity values of 3-OMD decreased dose proportionally in BIA 3-202-treated subjects, with differences being statistically significant for all the doses tested.

Plasma concentrations of endothelin-1 (ET-1) are increased in children with congenital heart disease associated with increased pulmonary blood flow. However, the role of ET-1 in the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension remains unclear. Preproendothelin-1 gene expression is increased in adults with advanced pulmonary hypertension. To characterize potential early molecular alterations in the ET-1 cascade induced by increased pulmonary blood flow and pulmonary hypertension, fetal lambs underwent in utero placement of an aortopulmonary vascular graft (shunt). RNase protection assays and Western blot analysis were performed on lung tissue prepared from 4-wk-old shunt lambs and age-matched controls. Endothelin-converting enzyme-1 [the enzyme responsible for the production of active ET-1 from big ET-1, mRNA (411%, p0.05)] and protein (170%, p0.05) were increased in lung tissue prepared from shunt lambs, compared with age-matched controls.

Insulin increases skeletal muscle blood flow in healthy young subjects by a nitric oxide (NO)-dependent mechanism. Impairment of this mechanism may contribute to the insulin resistance of normal aging. We tested the hypothesis that L-arginine, the endogenous precursor for NO synthesis, would augment insulin-mediated vasodilation and in so doing increase insulin-mediated glucose uptake (IMGU) in healthy elderly subjects. Experiments were conducted on healthy young (n = 9; age, 24 +/- 1 years; body mass index, 24 +/- 1 kg/m2) and old (n = 9; age, 77 +/- 2 years; BMI, 25 +/- 1 kg/m2) subjects.

Ghrelin, released from the stomach, stimulates food intake through activation of the ghrelin receptor (GHS-R) located on neuropeptide Y (NPY)/agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons in the hypothalamus. A role for the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its downstream effector uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) in the stimulatory effect of exogenous ghrelin on NPY/AgRP expression and food intake has been suggested. This study aimed to investigate whether a rise in endogenous ghrelin levels is able to influence hypothalamic AMPK activity, pACC, UCP2 and NPY/AgRP expression through activation of GHS-R. An increase in endogenous ghrelin levels was established by fasting (24h) or by induction of streptozotocin( STZ )-diabetes (15 days) in GHS-R(+/+) and GHS-R(-/-) mice. GHS-R(+/+) mice showed a significant increase in AgRP and NPY mRNA expression after fasting, which was not observed in GHS-R(-/-) mice. Fasting did not affect AMPK activity nor ACC phosphorylation in both genotypes and increased UCP2 mRNA expression. The hyperghrelinemia associated with STZ -induced diabetes was accompanied by an increased NPY and AgRP expression in GHS-R(+/+) but not in GHS-R(-/-) mice.

Protein kinase C (PKC) modulators are very attractive therapeutic targets in cancer. Since most cancer cells display increased glycolysis, elucidations of the effects of PKC activation on glycolysis is necessary for the development of effective medicine. In the present study, to clarify the role of PKC in the regulation of glycolysis, we examined the effect of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a PKC activator, on the expression and activity of glucose and lactic acid metabolism-related genes in human rhabdomyosarcoma cells (RD cells). In parallel to increases in glucose uptake and mRNA levels of glucose transporters (GLUTs) induced by PMA treatment for 6 h, the hexokinase (HK) mRNA level and activity were also significantly increased in RD cells. On the other hand, a significant increase in lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) mRNA level and activity was seen when the cells were incubated with PMA for 24 h, but not for 6 or 12 h, and was associated with lactic acid production. These effects by PMA treatment were markedly suppressed by Bisindolylmaleimide (BIM), a PKC inhibitor. Furthermore, chetomin, a hypoxia-inducible factor 1 ( HIF-1 ) inhibitor, completely abrogated the increment of LDH mRNA level and activity as well as monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 4, a lactic acid efflux transporter.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Marchigian Sardinian alcohol -preferring ( msP ) rats exhibit innate preference for alcohol, are highly sensitive to stress and stress-induced alcohol seeking. Genetic analysis showed that over-expression of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system of msP rats is correlated with the presence of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) occurring in the promoter region (position -1836 and -2097) of the CRF1 receptor (CRF1-R) gene. Here we examined whether these point mutations were associated to the innate alcohol preference, stress-induced drinking, and seeking. We have recently re-derived the msP rats to obtain two distinct lines carrying the wild type (GG) and the point mutations (AA), respectively. The phenotypic characteristics of these two lines were compared with those of unselected Wistar rats. Both AA and GG rats showed similar patterns of voluntary alcohol intake and preference. Similarly, the pharmacological stressor yohimbine (0.0, 0.625, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg) elicited increased operant alcohol self-administration under fixed and progressive ratio reinforcement schedules in all three lines. Following extinction, yohimbine (0.0, 0.625, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg) significantly reinstated alcohol seeking in the three groups. However, at the highest dose this effect was no longer evident in AA rats. Treatment with the CRF1-R antagonist antalarmin (0, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) significantly reduced alcohol -reinforced lever pressing in the AA line (10 and 20 mg/kg) while a weaker or no effect was observed in the Wistar and the GG group, respectively. Finally, antalarmin significantly reduced yohimbine-induced increase in alcohol drinking in all three groups.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

A group of adult rats was divided into two subgroups: one was submitted to long-term normobaric hypoxia (10% O2, two weeks) while the other (control group) was kept in the same room, breathing air. Animals from each subgroup were used to study either the norepinephrine content of the carotid body by high pressure liquid chromatography or to localize norepinephrine -containing structures using an immunocytochemical procedure (peroxidase-labelled antibodies on cryostat sections). The biochemical study showed, as expected, a large increase in carotid body norepinephrine content (19-fold) and turnover (ten-fold) in hypoxic rats. The immunocytochemical study revealed only a few norepinephrine -immunopositive glomus cells in sections through the carotid body of normoxic rats, whereas the carotid body of hypoxic rats showed a very large number of norepinephrine -positive glomus cells. This increase was quantified, using an image analyser, and it was found to constitute a 61-fold increase in the number of immunopositive profiles per section and a 29-fold increase in the immunopositive profile area/section area ratio.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) enhance phosphate excretion by the proximal tubule of the kidney by retrieval of the sodium-dependent phosphate transporters (Npt2a and Npt2c) from the apical plasma membrane. PTH activates adenylyl cyclase (AC) through PTH 1 receptors and stimulates the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. However, the precise role and isoform(s) of AC in phosphate homeostasis are not known. We report here that mice lacking AC6 ( AC6 (-/-)) have increased plasma PTH and FGF-23 levels compared with wild-type (WT) mice but comparable plasma phosphate concentrations. Acute activation of the calcium-sensing receptor or feeding a zero phosphate diet almost completely suppressed plasma PTH levels in both AC6 (-/-) and WT mice, indicating a secondary cause for hyperparathyroidism. Pharmacologic blockade of FGF receptors resulted in a comparable increase in plasma phosphate between genotypes, whereas urinary phosphate remained significantly higher in AC6 (-/-) mice. Compared with WT mice, AC6 (-/-) mice had reduced renal Npt2a and Npt2c protein abundance, with approximately 80% of Npt2a residing in lysosomes. WT mice responded to exogenous PTH with redistribution of Npt2a from proximal tubule microvilli to intracellular compartments and lysosomes alongside a PTH-induced dose-response relationship for fractional phosphate excretion and urinary cAMP excretion. These responses were absent in AC6 (-/-) mice.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

West Nile virus (WNV) is a reemerging pathogen that causes fatal encephalitis in several species, including mouse and human. Recently, we showed that the chemokine receptor CCR5 is critical for survival of mice infected with WNV, acting at the level of leukocyte trafficking to the brain. To test whether this receptor is also protective in man, we determined the frequency of CCR5 Delta32, a defective CCR5 allele found predominantly in Caucasians, in two independent cohorts of patients, one from Arizona and the other from Colorado, who had laboratory-confirmed, symptomatic WNV infection. The distribution of CCR5 Delta32 in a control population of healthy United States Caucasian random blood donors was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and CCR5 Delta32 homozygotes represented 1.0% of the total group (n = 1,318). In contrast, CCR5 Delta32 homozygotes represented 4.2% of Caucasians in the Arizona cohort (odds ratios [OR] = 4.4 [95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-11.8], P = 0.0013) and 8.3% of Caucasians in the Colorado cohort (OR = 9.1 [95% CI, 3.4-24.8], P  0.0001).

Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in the central nervous system. Inflammation disrupts the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is responsible for maintaining brain homeostasis. This study was aimed to investigate the functional role of microRNA (miR)-132 in hippocampal HT-22 cells under lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) stimulation. In vitro cell inflammatory model was constructed by LPS stimulation. Inflammatory cell injury was evaluated according to the alterations of cell viability, apoptosis, and expression of inflammatory cytokines. Then, miR-132 level after LPS treatment was assessed. Subsequently, miR-132 was abnormally expressed after cell transfection, and the effects of miR-132 on LPS -induced cell inflammatory injury as well as phosphorylated levels of key kinases in the NF-B and MAPK kinase (MEK)/ERK pathways were determined. The target gene of miR-132 was virtually screened and verified, and whether miR-132 affected HT-22 cells under LPS stimulation through regulating the target gene was verified. The results showed that the level of miR-132 was down-regulated by LPS in HT-22 cells, and the LPS -induced inflammatory injury could be reduced by miR-132 overexpression. Then, the phosphorylated levels of kinases in the NF-B and MEK/ERK pathways were decreased by miR-132 overexpression. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 ( TRAF6 ) was predicted and verified to be a target of miR-132. Moreover, the alterations induced by miR-132 overexpression in the LPS -treated HT-22 cells were abrogated by TRAF6 overexpression.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Ventilatory function and whole lung mucociliary clearance have been assessed in 10 patients with mild stable asthma following inhalation of 1 mg of the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist terbutaline sulphate (Bricanyl, Astra Pharmaceuticals) from a metered dose inhaler (MDI). Compared to placebo inhalation, terbutaline produced marked bronchodilatation (mean percentage increase in FEV1 14%, P less than 0.01). Mucociliary clearance (measured by the in vivo radioaerosol technique) was assessed on three occasions--control, followed by placebo or terbutaline studies in a double-blind, cross-over manner. Particles were removed from the lung at a similar rate in all three studies.

Wnt signaling regulates immunomodulatory functions during infection and inflammation. Employing NCCIT and HCT116 cells, having high endogenous Wnt signaling, we observed elevated levels of LDL receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6) and frizzled class receptor 10 (FZD10) and increases in -catenin, doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1), CD44 molecule (CD44), and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 (ALDH1A1). siRNA-induced knockdown of these receptors antagonized Topflash reporter activity and spheroid growth in vitro and elevated Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1) activity. Elevated mRNA and protein levels of LRP5/6 and FZD10 paralleled expression of WNT2b and WNT4 in colonic crypts at days 6 and 12 post- infection with Citrobacter rodentium (CR) and tended to decline at days 20-34. The CR mutant escV or the tankyrase inhibitor XAV939 attenuated these responses. A 3D-organoid assay in colonic crypts isolated from CR-infected mice revealed elevated levels of LRP5/6 and FZD10, and -catenin co-localization with enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (EZH2). Co-immunoprecipitation in the membrane fraction revealed that axin associates with LRP5/6 in CR-infected crypts, and this association was correlated with increased -catenin. Colon tumors from either CR-infected ApcPMin/+ or AOM/DSS-treated mice had high LRP5/6 or FZD10 levels, and chronic Notch blockade through the -secretase inhibitor dibenzazepine down-regulated LRP5/6 and FZD10 expression.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Alterations of leukotriene (LT) productivity in peritoneal macrophages (PM) from untreated rats (control) as well as from rats treated i.p. with thioglycollate broth ( TG ) were investigated on days 3, 7 and 14 after TG administration. The resident PM from the untreated rats produced mainly LTB4 and 5-HETE with small amounts of 12-HETE and LTD4 with only a trace of LTC4 when stimulated with the calcium ionophore A23187. The PM elicited from rats on days 3 and 7 produced more LTC4 than did the resident PM but fewer other lipoxygenase metabolites. On day 14, however, the elicited PM resembled the resident PM in terms of lipoxygenase metabolite production. Similar results were achieved in the presence of arachidonic acid and A23187. A decrease in lipoxygenase metabolism in the elicited PM was also suggested by using opsonized zymosan.

Selective antagonists have been used to classify the muscarinic receptors involved in the slow excitatory postsynaptic potential and slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential of the superior cervical ganglia of the rat, as recorded in 1 microM neostigmine, using a grease-gap method. Cardioselective M2 antagonists, e.g. AF-DX 116, depressed the slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential and enhanced the slow excitatory postsynaptic potential. The M1 selective antagonist pirenzepine depressed both potentials equally. The high potency of pirenzepine against the slow excitatory postsynaptic potential, however, indicates that it is mediated by M1 receptors. The slow excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potential s were found to be pharmacologically similar to the muscarinic agonist-induced depolarisation and hyperpolarisation of this preparation, respectively.

The 3' poly(A) tail of eukaryotic mRNAs and the poly(A) binding protein (PABP) play important roles in the regulation of translation. Recently, a human PABP-interacting protein, Paip2, which disrupts the PABP-poly(A) interaction and consequently inhibits translation, was described. To gain insight into the biological role of Paip2, we studied the Drosophila melanogaster Paip2 ( dPaip2 ). dPaip2 is the bona fide human Paip2 homologue, as it interacts with dPABP, inhibits binding of dPABP to the mRNA poly(A) tail, and reduces translation of a reporter mRNA by approximately 80% in an S2 cell-free translation extract. Ectopic overexpression of dPaip2 in Drosophila wings and wing discs results in a size reduction phenotype, which is due to a decrease in cell number. Clones of cells overexpressing dPaip2 in wing discs also contain fewer cells than controls. This phenotype can be explained by a primary effect on cell growth. Indeed, overexpression of dPaip2 in postreplicative tissues inhibits growth, inasmuch as it reduces ommatidia size in eyes and cell size in the larval fat body.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Tamoxifen and toremifene are two mostly used antiestrogens in the treatment of breast cancer. To compare their effect on bone in postmenopausal breast cancer patients we measured the urinary output of two bone resorption markers, pyridinoline (Pyr) and deoxypyridinoline (Dpyr) as well as bone density (BMD) in 30 breast cancer patients using either tamoxifen (20 mg/day, n = 15) or toremifene (40 mg/day, n = 15) as adjuvant treatment of stage II breast cancer for 1 year. The urinary output of Pyr and Dpyr were assessed before and after 6 and 12 months of the antiestrogen regimen. Lumbar and femoral BMD were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) before and after 12 months of treatment. Both tamoxifen and toremifene were associated with significant decreases in Pyr (mean fall 19.6% and 12.6%, respectively) and Dpyr (mean fall 21.6% and 15.5%, respectively) at 6 months. After 12 months' treatment, Pyr decreased by 30.8% and Dpyr by 21.2% in women using tamoxifen and significantly less in women using toremifene (10.1% and 4.9%, respectively). BMD in the lumbar spine decreased by 1.8% in the toremifene group but increased by 0.4% in the tamoxifen group; in the proximal femur, BMD increased slightly during both tamoxifen and toremifene treatment in all sites measured.

Eicosanoids and volatile anesthetics can influence cardiac reperfusion injury. Accordingly, we analyzed the effects of sevoflurane and isoflurane applied in clinically relevant concentrations on the myocardial production of prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 (TxA2) and on heart function. Isolated guinea pig hearts, perfused with crystalloid buffer, performed pressure-volume work. Between two working phases, hearts were subjected to 15 min of global ischemia followed by reperfusion. The hearts received no anesthetic, 1 minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration (MAC) isoflurane (1.2 vol%), or 0.5 and 1 MAC sevoflurane (1 vol% and 2 vol%), either only preischemically or pre- and postischemically. In additional groups, cyclooxygenase function was examined by an infusion of 1 microM arachidonic acid ( AA ) in the absence and presence of sevoflurane. The variables measured included the myocardial production of prostacyclin, TxA2 and lactate, consumption of pyruvate, coronary perfusion pressure, and the tissue level of isoprostane 8-iso-PGF2alpha. External heart work, determined pre- and postischemically, served to assess recovery of heart function. Volatile anesthetics had no impact on postischemic recovery of myocardial function (50%-60% recovery), perfusion pressure, lactate production, or isoprostane content. Release of prostacyclin and TxA2 was increased in the early reperfusion phase 5-8- and 2-4-fold, respectively, indicating enhanced AA liberation.

Autologous venous grafts, used to circumvent occluded coronary arteries during coronary artery bypass, often develop thrombosis and neointimal hyperplasia. During neointimal hyperplasia, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), exposed to substantially higher pressure and hemodynamic forces, proliferate and extracellular matrix accumulate causing narrowing of the vessel lumen. Activation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor ( IGF-1R ) has been confirmed to be critically involved in mechanical stretch-stimulated VSMC proliferation. However, the comprehensive mechanisms responsible for activation of IGF-1R in VSMCs by mechanical stretch remain unclear. This study found that miR-223 and miR-153, targeted to IGF-1R, were down-regulated in VSMCs under stretch stress by miRNA microarray analysis in conjunction with Target Scan analysis.

Insulin resistance in skeletal muscle is a feature associated with exposure to an excess of saturated fatty acids such as palmitate. Oleic acid has been shown to blunt palmitate -induced insulin resistance in muscle cells. However, there is no literature available regarding the effect of oleic acid on palmitate -induced insulin resistance in intact muscle. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of oleic acid on palmitate -induced insulin resistance in rat soleus muscle and its underlying mechanisms. For these purposes, oleic acid (1 mM) was administered for 12 h in the absence or presence of palmitate (2 mM). At the end of the experiment, plasmalemmal GLUT4, the phosphorylation of AS160 and Akt-2, and the total expression of these signaling proteins were examined. We found that treatment with palmitate for 12 h reduced insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and the phosphorylation of AS160 and Akt-2. However, the administration of oleic acid fully restored insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (P  0.05), as well as AS160 and Akt-2 phosphorylation (P  0.05) despite the continuous presence of palmitate. Wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3-K, only slightly prevented the oleic acid-induced improvements in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, and AS160 phosphorylation. However, this treatment completely inhibited the oleic acid-induced improvement in insulin-stimulated Akt-2 phosphorylation.

Controversy exists on whether dopamine ( DA ) stimulates or inhibits GnRH secretion and whether its effects are mediated via alpha-adrenergic receptors or dopaminergic receptors. As a means to examine this conflict, we have utilized an in vitro superfusion system to study the effects of DA, norepinephrine (NE), phentolamine (alpha-antagonist), pimozide ( DA antagonist), and two DA agonists (apomorphine and bromocryptine) on GnRH release from isolated mediobasal hypothalami from adult male rats. In this dynamic system, graded concentrations of both NE and DA (2.0 nM to 2.0 microM) led to a dose-dependent increase in GnRH output during the 10 min interval that followed each pulse dose of NE (P less than 0.02) or DA (P less than 0.05). The DA -induced GnRH release was reproducible, consistent, and significant over five successive pulses (20 microM) at 30-min intervals (P less than 0.02). Coinfusion of phentolamine (20 microM) prevented the DA (20 microM) induced release of GnRH (P less than 0.03), but pimozide (20 microM) had no significant effect on DA -induced GnRH release (P greater than 0.3). The two DA agonists, apomorphine and bromocryptine, at doses up to 2.0 microM and 200 nM, respectively, had no significant effect on GnRH release. To determine whether DA was causing a direct stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors or being enzymatically converted to NE which could then stimulate alpha-receptors to induce GnRH release, rats were injected with sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) (550 mg/kg BW) ip, 1 h before death.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Most spinal cord injury ( SCI ) patients suffer from chronic pain. Effective therapy for this pain is lacking, and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The spinal superficial dorsal horn ( SDH ) contains neuronal circuits capable of modulating primary afferent information involved in pain processing. KCC2 is an isoform of the K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter that contributes to the regulation of transmembrane anion gradient which plays a key role in shaping GABA(A) receptor-mediated signalling in the CNS. We tested the hypothesis that SCI causes down-regulation of KCC2 distal to the injury and contributes to the neuronal hyperresponsiveness and pain-related behaviours. SCI was a hemisection at T(13) level of adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Spinal sagittal slices with attached dorsal roots (DR) were prepared from L(4) to L(6) level. The reversal potentials of GABA responses (E(GABA)) and DR-evoked IPSPs and EPSPs of L(4-6) SDH neurones in sham-operated and SCI rats were compared using gramicidin-perforated patch-clamp recordings. Here we report that thoracic SCI -induced down-regulation of KCC2 in the lumbar SDH parallels the development of allodynia. The subsequent changes of E(GABA) in SDH neurones attenuate the GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory synaptic transmission. These changes cause certain normally subthreshold primary A and C fibre inputs to evoke action potential output in SDH neurones.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are a family of serine-threonine protein kinases involved in many cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, inflammation, and cell death. Activation of several MAPKs, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), results in stimulation of activator protein 1 (AP-1), which promotes gene transcription. Previous studies have demonstrated that varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection activates ERK1/2, p38, and JNK to promote viral replication, but the underlying mechanism(s) is unclear. To identify viral proteins responsible for the activation of MAPK, we used a proteomic approach to screen viral proteins for AP-1 promoter activation by an AP-1-luciferase reporter assay. We found that VZV ORF12 protein, located in the tegument of virions, enhances AP-1 reporter activity. This effect of ORF12 protein was markedly inhibited by a MAPK/ERK kinase 1 and 2 (MEK1/2) inhibitor (U0126), partially blocked by a p38 inhibitor (SB202190), but not inhibited by a JNK inhibitor (SP600125). Expression of VZV ORF12 protein in cells resulted in phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 but not JNK. Infection of cells with a VZV ORF12 deletion mutant resulted in reduced levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) compared to infection with wild-type VZV. Furthermore, deletion of ORF12 rendered VZV-infected cells more susceptible to staurosporine-induced apoptosis.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Two proteases cathepsin D (cath D) and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) are tissue markers associated with an increased risk of metastasis in breast cancer. We investigated whether cath D, the major aspartyl protease overexpressed by breast cancer cells can trigger a proteolytic cascade via activation of plasminogens at the extracellular pH measured in hypoxic tumors. The effects of the aspartyl protease inhibitor pepstatin on the plasminogen activator ( PA ) system were analysed by conditioning media of human MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells at pH 6.6 and pH 7.4. Zymography analysis of culture media showed that pepstatin inhibited the secreted activity of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) but not that of uPA. tPA was identified on the basis of the molecular weight, the immunoreactivity with relevant antibodies and the resistance to amiloride, a specific uPA inhibitor. The secreted tPA activity measured by a chromogenic assay in the presence of amiloride was also inhibited by pepstatin at pH 6.6. Surprisingly, pepstatin did not affect secreted tPA protein concentration but markedly increased the amount of the secreted plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( PA I-1).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The goal of this study was to elucidate whether triggering the sphingomyelin pathway modulates LPS -initiated responses. For this purpose we investigated the effects of N-acetylsphingosine (C(2)-ceramide) on LPS -induced production of NO and PGE(2) in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages and explored the signaling pathways involved. We found that within a range of 10-50 microM, C(2)-ceramide inhibited LPS -elicited NO synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 induction accompanied by a reduction in NO and PGE(2) formation. By contrast, a structural analog of C(2)-ceramide that does not elicit functional activity, C(2)-dihydroceramide, did not affect the LPS response. The nuclear translocation and DNA binding study revealed that ceramide can inhibit LPS -induced NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation. The immunocomplex kinase assay indicated that IkappaB kinase activity stimulated by LPS was inhibited by ceramide, which concomitantly reduced the IkappaBalpha degradation caused by LPS within 1-6 h. In concert with the decreased cytosolic p65 protein level, LPS treatment resulted in rapid nuclear accumulation of NF-kappaB subunit p65 and its association with the cAMP-responsive element binding protein. Ceramide coaddition inhibited all the LPS responses. In addition, LPS -induced PKC and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation were overcome by ceramide.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
In conclusion, we suggest that ceramide inhibition of <el> LPS <le>-mediated induction of inducible NO synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 is due to reduction of the activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1, which might result from ceramide's inhibition of <el> LPS <le>-stimulated <re> IkappaB kinase <er>, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and protein kinase C. negative----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

Using three experimental approaches, we have addressed the questions of whether the presence of saturably bound thrombin plays a role in potentiating the activation of platelet phospholipase C (PLC) and/or accumulation of the 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides ( 3-PPI ), i.e. phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, and whether the generation of tethered ligand (Vu, T-K.H., Hung, D. T., Wheaton, V. I., and Coughlin, S. R. (1991) Cell 64, 1057-1068) by thrombin can account fully for thrombin's proteolytic effects in activating platelets, as gauged by the above parameters. We have 1) measured PLC activation or 3-PPI after we have exposed platelets to thrombin for various periods and either blocked thrombin's proteolytic activity without interrupting its binding or blocked both binding and proteolytic activity of thrombin ; 2) attempted to potentiate 3-PPI accumulation, using combinations of protein kinase C stimulation, Ca2+ elevation, and saturating but proteolytically inactive thrombin s; and 3) compared the activation of platelets by thrombin with activation by the " thrombin " receptor-directed peptide, SFLLRNPNDKYEPF (SFLL; a portion of the tethered ligand created by thrombin's proteolytic activity), and examined the effect of thrombin on this latter activation.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We examined the intracellular metabolic fate of plasma glucose during a hyperglycemic clamp in impaired glucose -tolerant (IGT; n = 21) and normal glucose -tolerant subjects (n = 10) using a combination of [3-(3)H] glucose infusion with measurement of [(3)H]water formation and indirect calorimetry. IGT was associated with approximately 35% reduced first-phase insulin responses, normal second-phase insulin response, and 25-30% reduced insulin sensitivity, resulting in approximately 35% reduced plasma glucose disposal. This was coupled with approximately 55% reduced storage of plasma glucose (P  0.01) and approximately 15-20% reduced glycolysis of plasma glucose (P  0.03), accounting for approximately 75 and 25% of the reduction in glucose disposal, respectively. Decreased glucose oxidation accounted for virtually all the decrease in glycolysis. Therefore, nonoxidative glycolysis of plasma glucose in IGT was similar to that in NGT (P > 0.9) and accounted for an increased proportion of systemic glucose disposal (P  0.05).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Mice homozygous for mutations in Dact1 (also called Dapper or Frodo) phenocopy human malformations involving the spine, genitourinary system and distal digestive tract. We traced this phenotype to disrupted germ-layer morphogenesis at the primitive streak. Notably, heterozygous mutation of Vangl2, a transmembrane component of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, rescued recessive Dact1 phenotypes, whereas loss of Dact1 reciprocally rescued semidominant Vangl2 phenotypes. We show that Dact1, an intracellular protein, forms a complex with Vangl2. In Dact1 mutants, Vangl2 was increased at the primitive streak, where cells ordinarily undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. This is associated with abnormal E-cadherin distribution and changes in biochemical measures of the PCP pathway.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Regular exercise can protect the heart against external stimuli, but the mechanism is not well understood. We determined the role of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) in regulating swimming exercise-mediated cardiac protection against -adrenergic receptor overstimulation with isoproterenol (ISO) in mice. Ten-week-old AMPK 2+/+ and AMPK 2-knockout ( AMPK 2-/-) littermates were subjected to 4 weeks of swimming training (50 min daily, 6 days a week) or housed under sedentary conditions. The mice received daily subcutaneous injection of ISO (5 mg/kg/d), a nonselective -adrenergic receptor agonist, during the last 2 weeks of swimming training. Swimming training alleviated ISO-induced cardiac fibrosis in AMPK 2+/+ mice but not AMPK 2-/- mice. Swimming training activated cardiac AMPK in AMPK 2+/+ mice. Furthermore, swimming training attenuated ISO-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and expression of NADPH oxidase and promoted the expression of antioxidant enzymes in AMPK 2+/+ mice but not AMPK 2-/- mice.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The ionic mechanisms underlying the negative dromotropic effect of adenosine were studied in calcium-tolerant myocytes isolated from the region of the rabbit atrioventricular (AV) node. Action potentials and membrane currents were recorded by using the whole cell patch clamp technique. Adenosine (1 to 50 microM) abolished the spontaneous activity of AV node myocytes with hyperpolarization of the membrane potential. Voltage clamp experiments showed that adenosine induced an inwardly rectifying, time-independent potassium current. These effects were antagonized by 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine and produced by ribose 5-phosphate isomerase A, indicating that they were mediated by the A1 adenosine receptor. Adenosine also had a small direct inhibitory action on the inward calcium current ( ICa ) but had a more marked indirect action following stimulation of the calcium current by isoprenaline. The isoprenaline-induced increase in ICa was abolished in the presence of adenosine 10 microM. In cells pretreated with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), the isoprenaline-induced increase in ICa was not reduced by the addition of adenosine. Coincubation of the cells with L-NAME plus L-arginine (the endogenous substrate of nitric oxide synthase) restored the adenosine-induced attenuation of ICa. A membrane permeable analogue of cGMP, 8Br cGMP, an inhibitor of cGMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase, prevented the antiadrenergic effect of adenosine.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Cholesterol absorption and metabolism and LDL and HDL kinetics were investigated in 11 hypercholesterolaemic non-insulin-dependent diabetic men off and on a hypolipidaemic treatment with sitostanol ester, (3 g sitostanol daily) dissolved in rapeseed oil margarine, by a double-blind crossover study design. Serum total, VLDL and LDL cholesterol and apoprotein B fell significantly by 6 +/- 2, 12 +/- 6, 9 +/- 3 and 6 +/- 2%, mean +/- SEM, and HDL cholesterol was increased by 11 +/- 4% (p  0.05) by sitostanol ester. LDL cholesterol and apoprotein B were significantly decreased in the dense (1.037-1.055 g/ml), but not light, LDL subfraction due to a significantly diminished transport rate for LDL apoprotein B, while the fractional catabolic rate was unchanged. HDL kinetics, measured with autologous apoprotein A I, was unaffected by sitostanol ester. Cholesterol absorption efficiency was markedly reduced from 25 +/- 2 to 9 +/- 2% (p  0.001) during sitostanol ester followed by proportionately decreased serum plant sterol proportions.

Alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) hydrolyzes a variety of monophosphate esters and plays an important role in phosphorus (P) metabolism. Several nutrients in food have been reported to affect intestinal ALP activity in animal models. Previous reports indicated that high levels of P or phosphate in diets decreased intestinal ALP activity in rats. Because potato starch contains considerable amounts of esterified P, unlike other starch -derived plants, we hypothesized that the feeding of potato starch would decrease ALP activity in the intestinal tract. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (7 weeks old) were fed 3 different types of diet containing 60% corn starch or 1 of 2 types of potato starch with different esterified P content for 1 or 5 weeks. Body weight and food intake of each rat were measured every day throughout the experimental periods. At the end of the feeding periods, the small intestine was removed to determine ALP activity in the mucosal tissues. Significant differences were observed in ALP activity in the small intestine between the 2 feeding periods, among the 4 segments of the small intestine, and among the 3 diet groups.

Cytokine storm is suggested as one of the major pathological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection, although the mechanism for initiation of a hyper-inflammatory response, and multi-organ damage from viral infection is poorly understood. In this virus-cell interaction study, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 infection or viral spike protein expression alone inhibited angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor protein expression. The spike protein promoted an angiotensin II type 1 receptor ( AT1 ) mediated signaling cascade, induced the transcriptional regulatory molecules NF-B and AP-1/c-Fos via MAPK activation, and increased IL-6 release. SARS-CoV-2 infected patient sera contained elevated levels of IL-6 and soluble IL-6 R. Up-regulated AT1 receptor signaling also influenced the release of extracellular soluble IL-6 R by the induction of the ADAM-17 protease. Use of the AT1 receptor antagonist, Candesartan cilexetil, resulted in down-regulation of IL-6 /soluble IL-6 R release in spike expressing cells. Phosphorylation of STAT3 at the Tyr705 residue plays an important role as a transcriptional inducer for SOCS3 and MCP-1 expression. Further study indicated that inhibition of STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation in SARS-CoV-2 infected and viral spike protein expressing epithelial cells did not induce SOCS3 and MCP-1 expression. Introduction of culture supernatant from SARS-CoV-2 spike expressing cells on a model human liver endothelial Cell line (TMNK-1), where transmembrane IL-6 R is poorly expressed, resulted in the induction of STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation as well as MCP-1 expression.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

FX activation occurred on human umbilical vein EC surfaces without the addition of external coagulation proteins, proteolytic enzymes, or phospholipids. Tumour necrosis factor, which suppresses the generation of activated protein C and increases TF, augmented FX activation.

Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I), known as Hurler syndrome in the severe form, is a lysosomal storage disease due to alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) deficiency. It results in fragmentation of elastin fibers in the aorta and heart valves via mechanisms that are unclear, but may result from the accumulation of the glycosaminoglycans heparan and dermatan sulfate. Elastin fragmentation causes aortic dilatation and valvular insufficiency, which can result in cardiovascular disease. The pathophysiology of aortic disease was evaluated in MPS I mice. MPS I mice have normal elastic fiber structure and aortic compliance at early ages, which suggests that elastin assembly is normal. Elastin fragmentation and aortic dilatation are severe at 6 months, which is temporally associated with marked increases in mRNA and enzyme activity for two elastin -degrading proteins, matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP-12) and cathepsin S. Upregulation of these genes likely involves activation of STAT proteins, which may be induced by structural stress to smooth muscle cells from accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in lysosomes.

Experimental animals were exposed to a pressure of 6 atmospheres absolute breathing oxygen, and were randomly assigned to two groups in which MRI was performed immediately after the appearance of seizures or 7 days later. Control groups were not exposed to hyperbaric oxygen. Our MRI protocols included T2*-weighted images, T2 maps, diffusion-weighted echo-planar pulse sequence, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images.

When the plastids are severely damaged by photooxidation in virtually carotenoid-free mustard (Sinapis alba L.) seedling cotyledons (made carotenoid-free by the application of Norflurazon, NF), almost no SSU, no SSU precursor, LHCP and LHCP precursor can be detected by immunological assays, and almost no translatable mRNA of SSU and LHCP can be found, although the levels and rates of phytochrome -mediated syntheses of representative cytoplasmic, mitochondrial and glyoxisomal enzymes are not adversely affected and morphogenesis of the mustard seedling proceeds normally (Reiß et al. 1983; Planta 159, 518-528). Norflurazon per se has no effect on the amount of translatable mRNA of SSU and LHCP as shown by irradiation of NF-treated seedlings with far-red light (FR) which strongly activates phytochrome but does not cause photooxidation in the plastids.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Alpha-synuclein is a neuronal protein that is implicated in the control of synaptic vesicle function and in Parkinson's disease (PD). Consequently, alterations of alpha-synuclein levels may play a role in neurotransmission and in PD pathogenesis. However, the factors that regulate alpha-synuclein levels are unknown. Growth factors mediate neurotrophic and plasticity effects in CNS neurons, and may play a role in disease states. Here we examine the regulation of alpha-synuclein levels in primary CNS neurons, with particular emphasis on dopaminergic neurons. E18 rat cortical neurons and dopaminergic neurons of E14 rat ventral midbrain showed an induction of alpha-synuclein protein levels with maturation in culture. Application of basic Fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) promoted alpha-synuclein expression selectively within dopaminergic, and not GABAergic or cortical neurons. This induction was blocked by actinomycin D, but not by inhibition of bFGF -induced glial proliferation. alpha-Synuclein levels were not altered by glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), or by apoptotic stimuli.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The PRDI-BF1/ Blimp-1 protein is a transcription al repressor required for normal B-cell differentiation, and it has been implicated in the repression of beta-interferon (IFN-beta) and c-myc gene expression. Here, we show that PRDI-BF1 represses transcription of the IFN-beta promoter and of an artificial promoter through an active repression mechanism. We also identified a minimal repression domain in PRDI-BF1 that is sufficient for transcription al repression when tethered to DNA as a Gal4 fusion protein. Remarkably, this repression domain interacts specifically with hGrg, TLE1, and TLE2 proteins, all of which are members of the Groucho family of transcription al corepressors. In addition, the hGrg protein itself can function as a potent repressor when tethered to DNA through the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. We also find that the amino-terminal glutamine-rich domains of hGrg and TLE1 are sufficient to mediate dimerization of the two Groucho family proteins. Proteins containing only this domain can function as a dominant-negative inhibitor of PRDI-BF1 repression, and can significantly increase the IFN-beta promoter activity after virus induction.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

1. The clinical use of doxorubicin is limited by the development of severe cardiomyopathies linked, at least in part, to an abnormal increase in the rate of apoptotic cell death. Because cell shrinkage is considered to be a crucial step at the onset of apoptosis, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether a brief hypo-osmotic stress, which leads to an increase in cell volume, could interfere with the induction of apoptosis by doxorubicin in adult cardiomyocytes. 2. Cell volume expansion results in intracellular accumulation of cAMP, so we secondarily tested whether the protective effect of hypo-osmotic stress could be related to the cAMP pathway. Accordingly, apoptosis was induced by doxorubicin (1 micromol/L) in cardiomyocytes freshly isolated from New Zealand adult rabbit hearts. 3. Exposure to doxorubicin in an iso-osmotic medium (290 mOsmol/kg H2O) induced a rapid decrease in cell volume, as well as increases in annexin V labelling and caspase-3 activity, two biological markers of apoptosis. These effects of doxorubicin were abolished by 15 min pretreatment with hypo-osmotic stress at 220 mOsmol/kgH2O (HS 220). 4. This cytoprotective effect of HS 220 was still observed when doxorubicin was added to the medium 60 min later, but it was abolished when the pretreatment by HS 220 was associated with the protein kinase A inhibitor KT 5720 (200 nmol/L). 5. Conversely, 15 min pretreatment with either the cAMP analogue 8-bromo-cAMP (0.5 mmol/L) or the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin (10 micromol/L) inhibited apoptosis induced by doxorubicin. 6.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Previous studies have shown that cytochrome P450-Arachidonic Acid (P450- AA ) metabolites modify the vascular tone of several vessels and that vasopressin ( AVP ) stimulates P450- AA metabolism. Thus, in the present study, we decided to investigate if the vasoconstrictor effect of AVP is related to activation of P450- AA metabolism. We used the isolated perfused kidney of a rat, to test this hypothesis. Bolus injection of AVP (5.5, 11, 22 and 45 ng) increased the perfusion pressure of the isolated kidney of a rat by 66 +/- 2, 87 +/- 4, 110 +/- 2 and 130 +/- 3 mmHg respectively. This AVP -induced vasoconstriction was significantly reduced by inhibition of AA metabolism with ETYA, or 7 ethoxyresorsorufin (7ER). Furthermore, in vivo induction of P450 system with dexamethasone, enhanced the AVP -induced vasoconstrictor effect. Conversely, depletion of P450 system with SnCl2 diminished the vasoconstrictor response to AVP. Measurement of P450-14cAA metabolites in the renal effluent, showed the presence of 3 radioactive peaks. The % of the recovered radioactivity was 0.12 +/- 0.05%, 0.11 +/- 0.03% and 1.13 +/- 0.5% and corresponded to Dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHTs), Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) respectively, when kidneys were stimulated by AVP (300 ng) the % recovered were 0.34 +/- 0.01%, 0.38 +/- 0.01% and 3.11 +/- 0.7% for the DHTs, HETEs and EETs respectively.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The effect of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), morphine, haloperidol and chlordiazepoxide on the exhibition of the signs of the quasi- morphine withdrawal syndrome was studied in rats. In preliminary studies approximately equi-sedative doses of these drugs were chosen. Morphine and THC produced a very similar degree of suppression of the signs of the quasi- morphine withdrawal, but unlike morphine, the effects of THC were not reversed by the narcotic antagonist, naloxone. The dopamine receptor antagonist, haloperidol, produced a moderate suppression of the withdrawal syndrome and chlordiazepoxide was without significant effect.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) increase calcium transients in rodent osteoblastic cells. To investigate the role of phospholipase C (PLC) in these hormone-stimulated calcium signals, the effects of U-73122 (1-[6-[[17 beta-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)- trien-17-yl]amino]hexyl]-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione), a reported PLC inhibitor, and its inactive analog, U-73343 (1-[6[[17 beta-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl]amino]hexyl]- 1H-pyrrolidine-2,5-dione), were determined. Intracellular calcium transients were measured in UMR-106 cells with the fluorescent indicator fluo-3. In normal calcium containing medium, prior exposure (3 min) to U-73122 inhibited ET-1 and PTH stimulated calcium transients in a dose-dependent (0.2-10 microM) manner with an IC50 of 1.5-1.8 microM. A concentration of 6-8 microM was required for complete inhibition of responses to 100 nM ET-1 or PTH. U-73343 elicited no effects over this concentration range. In cells in which external calcium was reduced to less than 1 microM by the addition of EGTA, ET-1 signals were completely inhibited by 4-6 microM U-73122 and the IC50 was 0.8 microM. In the low external calcium medium, the PTH response was abolished by 2 microM U-73122 (IC50 = 0.5 microM). U-73122, 8 microM, significantly (P  0.01) inhibited the effect of ET-1 on inositol trisphosphate production at 3 min whereas U-73343 did not.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

In vitro result with mouse hippocampal neuron and SK-N-MC, high glucose stimulated A secretion and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, high glucose increased BACE1 and APP-C99 expressions, which were reversed by a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger. Indeed, high glucose increased intracellular ROS levels and HIF-1 expression, associated with regulation of BACE1 and Liver X Receptor  (LXR). In addition, high glucose induced ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) down-regulation, was associated with LXR-induced lipid raft reorganization and BACE1 localization on the lipid raft.

Ricinoleic acid (RA; 12-hydroxy-cis-9-18:1) is the main fatty acid component of castor oil. Although a precursor for CLA synthesis in lactic acid bacteria, RA was found previously not to form CLA in ruminal digesta but to have some inhibitory properties. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the potential of RA to modulate ruminal biohydrogenation and methanogenesis. Ruminal digesta from 4 sheep receiving a mixed hay-concentrate diet was incubated in vitro with 0.167 g/L of linoleic acid (LA; cis-9,cis-12-18:2) or with a combination of LA and RA or LA and castor oil (LA, RA, and castor oil added to a final concentration of 0.167 g/L) in the presence and absence of lipase. The CLA rumenic acid (cis-9,trans-11-18:2) accumulated when either RA or castor oil and lipase was present. Vaccenic acid (VA; trans-11-18:1) also accumulated, and a decrease of the rate of production of stearic acid (SA; 18:0) was observed. When LA was incubated with castor oil in the absence of lipase, no effects on biohydrogenation were observed. Ricinoleic acid at 0.02 g/L did not affect growth of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens but it inhibited growth of Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus. Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus but not B. fibrisolvens metabolized RA to 12-hydroxystearate.

Proteinuria and hyperphosphatemia are cardiovascular risk factors independent of GFR. We hypothesized that proteinuria induces relative phosphate retention via increased proximal tubule phosphate reabsorption. To test the clinical relevance of this hypothesis, we studied phosphate handling in nephrotic children and patients with CKD. Plasma fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) concentration, plasma phosphate concentration, and tubular reabsorption of phosphate increased during the proteinuric phase compared with the remission phase in nephrotic children. Cross-sectional analysis of a cohort of 1738 patients with CKD showed that albuminuria300 mg/24 hours is predictive of higher phosphate levels, independent of GFR and other confounding factors. Albuminuric patients also displayed higher plasma FGF-23 and parathyroid hormone levels. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these observations, we induced glomerular proteinuria in two animal models. Rats with puromycin-aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic proteinuria displayed higher renal protein expression of the sodium- phosphate co-transporter NaPi-IIa, lower renal Klotho protein expression, and decreased phosphorylation of FGF receptor substrate 2, a major FGF-23 receptor substrate.

Cerebral ischemia is encompassed by cerebrovascular apoptosis, yet the mechanisms behind apoptosis regulation are not fully understood. We previously demonstrated inhibition of endothelial apoptosis by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) through upregulation of poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) expression. However, PARP overactivation through oxidative stress can lead to necrosis. This study tested the hypothesis that neuropilin-1 ( NP-1 ), an alternative VEGF receptor, regulates the response to cerebral ischemia by modulating PARP expression and, in turn, apoptosis inhibition by VEGF. In endothelial cell culture, NP-1 colocalized with VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and acted as its coreceptor. This significantly enhanced VEGF-induced PARP mRNA and protein expression demonstrated by receptor-specific inhibitors and VEGF-A isoforms. NP-1 augmented the inhibitory effect of VEGF/VEGFR-2 interaction on apoptosis induced by adhesion inhibition through the V-integrin inhibitor cRGDfV. NP-1 /VEGFR-2 signal transduction involved JNK and Akt. In rat models of permanent and temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion, the ischemic cerebral hemispheres displayed endothelial and neuronal apoptosis next to increased endothelial NP-1 and VEGFR-2 expression compared to non-ischemic cerebral hemispheres, sham-operated or untreated controls. Increased vascular superoxide dismutase-1 and catalase expression as well as decreased glycogen reserves indicated oxidative stress in the ischemic brain.

The markedly increased survival of treated mice derived predominantly from reduced proliferation of CD4 cells in response to tumor.

Regulation of insulin gene expression in response to increases in blood glucose levels is essential for maintaining normal glucose homeostasis; however, the exact mechanisms by which glucose stimulates insulin gene transcription are not known. We have shown previously that glucose stimulates insulin gene expression by causing the hyperacetylation of histone H4 at the insulin promoter. We demonstrate that the histone acetyltransferase p300 is recruited to the insulin promoter only at high concentrations of glucose via its interaction with the beta-cell-specific transcription factor Pdx-1. Disruption of the function of the endogenous Pdx-1 abolishes the recruitment of p300 to the insulin gene promoter at high concentrations of glucose and results in decreased histone H4 acetylation and insulin gene expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the glucose-dependent interaction of Pdx-1 with p300 is regulated by a phosphorylation event that changes the localization of Pdx-1.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

To determine whether the hypoferremic response to inflammation requires neutrophils, we administered human recombinant IL-1 to mice made neutropenic with cyclophosphamide. With single intraperitoneal injections of IL-1 the plasma iron concentrations decreased significantly in mice with either normal neutrophil counts or neutropenia. After single injections transferrin concentrations were not significantly changed, but the decrease in serum iron lowered mean transferrin saturations from a baseline of 45 to 24-30% in nonneutropenic mice, and from 99 to 70-77% in neutropenic mice. Similar changes were observed after intraperitoneal injections of Escherichia coli. 4-d continuous infusions of IL-1 also led to reductions in serum iron concentrations, but transferrin concentrations doubled. The combination of a decrease in serum iron and an increase in transferrin concentration after chronic infusion in neutropenic mice led to a greater decline in mean transferrin saturations, from a baseline of 110 to 25%. In mice not given cyclophosphamide, chronic IL-1 infusion was associated with a reduction in mean hemoglobin concentrations from 14.7 to 13.5 g/dl, consistent with restricted availability of iron for erythropoiesis associated with low saturation of transferrin.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

During chronological aging of budding yeast cells, the culture medium can become acidified, and this acidification limits cell survival. As a consequence, buffering the culture medium to pH 6 significantly extends chronological life span under standard conditions in synthetic medium. In this study, we assessed whether a similar process occurs during replicative aging of yeast cells. We find no evidence that buffering the pH of the culture medium to pH levels either higher or lower than the initial pH of the medium is able to significantly extend replicative lifespan.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Phasic respiratory bursting in the facial nerve (FN) can be uncoupled from phrenic bursting by application of 9 cmH(2)O positive end-expired pressure ( PEEP ). This response reflects excitation of expiratory-inspiratory ( EI ) and preinspiratory (Pre-I) facial neurons during the Pre-I period and inhibition of EI neurons during inspiration (I). Because activation of pulmonary C-fiber (PCF) receptors can inhibit the discharge of EI and Pre-I neurons, we hypothesized that PCF receptor activation via capsaicin would attenuate or abolish uncoupled FN bursting with an increase from 3 cmH(2)O (baseline) to 9 cmH(2)O PEEP. Neurograms were recorded in the FN and phrenic nerve in anesthetized, ventilated, vagally intact adult Wistar rats. Increasing PEEP to 9 cmH(2)O resulted in a persistent rhythmic discharge in the FN during phrenic quiescence (i.e., uncoupled bursting). Combination of PEEP with intrajugular capsaicin injection severely attenuated or eliminated uncoupled bursting in the FN (P  0.05). Additional experiments examined the pattern of facial motoneuron (vs. neurogram) bursting during PEEP application and capsaicin treatment. These single-fiber recordings confirmed that Pre-I and EI (but not I) neurons continued to burst during PEEP -induced phrenic apnea. Capsaicin treatment during PEEP substantially inhibited Pre-I and EI neuron discharge. Finally, analyses of FN and motoneuron bursting across the respiratory cycle indicated that the inhibitory effects of capsaicin were more pronounced during the Pre-I period.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The addition of platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) to serum-starved fibroblasts induces increased motility, formation of lamellipodia, increased ruffling activity, and actin ring structures associated with dorsal ruffles. Involvement of the phosphatidylinositol cycle (PI-cycle) in these morphological changes was investigated by observing the effects of neomycin, an inhibitor of the PI-cycle, on cultured human foreskin fibroblasts. The role of actin in the changes was investigated by using cytochalasin D (CD). Actin in detergent-extracted cells was labelled with TRITC-phalloidin and examined with fluorescence microscopy. Using PDGF and neomycin simultaneously potentiated lamellipodia formation, ruffling activity, as well as the number of cells with actin rings. Furthermore, neomycin by itself induced morphological changes similar to those induced by PDGF. Quantitation of actin rings showed dose and time dependency for PDGF and neomycin respectively, with a maximal number of cells containing rings after 15 min of exposure to either 3.5 mM neomycin or 10 ng PDGF /ml. Comparing the two substances, PDGF induced ring formation in a greater number of cells. These processes were inhibited by the presence of CD. PDGF - and neomycin-induced changes in the actin cytoskeleton were also observed in human embryonic lung fibroblasts, human glial cells, and embryonic mouse fibroblasts, all of which are known to express PDGF -receptors.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

One factor that significantly contributes to renal allograft loss is chronic calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) nephrotoxicity (CIN). Among other factors, the complement (C-) system has been proposed to be involved CIN development. Hence, we investigated the impact of CNI s on intracellular signalling and the effects on the C-system in human renal tubule cells. In a qPCR array, CNI treatment upregulated C-factors and downregulated SOCS-3 and the complement inhibitors CD46 and CD55. Additionally, ERK1/-2 was required for these regulations. Following knock-down and overexpression of SOCS-3, we found that SOCS-3 inhibits ERK1/-2 signalling. Finally, we assessed terminal complement complex formation, cell viability and apoptosis. Terminal complement complex formation was induced by CNI s. Cell viability was significantly decreased, whereas apoptosis was increased. Both effects were reversed under complement component-depleted conditions. In vivo, increased ERK1/-2 phosphorylation and SOCS-3 downregulation were observed at the time of transplantation in renal allograft patients who developed a progressive decline of renal function in the follow-up compared to stable patients. The progressive cohort also had lower total C3 levels, suggesting higher complement activity at baseline.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Our previous work has shown that polymorphonuclear neutrophils ( PMN s) require cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release and autocrine purinergic signaling for their activation. Here we studied in a mouse model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) whether sepsis affects this purinergic signaling process and thereby alters PMN responses after sepsis. Using high-performance liquid chromatography, we found that plasma ATP, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) concentrations increased up to 6-fold during the first 8 h after CLP, reaching top levels that were significantly higher than those in sham control animals without CLP. Although leukocyte and PMN counts in sham animals increased significantly after 4 h, these blood cell counts decreased in sepsis animals. CD11b expression on the cell surface of PMN s of septic animals was significantly higher compared with sham and untreated control animals. These findings suggest increased PMN activation and sequestration of PMN from the circulation after sepsis. Plasma ATP levels correlated with CD11b expression, suggesting that increased ATP concentrations in plasma contribute to PMN activation. We found that treatment of septic mice with the ATP receptor antagonist suramin diminished CD11b expression, indicating that plasma ATP contributes to PMN activation by stimulating P2 receptors of PMN s. Increased PMN activation can protect the host from invading microorganisms. However, increased PMN activation can also be detrimental by promoting secondary organ damage.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The group of "high ceiling" diuretics consists of a variety of chemically different potent diuretic and saluretic substances. Appart from a few exemptions direct evidence for an action of these substances in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (TAL) is still lacking. For furosemide, we have reported recently that it inhibits most likely the Na+-2 Cl--K+ cotransport system present in the lumen membrane of the TAL. The present study tests: 1. whether other "high ceiling" diuretics have a similar site and mode of action, and 2. how modifications of the furosemide molecule alter the inhibitory potency. Isolated cortical TAL (cTAL) segments (n = 185) of rabbit kidneys were perfused in vitro. The equivalent short circuit current (Isc = transepithelial PD/transepithelial resistance), as a measure of active salt transport was correlated to the dose of 64 substances. Several diuretics, such as 2-aminomethyl-4-(1,1-dimethyl-ethyl)-6-iodophenol hydrochloride (MK 447), hydrochlorothiazide, muzolimine, etozoline, tizolimide, amiloride, and triamterene were ineffective both from the lumen and basolateral side at concentrations as high as 10(-4) - 10(-3) mol X 1(-1). The phenoxyacetic acids ethacrynic acid, indacrinone (MK 196), and to less an extend tienilic acid were inhibitory active. They differed from furosemide in one or more of the following criteria: delayed onset, incomplete reversibility, stronger action from the bath, different slope of the dose response curve. Similarly, 1-ozolinone acted stronger from the bath. In contrast, the diuretics of the furosemide type and related compounds (bumetanide and piretanide) showed rapid onset and complete reversibility of inhibition. These substances acted stronger from the lumen.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
We conclude that the so called "high ceiling" or "loop" diuretics consist of at least 3 groups: 1. drugs that do not interfere with the active salt transport in the cTAL segment, 2. drugs that interfere by so far not characterised mechanisms, and 3. drugs of the furosemide <el> type <le> which inhibit the <re> Na+-2 Cl--K+ cotransport <er> system in the lumen membrane of the cTAL segment. negative----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

We have previously shown that the absence of Fas / Fas ligand significantly reduced tissue damage and intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) apoptosis in an in vivo model of T cell-mediated enteropathy. This enteropathy was more severe in IL-10-deficient mice, and this was associated with increased serum levels of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha and an increase in Fas expression on IECs. In this study, we investigated the potential of IL-10 to directly influence Fas expression and Fas -induced IEC apoptosis. Mouse intestinal epithelial cell lines MODE-K and IEC4.1 were cultured with IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, or anti- Fas monoclonal antibody (mAb) in the presence or absence of IL-10. Fas expression and apoptosis were determined by FACScan analysis of phycoerythrin-anti- Fas mAb staining and annexin V staining, respectively. Treatment with a combination of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha induced significant apoptosis. Anti- Fas mAb alone did not induce much apoptosis unless cells were pretreated with IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. These IECs constitutively expressed low levels of Fas, which significantly increased by preincubation of the cells with IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. Treatment with cytokine or cytokine plus anti- Fas mAb increased apoptosis, which correlated with a decreased Fas -associated death domain IL-1-converting enzyme-like inhibitory protein (FLIP) level, increased caspase-8 activity, and subsequently increased caspase-3 activity.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

OTS167 is a potent maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase inhibitor undergoing clinical testing as antineoplastic agent. We aimed to identify the UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) involved in OTS167 metabolism, study the relationship between UGT genetic polymorphisms and hepatic OTS167 glucuronidation, and investigate the inhibitory potential of OTS167 on UGTs. Formation of a single OTS167-glucuronide (OTS167-G) was observed in pooled human liver (HLM) (Km = 3.4  0.2 M), intestinal microsomes (HIM) (Km = 1.7  0.1 M), and UGTs. UGT1A1 (64 l/min/mg) and UGT1A8 (72 l/min/mg) exhibited the highest intrinsic clearances (CLint) for OTS167, followed by UGT1A3 (51 l/min/mg) and UGT1A10 (47 l/min/mg); UGT1A9 was a minor contributor. OTS167 glucuronidation in HLM was highly correlated with thyroxine glucuronidation (r = 0.91, P  0.0001), SN-38 glucuronidation (r = 0.79, P  0.0001), and UGT1A1 mRNA (r = 0.72, P  0.0001). Nilotinib (UGT1A1 inhibitor) and emodin (UGT1A8 and UGT1A10 inhibitor) exhibited the highest inhibitory effects on OTS167-G formation in HLM (68%) and HIM (47%). We hypothesize that OTS167-G is an N-glucuronide according to mass spectrometry.

In the control protocol, NE (0.2 ng.kg-1.min-1) and glucose were infused peripherally to match the arterial NE and blood glucose levels in the Po- NE group. Hepatic sinusoidal NE levels rose approximately 30-fold in the Po- NE group but did not change in the control group. The arterial NE levels did not change significantly in either group. During the portal NE infusion, HGP increased from 1.9 +/- 0.2 to 3.5 +/- 0.4 mg.kg-1.min-1 (15 min; P  0.05) and then gradually fell to 2.4 +/- 0.4 mg.kg-1.min-1 by 3 h.

In cultured rat cerebellar granule cells, glutamate or N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) activation of the NMDA receptor caused a sustained increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) levels ([Ca(2+)](i)), reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and cell death (respective EC(50) values for glutamate were 12, 30, and 38 microM) but no increase in caspase-3 activity. Removal of extracellular Ca(2+) blocked all three glutamate-induced effects, whereas pretreatment with an ROS scavenger inhibited glutamate-induced cell death but had no effect on the [Ca(2+)](i) increase. This indicates that glutamate-induced cell death is attributable to [Ca(2+)](i) increase and ROS generation, and the [Ca(2+)](i) increase precedes ROS generation. Apoptotic cell death was not seen until 24 h after exposure of cells to glutamate. S-nitrosoglutathione abolished glutamate-induced ROS generation and cell death, and only a transient [Ca(2+)](i) increase was seen; similar results were observed with another nitric oxide ( NO ) donor, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, but not with glutathione, which suggests that the effects were caused by NO. The transient [Ca(2+)](i) increase and the abolishment of ROS generation induced by glutamate and S-nitrosoglutathione were still seen in the presence of an ROS scavenger.

Obesity increases the risk for a number of diseases including cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. Excess saturated fatty acids (SFAs) in obesity play a significant role in cardiovascular diseases by activating innate immunity responses. However, the mechanisms by which SFAs activate the innate immune system are not fully known. Here we report that palmitic acid ( PA ), the most abundant circulating SFA, induces myocardial inflammatory injury through the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) accessory protein MD2 in mouse and cell culture experimental models. Md2 knockout mice are protected against PA - and high-fat diet-induced myocardial injury.

Chronic airway inflammation is a characteristic feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Previous studies demonstrated that melatonin had a protective effect against COPD. In addition, silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) was reported to be beneficial in COPD. However, whether SIRT1 is involved in the protective effect of melatonin against COPD remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of melatonin on a rat model of COPD and explored the potential mechanisms. Twenty eight male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to four groups: control group, COPD group, COPD+Mel group and COPD+Mel+EX527 group. Rats were challenged with cigarette smoke and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 28 days with or without melatonin or EX527. The pulmonary function, lung histopathology, inflammatory cells count and the concentration of IL-1 in the BALF as well as the protein expressions of SIRT1, NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1 and ASC in the lung tissues were measured. The results demonstrated that melatonin prevented the development of COPD, which was attributed to the inhibition of airway inflammation by attenuating NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1.

Monoclonal gammopathies (MG) are monoclonal proliferative disorders of B cells at the differentiation stage of Ig production.

We used for the first time transgenic (Tg) mice (Sp6; mu/kappa) to study the origin of MG. In the mu, kappa Tg mice a small proportion of B cells can still produce endogenous Ig M. These cells are of B-1 cell origin. The MG in Tg mice showed a later onset and a lower frequency than those in littermate control mice, mainly due to a four times lower frequency of benign monoclonal gammopathy.

In skeletal muscle the Rab-GTPase-activating protein TBC1D1 has been implicated in the regulation of fatty acid oxidation by an unknown mechanism. We determined whether TBC1D1 altered fatty acid utilization via changes in protein-mediated fatty acid transport and/or selected enzymes regulating mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. We also determined the effects of TBC1D1 on glucose transport and oxidation. Electrotransfection of mouse soleus muscles with TBC1D1 cDNA increased TBC1D1 protein after 2 wk (P0.05), without altering its paralog AS160. TBC1D1 overexpression decreased basal palmitate oxidation (-22%) while blunting 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR)-stimulated palmitate oxidation (-18%). There was a tendency to increase fatty acid esterification (+10 nmolg(-1)60 min(-1), P=0.07), which reflected the reduction in fatty acid oxidation (-12 nmolg(-1)60 min(-1)). Concomitantly, basal (+21%) and AICAR-stimulated glucose oxidation (+8%) were increased in TBC1D1 -transfected muscles relative to their respective controls (P0.05), independent of changes in GLUT4 and glucose transport. The reductions in TBC1D1 -mediated fatty acid oxidation could not be attributed to changes in the transporter FAT/CD36, muscle mitochondrial content, CPT1 expression or the expression and phosphorylation of AS160, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, or AMPK.

Homocysteine is an excitatory amino acid implicated in multiple diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Information on the toxicity of homocysteine in motor neurons is limited and few studies have examined how this toxicity can be modulated. In NSC-34D cells (a hybrid cell line derived from motor neuron-neuroblastoma), homocysteine induces apoptotic cell death in the millimolar range with a TC50 (toxic concentration at which 50% of maximal cell death is achieved) of 2.2 mM, confirmed by activation of caspase 3/7. Induction of apoptosis was independent of short-term reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Methyl Vitamin B12 (MeCbl) and methyl tetrahydrofolate (MTHF), used clinically to treat elevated homocysteine levels, were tested for their ability to reverse homocysteine -mediated motor neuron cell death. MeCbl in the micromolar range was able to provide neuroprotection (2 h pretreatment prior to homocysteine ) and neurorescue (simultaneous exposure with homocysteine ) against millimolar homocysteine with an IC50 (concentration at which 50% of maximal cell death is inhibited) of 0.6 M and 0.4 M, respectively. In contrast, MTHF (up to 10 M) had no effect on homocysteine -mediated cell death. MeCbl inhibited caspase 3/7 activation by homocysteine in a time- and dose-dependent manner, whereas MTHF had no effect.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The results of the Guardian/Expedition trials demonstrate the need for more precisely controlled studies to inhibit Na/H exchange ( NHE1 ) during ischemia /reperfusion. This is because overwhelming evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that myocardial ischemic injury results in part from increases in intracellular Na (Nai) mediated by NHE1 that in turn promote Na/Ca exchanger-mediated increases in intracellular Ca ([Ca]i) and Ca-dependent cell damage. We used a more potent and specific NHE1 inhibitor HOE 694 (HOE) to test whether inhibition of NHE1 during ischemia limits increases in Nai and [Ca]i in newborns. NMR was used to measure pHi, Nai, [Ca]i, and ATP in isolated newborn rabbit hearts. Perfusion pressure, left ventricular developed pressure, and creatine kinase were measured. HOE was added before global ischemia. Results are reported as mean +/- SE. Nai (mEq/kg dry weight) rose from 11.6 +/- 0.9 before ischemia to 114.0 +/- 16.1 at the end of ischemia and recovered to 55.2 +/- 11.8 in the control group. During ischemia and reperfusion, the corresponding values for Nai in the HOE group (63.1 +/- 8.4 and 15.9 +/- 2.5, respectively, P  0.05) were lower than control. In the control group [Ca]i (nM/L) rose from 331 +/- 41 to 1069 +/- 71 and recovered to 814 +/- 51, whereas in the HOE group [Ca]i rose less (P  0.05): 359 +/- 50, 607 +/- 85, and 413 +/- 40, respectively. Total creatine kinase release was significantly reduced in the HOE group. Perfusion pressure and left ventricular developed pressure also recovered significantly better in the HOE group than in the control.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

In the last few years, nitric oxide ( NO ) has emerged as an important intra- and intracellular messenger involved in the control of hypothalamic-pituitary function. The present experiments were undertaken in order to evaluate the pituitary component in the modulatory action of NO on gonadotropin secretion, as well as the second messenger pathway(s) involved. In a first step, we assessed LH and FSH secretion by hemipituitaries incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a potent NO donor, and cyclic guanosin monophosphate (cGMP), the second messenger for a wide range of NO actions. In addition, given that SNP induces the release of NO and cyanide ions, the response to SNP was tested in the presence of hemoglobin (an NO scavenger) or rhodanese + sodium thiosulfate (inactivators of cyanides) in order to ensure that the effects of SNP on gonadotropin secretion were mediated by the release of NO. SNP (10(-4)-10(-3) M) stimulated gonadotropin secretion in our incubation system, whereas cGMP, at all doses tested, was ineffective. Similar results were obtained using dispersed pituitary cells. The stimulatory action of SNP is attributable to its ability to induce NO release since it was blocked by hemoglobin, but preserved after incubation with rhodanese + sodium thiosulfate. In further experiments, we aimed to identify the mechanism(s) underlying SNP-induced gonadotropin secretion.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The aim of this study was to examine the anti-proliferation effect of 5,5-diphenyl-2-thiohydantoin (DPTH), an analogue of antiepileptic drug phenytoin (5,5-diphenylhydantoin), on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and its possible molecular mechanism underlying. Here we demonstrated that DPTH at a range of concentrations (12.5-50 microM) dose- and time-dependently inhibited DNA synthesis and decreased cell number in cultured HUVEC, but not human fibroblasts. DPTH was not cytotoxic at these concentrations. [3H]Thymidine incorporation and flow cytometry analyses demonstrated that treatment of HUVEC with DPTH arrested the cell at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Western blot analysis revealed that the protein level of p21 increased after DPTH treated. In contrast, the protein levels of p27, p53, cyclins A, D1, D3 and E, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)2, and CDK4 in HUVEC were not changed significantly after DPTH treatment. Immunoprecipitation showed that the formations of the CDK2 - p21 and CDK4- p21 complex, but not the CDK2 -p27 and CDK4-p27 complex, were increased in the DPTH-treated HUVEC. Kinase assay further demonstrated that both CDK2 and CDK4 kinase activities were decreased in the DPTH-treated HUVEC. Pretreatment of HUVEC with a p21 antisense oligonucleotide reversed the DPTH-induced inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation into HUVEC.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA, 22:6n-3) and arachidonic acid ( AA, 20:4n-6) serve important roles in perinatal visual and neural development. A neonatal pig model was used to determine if dietary supplementation with DHA and AA at slightly greater concentrations than normally found in human milk would influence fatty acid accretion in retina. One-day-old piglets were assigned to one of four diets (n = 5/group): (i) STD, standard diet containing fat similar to infant formula; (ii) STD + DHA, 0.7% of fatty acids as DHA ; (iii) STD + AA, 0.9% as AA ; and (iv) STD + BOTH, 0.8% as DHA plus 1.0% as AA. After 25 d, fatty acids in retina phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were determined. Supplementation with DHA resulted in approximately twofold increases (P  0.05) in PC- DHA (4.88% in STD vs. 10.03% in STD + DHA and 9.47% in STD + BOTH). Similarly, AA supplementation increased PC- AA 1.3-1.4-fold (4.47% in STD vs. 6.19% in STD + AA and 5.70% in STD + BOTH). For PE, supplementation with either fatty acid or in combination resulted in no significant increases, except for a 1.2-fold increase in DHA for STD + BOTH (32.66%) vs. STD (28.38%). Thus, PC responded to dietary supplementation, with addition of DHA, AA, or BOTH, resulting in increases in respective fatty acids; PE was less responsive, with only STD + BOTH resulting in increased DHA.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 ( PCSK9 ) promotes atherosclerosis by increasing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels through degradation of hepatic LDL receptor (LDLR). Studies have described the systemic effects of PCSK9 on atherosclerosis, but whether PCSK9 has local and direct effects on the plaque is unknown. To study the local effect of human PCSK9 (hPCSK9) on atherosclerotic lesion composition, independently of changes in serum cholesterol levels, we generated chimeric mice expressing hPCSK9 exclusively from macrophages, using marrow from hPCSK9 transgenic (hPCSK9tg) mice transplanted into apoE(-/-) and LDLR(-/-) mice, which were then placed on a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks. We further characterized the effect of hPCSK9 expression on the inflammatory responses in the spleen and by mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPM) in vitro. We found that MPMs from transgenic mice express both murine (m) Pcsk9 and hPCSK9 and that the latter reduces macrophage LDLR and LRP1 surface levels. We detected hPCSK9 in the serum of mice transplanted with hPCSK9tg marrow, but did not influence lipid levels or atherosclerotic lesion size. However, marrow-derived PCSK9 progressively accumulated in lesions of apoE(-/-) recipient mice, while increasing the infiltration of Ly6C(hi) inflammatory monocytes by 32% compared with controls.

Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase ( PKR ) is an interferon-induced protein kinase that plays a central role in the anti-viral process. Due to its pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative action, there is an increased interest in PKR modulation as an anti-tumor strategy. PKR is overexpressed in breast cancer cells; however, the role of PKR in breast cancer cells is unclear. The expression/activity of PKR appears inversely related to the aggressiveness of breast cancer cells. The current study investigated the role of PKR in the motility/migration of breast cancer cells. The activation of PKR by a synthesized dsRNA (PIC) significantly decreased the motility of several breast cancer cell lines (BT474, MDA-MB231 and SKBR3). PIC inhibited cell migration and blocked cell membrane ruffling without affecting cell viability. PIC also induced the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and impaired the formation of lamellipodia. These effects of PIC were reversed by the pretreatment of a selective PKR inhibitor. PIC also activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and its downstream MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2). PIC-induced activation of p38 MAPK and MK2 was attenuated by the PKR inhibitor and the PKR siRNA, but a selective p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) or other MAPK inhibitors did not affect PKR activity, indicating that PKR is upstream of p38 MAPK/MK2. Cofilin is an actin severing protein and regulates membrane ruffling, lamellipodia formation and cell migration.

The effects of blockade of electrical activity by tetrodotoxin in cultures of mouse spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion on immunohistochemically-identified neuronal sub-populations have been investigated. Some spinal cord neuronal types, such as those storing methionine-enkephalin, substance P or calcitonin gene-related peptide were almost totally depleted after inhibition of electrical activity for 4 days. By contrast, putative substance P- and calcitonin gene-related peptide -immunoreactive dorsal root ganglion neurones were not significantly affected by such treatment. Several other neuronal types were reduced by about 30-40% after exposure to tetrodotoxin. The decrement in methionine-enkephalin-, substance P- and calcitonin gene-related peptide -immunoreactive neurones caused by tetrodotoxin was reversible, and, in the case of methionine-enkephalin, could not be elicited after day 30 in culture.

Tumor progression and metastasis may result in part from the selection of cell clones competent for survival, invasion and growth at secondary sites and characterized by loss of growth inhibitory responses, acquisition of increased adhesiveness and enhanced motility and protease expression. Transforming growth factor-beta1 ( TGF-beta1 ) is produced by osteoblasts (OB) in a latent form and is activated by proteases in a cell-dependent manner. We show here that OB conditioned medium (OB CM) modulates Matrigel invasion of a bone metastatic prostate cancer cell line (PC3) and that this effect is blocked by antibody against TGF-beta1 and by uPA/plasmin inhibitors, suggesting that TGF-beta1 can modulate OB-mediated cell recruitment and that PC3 cells can activate TGF-beta1. TGF-beta1 induces uPA and PAI-1 secretion and promotes binding of uPA at the external plasma membrane with increased membrane-associated plasmin activity. Matrix metalloprotease-9 ( MMP-9 ) is induced both in the medium and in the membrane associated form. Moreover, the balance between proteolytic activity and inhibition is crucial in the metastatic event. Indeed, the increment of PAI-1 could have an important regulatory role on the extracellular proteolysis and might explain the decrease of net PA and gelatinolytic activities measured in the medium. In addition, PAI-1 plays a regulative role localizing matrix degradation in some specific sites, such as areas of cell-to-cell or cell-to-ECM contacts.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Infusion of Ang II for two weeks increased ET-1 protein content in aorta (4.7-fold) and femoral artery (1.6-fold) with and without endothelium and in kidneys (3-fold, p0.05) and enhanced functional ECE activity (p0.05). The Ang II -induced increase in tissue ET-1 content and functional ECE activity was completely prevented by LU135252 (p0.05).

We investigated the role of the NO / cGMP system in the vasodilatory response to hypercapnia after cortical spreading depression (CSD) in barbiturate anesthetized rats in vivo. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF). Hypercapnia (arterial pCO2 50-60 mm Hg) increased rCBF by 2.8+/-1.0%/mm Hg (n = 34). Fifteen minutes after CSD, resting rCBF was reduced to 87%, and rCBF response to hypercapnia was abolished (p  0.001, n = 28). Within 1 h after CSD, only little restoration of vascular reactivity occurred. Topical application of the NO -donors S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN1), or spermine/ NO complex (Sperm/ NO ), or of the cell permeable guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate ( cGMP ) analogue 8-Br- cGMP reestablished resting rCBF to values measured before CSD, and reversed CSD-induced attenuation of the cerebrovascular response to hypercapnia. Restoration of resting rCBF to pre-CSD level by the NO -independent vasodilator papaverine had no effect on the attenuated hypercapnic response.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Defective intestinal epithelial tight junction (TJ) barrier has been shown to be a pathogenic factor in the development of intestinal inflammation. Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) is a pleiotropic, pro-inflammatory cytokine which plays an important role in promoting inflammatory response in the gut and in the systemic circulation. Despite its key role in mediating variety inflammatory response, the effect of IL-6 on intestinal epithelial barrier remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of IL-6 on intestinal epithelial TJ barrier and to delineate the intracellular mechanisms involved using in-vitro (filter-grown Caco-2 monolayers) and in-vivo model (mouse intestinal perfusion) systems. Our results indicated that IL-6 causes a site-selective increase in Caco-2 intestinal epithelia TJ permeability, causing an increase in flux of small-sized molecules having molecular radius 4. The size-selective increase in Caco-2 TJ permeability was regulated by protein-specific increase in claudin-2 expression. The IL-6 increase in TJ permeability required activation of JNK signaling cascade. The JNK pathway activation of AP-1 resulted in AP-1 binding to its binding sequence on the claudin-2 promoter region, leading to promoter activation and subsequent increase in claudin-2 gene transcription and protein synthesis and TJ permeability. Our in-vivo mouse perfusion showed that IL-6 modulation of mouse intestinal permeability was also mediated by AP-1 dependent increase in claudin-2 expression.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Adiponectin (APN) is a protein hormone that is primarily derived from adipocytes. It can also be secreted by renal cells. Hypoadiponectinemia has been documented in patients with hyperuricemia, however, whether soluble uric acid ( SUA ) regulates the expression of APN and APN receptor 1 (AdipoR1) in renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (PTECs) remains to be elucidated. The present study investigated the expression of APN and AdipoR1 in cultured PTECs that were exposed to SUA through immunofluorescence and western blot analysis. In addition, SpragueDawley rats with oxonic acidinduced hyperuricemia (HUA) with or without febuxostat treatment were employed as an animal model to measure 24 h urine protein, serum creatinine, urea nitrogen, uric acid and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance. Renal pathology was evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemical staining. APN and AdipoR1 expression in the renal cortex were evaluated by western blotting. The results demonstrated that, in PTECs, the expression of APN and AdipoR1 was constant and increased upon SUA exposure. Similar observations were made within the proximal renal tubules of rats, and the oxonic acidinduced increases in APN and AdipoR1 were offset by febuxostat treatment. Furthermore, SUA treated PTECs exhibited an increase in the expression of NLR family pyrin domaincontaining (NLRP) 3, which was dosedependent.

The pathogenesis of hemorrhage and other local effects induced by the metalloproteinase BaP1, isolated from Bothrops asper venom, was investigated using various in vivo and in vitro models. Upon intramuscular injection in mice BaP1 caused rapid hemorrhage in muscular and adipose tissues. Vital microscopy using mouse cremaster muscle evidenced the formation of multiple hemorrhagic foci of an explosive character, originating from capillaries and small venules. In contrast to crude B. asper venom, which besides hemorrhage also induced myonecrosis and thrombosis, vital microscopy detected only hemorrhage after application of BaP1, during the 40-min observation period. However, histological observation in mouse gastrocnemius muscle evidenced a few areas of limited myonecrosis was followed by an incomplete regenerative response, since regenerating muscle fibers were interspersed with fibrosis in some areas. Metalloproteinase BaP1 was not cytotoxic to human and murine endothelial cells in culture, causing only a mild detachment from the culture plate. BaP1 hydrolyzed types I and IV collagen, fibronectin, and laminin upon incubation with these extracellular matrix proteins in vitro.

AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) is an evolutionary conserved energy-sensing enzyme that regulates cell metabolism. Emerging evidence indicates that AMPK also plays an important role in modulating endothelial cell function. In the present study, we investigated whether AMPK modulates endothelial cell growth. Treatment of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells with the AMPK activators 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1--D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), 6,7-dihydro-4-hydroxy-3-(2'-hydroxy[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)-6-oxo-thieno[2,3-b]pyridine-5-carbonitrile (A-769662), or metformin inhibited cell proliferation and DNA synthesis. The antiproliferative action of AICAR was largely prevented by the adenosine kinase inhibitor 5'-iodotubercidin and mimicked by infecting endothelial cells with an adenovirus expressing constitutively active AMPK. In contrast, pharmacological blockade of endothelial nitric oxide synthase or heme oxygenase-1 activity failed to reverse the inhibition of endothelial cell growth by AICAR. Flow cytometry experiments revealed that pharmacological activation of AMPK arrested endothelial cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, and this was associated with increases in p53 phosphorylation and p53, p21, and p27 protein expression and decreases in cyclin A protein expression and retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation.

The de novo occurrence of germline-activating thyrotropin receptor ( TSHR ) gene mutations has been reported as the cause of sporadic nonautoimmune neonatal hyperthyroidism in eight children. We report the case of an Italian infant girl who presented at birth with severe hyperthyroidism and goiter. Ultrasonografic examination of the infant's thyroid showed a diffuse goiter with a normal echogenic pattern. Serum antithyroglobulin, antithyroperoxidase, and antithyrotropin receptor antibodies were undetectable. Treatment with propylthiouracyl, propranolol, and saturated potassium iodide solution started at 44 days of life with the resolution of thyrotoxic symptoms. Once euthyroidism was achieved, the dose of propylthiouracyl was tapered, but hyperthyroidism recurred. Auxological parameters showed an acceleration of linear growth and bone age. DNA was extracted from peripheral white blood cells of the patient, the sister, and the two parents. All of exon 10 of the TSHR gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subjected to direct sequencing. In the thyrotoxic infant girl, a substitution of cytosine to thymine was detected, changing isoleucine 568 into a threonine (1568T), located in the second extracellular loop. The normal sequence could also be detected, indicating heterozygosis of the mutated allele. This mutation was previously described as a somatic mutation in a patient with toxic thyroid adenoma.

IRBIT binds to and suppresses CaMKII  kinase activity by inhibiting the binding of calmodulin to CaMKII. In addition, we show that mice lacking IRBIT present with elevated catecholamine levels, increased locomotor activity, and social abnormalities. The level of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) phosphorylation by CaMKII, which affects TH activity, was significantly increased in the ventral tegmental area of IRBIT -deficient mice.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Ascorbate ( AsA ) is an antioxidant that can scavenge the reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced when plants encounter stressful conditions. Here, it was revealed by a yeast one-hybrid assay that a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) HD-Zip I family transcription factor, SlHZ24, binds to the promoter of an AsA biosynthetic gene encoding GDP-D-mannose pyrophosphorylase 3 (SlGMP3). Both the transient expression system and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that SlHZ24 binds to a regulatory cis-element in the SlGMP3 promoter, and further overexpression of SlHZ24 in transgenic tomato lines resulted in increased AsA levels. In contrast, suppressing expression of the gene using RNA interference (RNAi) had the opposite effect. These data suggest that SlHZ24 can positively regulate the accumulation of AsA, and in support of this it was shown that SlGMP3 expression increased in the SlHZ24 -overexpressing lines and declined in SlHZ24 -RNAi lines. SlHZ24 also affected the expression of other genes in the D-mannose/L-galactose pathway, such as genes encoding GDP-mannose-3',5'-epimerase 2 (SlGME2), GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase (SlGGP) and SlGMP4. The EMSA indicated that SlHZ24 bound to the promoters of SlGME2 and SlGGP, suggesting multi-targeted regulation of AsA biosynthesis.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Untreated diabetic rats show impaired counterregulation against hypoglycemia. The blunted epinephrine responses are associated with reduced adrenomedullary tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA levels. Recurrent hypoglycemia further impairs epinephrine counterregulation and is also associated with reduced phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase mRNA. This study investigated the adaptations underlying impaired counterregulation in insulin -treated diabetic rats, a more clinically relevant model. We studied the effects of insulin treatment on counterregulatory hormones and adrenal catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes and adaptations after recurrent hypoglycemia. Groups included: normal; diabetic, insulin -treated for 3 wk (DI); and insulin -treated diabetic exposed to seven episodes (over 4 d) of hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia (DI-hypo) or hyperinsulinemic-hyperglycemia (DI-hyper). DI-hyper rats differentiated the effects of hyperinsulinemia from those of hypoglycemia. On d 5, rats from all groups were assessed for adrenal catecholamine-synthesizing enzyme levels or underwent hypoglycemic clamps to examine counterregulatory responses. Despite insulin treatment, fasting corticosterone levels remained increased, and corticosterone responses to hypoglycemia were impaired in DI rats. However, glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and ACTH counterregulatory defects were prevented. Recurrent hypoglycemia in DI-hypo rats blunted corticosterone but, surprisingly, not epinephrine responses. Norepinephrine and ACTH responses also were not impaired, whereas glucagon counterregulation was reduced due to repeated hyperinsulinemia. Insulin treatment prevented decreases in basal TH protein and increased PNMT and dopamine beta-hydroxylase protein.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Due to its high invasiveness, glioblastoma is difficult to treat by surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or any combination therapy. Syndecan binding protein ( SDCBP ), a widely distributed intracellular scaffold protein, has an important role in both physiological and pathological process. In the current work, we have identified target sequences for miR-135a-5p and miR-124-3p in the 3'-untranslated region of the SDCBP mRNA. Therefore, we have investigated the relationship between SDCBP, miR-135a-5p and miR-124-3p in glioblastoma multiforme cells T98G and U87 in vitro and in vivo. Dual luciferase activity assay documented that SDCBP is, in fact, the target of miR-135a-5p, miR-124-3. Western blot, qRT-PCR, proliferation, migration, and invasion assays have demonstrated that of silencing SDCBP or overexpressing miR-135a-5p/miR-124-3p significantly interferes with the malignant properties of glioblastoma cells. In vivo studies have shown that silencing SDCBP or overexpressing miR-135a-5p/miR-124-3p result in a marked decrease of tumor size and prolong life of tumor-bearing mice.

Higher HSA-specific IgA titers were also found in the mucosal secretions (saliva, feces and nasal) of the steroid treated animals, especially in the 1,25( OH )(2)D(3) group. Furthermore, 1,25( OH )(2)D(3) and DHEA increased the number of antigen-specific IgA and IgG antibody-secreting cells in the local draining lymph nodes, but only low numbers were detected in lymph nodes draining the mucosa. DHEA decreased the IgM serum response and had a tendency to enhance the IgG2 and IgG serum responses. Strong and comparable IgG, IgG1 and IgG2 serum responses were seen in all groups. Combining both steroids did not result in a higher IgA serum response.

Exposure of pancreatic beta-cells to interleukin-1 beta ( IL-1 beta ) alters their protein expression and phenotype. Previous work has shown that IL-1 beta inhibited proinsulin conversion in rat islets, but the mechanism of this inhibition remained unknown. To investigate this phenomenon further, we examined purified rat beta-cells for IL-1 beta -induced inhibition of proinsulin conversion and nitric oxide (NO)-dependency of this inhibitory process. Rat beta-cells were cultured for 24 h with or without IL-1 beta and the inducible-nitric-oxide-synthase (iNOS) inhibitor N(G)-methyl-L-arginine (NMA). Exposure to IL-1 beta suppressed proinsulin -1 and proinsulin -2 synthesis by more than 50 %. Conversion of both proinsulin isoforms was also delayed. The suppressive effects of IL-1 beta on proinsulin synthesis and conversion were prevented by addition of NMA. Exposure to IL-1 beta also decreased the expression of the proinsulin convertase (PC) PC2. This decrease in PC2 expression was NO-dependent.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Epidemiological data indicates increased risk of infant acute leukemia involving MLL gene aberrations with use of oral contraceptives. To determine whether estrogens might be implicated, we examined the effect of estradiol (E2) or 4-OH-E2 in an in vitro model of translocation susceptibility. Genomic DNA from the TK6 human lymphoblastoid cell line was screened by ligation mediated PCR and inverse PCR at a rearrangement hot spot within the MLL breakpoint cluster region to detect DNA aberrations. An increase in DNA double strand breaks was observed within this region after exposure to either E2 or 4-OH-E2. An increase in the frequency of MLL translocations was only found after exposure to E2.

The skeletal muscle mitochondrial uncoupling protein-3 (UCP3) promotes substrate oxidation, but direct evidence for its metabolic role is lacking. Here, we show that UCP3 overexpression in cultured human muscle cells decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (DYm). Despite this, the ATP content was not significantly decreased compared with control cells, whereas ADP content was reduced and thus the ATP/ADP ratio raised. This finding was contrasts with the effect caused by the chemical protonophoric uncoupler, CCCP, which lowered DYm, ATP, and the ATP/ADP ratio. UCP3-overexpression enhanced oxidation of oleate, regardless of the presence of glucose, whereas etomoxir, which blocks fatty acid entry to mitochondria, suppressed the UCP3 effect. Glucose oxidation was stimulated in UCP3-overexpressing cells, but this effect was inhibited by oleate. UCP3 caused weak increase of both 2-Deoxyglucose uptake and glycolytic rate, which differed from the marked stimulation by CCCP.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Microcystic adnexal carcinoma is a locally aggressive sweat gland carcinoma characterized by its infiltrative growth and histopathologic overlap with benign adnexal tumors, often posing challenges to both diagnosis and management. Understanding the molecular underpinnings of microcystic adnexal carcinoma may allow for more accurate diagnosis and identify potential targetable oncogenic drivers. We characterized 18 microcystic adnexal carcinomas by targeted, multiplexed PCR-based DNA next-generation sequencing of the coding sequence of over 400 cancer-relevant genes. The majority of cases had relatively few (8) prioritized somatic mutations, and lacked an ultraviolet (UV) signature. The most recurrent mutation was TP53 inactivation in four (22%) tumors. Frame-preserving insertions affecting the kinase domain of JAK 1 were detected in three (17%) cases, and were nonoverlapping with TP53 mutations. Seven (39%) cases demonstrated copy number gain of at least one oncogene. By immunohistochemistry, p53 expression was significantly higher in microcystic adnexal carcinomas with TP53 mutations compared with those without such mutations and syringomas. Similarly, phospho-STAT3 expression was significantly higher in microcystic adnexal carcinomas harboring JAK 1 kinase insertions compared with those with wild-type JAK 1 and syringomas.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We investigate activation mechanisms of native TRPC1/C5/C6 channels (termed TRPC1 channels) by stimulation of endothelin-1 ( ET -1) receptor subtypes in freshly dispersed rabbit coronary artery myocytes using single channel recording and immunoprecipitation techniques. ET -1 evoked non-selective cation channel currents with a unitary conductance of 2.6 pS which were not inhibited by either ET (A) or ET (B) receptor antagonists, respectively BQ-123 and BQ788, when administered separately. However, in the presence of both antagonists, ET -1-evoked channel activity was abolished indicating that both ET (A) and ET (B) receptor stimulation activate this conductance. Stimulation of both ET (A) and ET (B) receptors evoked channel activity which was inhibited by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor chelerythrine and by anti-TRPC1 antibodies indicating that activation of both receptor subtypes causes TRPC1 channel activation by a PKC-dependent mechanism. ET (A) receptor-mediated TRPC1 channel activity was selectively inhibited by phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI-3-kinase) inhibitors wortmannin (50 nM) and PI-828 and by antibodies raised against phosphoinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate ( PIP (3)), the product of PI-3-kinase-mediated phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate ( PIP (2)). Moreover, exogenous application of diC8- PIP (3) stimulated PKC-dependent TRPC1 channel activity.

Within the central nervous system, acetylcholine (ACh) functions as a state-dependent modulator at a range of sites, but its signaling mechanisms are yet unclear. Cholinergic projections from the brain stem and basal forebrain innervate the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the master circadian clock in mammals, and cholinergic stimuli adjust clock timing. Cholinergic effects on clock state require muscarinic receptor-mediated activation of guanylyl cyclase and cGMP synthesis, although the effect is indirect. Here we evaluate the roles of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO), major activators of cGMP synthesis. Both heme oxygenase 2 (HO-2) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), enzymes that synthesize CO and NO, respectively, are expressed in rat SCN, with HO-2 localized to the central core of the SCN, whereas nNOS is a punctate plexus. Hemin, an activator of HO-2, but not the NO donor, SNAP, mimicked cholinergic effects on circadian timing. Selective inhibitors of HO fully blocked cholinergic clock resetting, whereas NOS inhibition partially attenuated this effect. Hemoglobin, an extracellular scavenger of both NO and CO, blocked cholinergic stimulation of cGMP synthesis, whereas l-NAME, a specific inhibitor of NOS, had no effect on cholinergic stimulation of cGMP, but decreased the cGMP basal level.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We report here that (1) exposure to C2-ceramide (cer) rarely increases OLG Cai, whereas sphingosine elicits sustained increase in Cai; (2) cer causes OLG depolarization, an effect mimicked by sphingosine-1-phosphate but not by sphingosine; and (3) cer, but not its inactive analog dihydroceramide, inhibits OLG IKir.

The peptide galanin is synthesized within and secreted from specific cell types of the rat anterior pituitary gland. The small size of the rat anterior pituitary gland is somewhat limiting for studying the regulation of galanin gene expression and peptide synthesis/secretion. We examined the mammotropic rat pituitary tumor MtTW-10 as a possible model system to study galanin. The objectives of this study were to 1) determine if galanin is secreted from MtTW-10 cells in vitro in a regulated manner, 2) characterize the molecular forms of immunoreactive galanin secreted by MtTW-10 cells, and 3) assess whether galanin gene expression in MtTW-10 tumors is regulated by estradiol. MtTW-10 pituitary tumors were transplanted to female Wistar-Furth rats that were implanted with estradiol -filled capsules. Cells were harvested from the MtTW-10 tumors and cultured for 4 days. When examined by electron microscopy, the MtTW-10 cells maintained in culture were irregular in shape with microvilli on their surface and contained numerous large secretory granules. Immunoreactive galanin, PRL, and GH were secreted from the cells in a time-dependent fashion during static incubations. LH, ACTH, and TSH were undetectable in the culture medium. Somatostatin (10 and 100 nM) inhibited galanin, PRL, and GH release in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, dopamine, TRH, LH-releasing hormone, CRH, and GH-releasing hormone at concentrations of 10-100 nM failed to alter hormone secretion. Only high concentrations of dopamine (1 microM) inhibited the secretion of galanin, PRL, and GH. HPLC fractionation of peptides secreted by MtTW-10 cells cultures showed that approximately 84% of the galanin immunoreactivity coeluted with synthetic rat galanin.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Degradation of stromal collagens in the extracellular matrix is mediated largely by matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1; collagenase-1), and high constitutive levels of MMP-1 in breast cancer correlate with a poor prognosis and invasive disease. MMP-1 expression is, in part, controlled by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway(s), which may target several activator protein-1 (AP-1) and polyoma enhancing activity-3/E26 virus (PEA3/ETS) sites within the promoter. An additional ETS site in the MMP-1 promoter is conferred by a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at -1607 bp, when two guanines (5'-GGAT-3'; '2G allele/SNP') are present instead of one guanine (5'-GAT-3'; '1G allele/SNP'). This SNP is adjacent to an AP-1 site at -1602 bp, and in the presence of the 2G allele (ETS site), these sites cooperate to induce higher levels of transcription. ERK 1/2 is one component of the MAPK pathway and is constitutively active in MCF-7/ADR breast cancer cells, which are 1G/2G heterozygotes. This study demonstrates that when these cells are treated with PD098059, an ERK-specific inhibitor, MMP-1 mRNA levels are significantly decreased, suggesting that high constitutive expression of MMP-1 in these cells results from continuous ERK 1/2 activation. Using transient transfection, we determined that this signaling pathway targets different AP-1/ETS sites, depending upon which allele is present. Furthermore, in these cells, the AP-1 site at -1602 bp enhances transcription in the presence of the 2G SNP, but represses transcription from the 1G SNP. Finally, inhibiting ERK signaling and MMP-1 expression blocks type I collagen degradation and reduces the invasive ability of the MCF-7/ADR cells.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Pretreatment with taxifolin (1-100 microM) concentration-dependently diminished fMLP- or (PMA)-induced Mac-1-dependent firm adhesion and upexpression of surface Mac-1. Mobilisation of intracellular calcium and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) signal the upexpression of Mac-1 and firm adhesion by neutrophils. Taxifolin impeded the calcium influx induced by fMLP (a receptor-mediated activator) or AlF(4)(-) (a G protein -mediated activator). Taxifolin also effectively inhibited the fMLP- or PMA-induced ROS production with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) less than 10microM, possibly through impairing the activation of NADPH oxidase, a major ROS-generating enzyme in neutrophils, by restricting the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and protein kinase C (PKC).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Moreover, high glucose ( HG ) decreased H3K9me3 and Suv39h1 levels in some cells. Thus, we studied the roles of Suv39h1 in HG -induced effects in MES13 (mouse mesangial) cells. We found that HG, chaetocin (a Suv39h1 inhibitor) and Suv39h1 siRNA decreased Suv39h1 while increasing fibronectin and p21(WAF1) protein levels. HG increased mRNA while chaetocin increased transcription of fibronectin and p21(WAF1)genes. Both HG and chaetocin decreased histone H3K9me3 levels at the promoters of fibronectin and p21(WAF1) genes. Additionally, Suv39h1 overexpression attenuated HG -induced fibronectin and p21(WAF1) mRNA and protein expressions while attenuating HG -induced cell hypertrophy. Suv39h1 overexpression also attenuated HG -suppressed histone H3K9me3 levels at the promoters of fibronectin and p21(WAF1) genes. Moreover, LY294002 or the dominant-negative phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) mutant (p85) attenuated HG -decreased Suv39h1 and HG -induced fibronectin and p21(WAF1) protein expressions.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The uptake of hyaluronan ( HYA ) labeled with 3H in its acetyl group was measured in cultured liver endothelial cells from normal rats and from rats previously treated with sublethal doses of Escherichia coli endotoxin (ET). Replicate cultures were also exposed to recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ), interleukin-1 (IL-1) or interferon-gamma for 1 to 3 h before the measurement of hyaluronan uptake. Under all conditions, HYA was absorbed by endothelial cells at rates consistent with receptor-mediated absorption. In cells exposed to HYA 20 h after isolation, rate of uptake was less than half the rate in cells exposed 6 or 7 h after isolation. Cellular uptake of HYA was neither reduced nor enhanced by any of the treatments with cytokines. Prior exposure of the cell donors to ET caused a three-fold increase in their plasma HYA but did not alter the subsequent rate of cellular HYA uptake in vitro, either with or without added treatment with TNF-alpha or IL-1.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

A pressure relief balloon has been recommended as one way to decrease catheter-related pulmonary artery rupture (PAR). There are approximately 1 to 2 PARs per 1,000 pulmonary artery catheter ( PAC ) insertions, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. A new pressure relief balloon (PRB) introduced by Biosensors International (Singapore) was studied for its efficacy in increasing safety during PAC flotation balloon (FB) inflations. Ten human placentae were used for the experiment. The Biosensors PAC s and the commonly used Baxter-Edwards (Irvine, CA) catheters were placed in placental veins and their FBs were gradually inflated with a maximum of 1.5 mL of air. Data revealed that PRBs consistently inflated when resistance was met by FBs and inflation pressure reached 1,000 mmHg. When PRBs were removed, the FBs inflated asymmetrically and distended beyond the catheter lumen or protruded through the vessel wall, causing bleeding upon deflation. Without the PRB, pressures reached up to 1,700 mmHg. In addition, the PRB gave visual evidence of resistance to the FB.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Visceral adipose tissue-derived serine protease inhibitor (Vaspin) is an adipocytokine that has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects and inhibits apoptosis under diabetic conditions. This study was designed to investigate the impact of vaspin on autophagy in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)--induced injury in cardiomyocytes and its cardioprotective effects in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). H9C2 cells were treated with TNF- with or without vaspin in vitro. Tumor necrosis factor- treatment inhibited autophagy and promoted apoptosis in H9C2 cells after stimulating for 24 hours. Pretreatment with vaspin significantly mitigated apoptosis induced by TNF- partly because of augment effects of vaspin on autophagy as demonstrated by a higher ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I, higher expression of Beclin-1, and increased autophagosomes formation. Furthermore, the AKT agonist IGF-1 significantly reversed the effect of vaspin on autophagy. In vivo DCM model was also developed by treating rats with streptozotocin followed by intraperitoneal injection with vaspin. In DCM rats, upregulation of vaspin reversed cardiac dysfunction, as identified by increased left ventricular ejection fractions and fractional shortening levels, a higher Em/Am ratio, and lower levels of TNF-, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and creatine kinase-myocardial isoenzyme.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Detailed swimming kinematics of the yellowtail kingfish Seriola lalandi were investigated after unilateral ablation of superficial neuromasts ( SN s). Most kinematic variables, such as tail-beat frequency, stride length, caudal fin-beat amplitude and propulsive wavelength, were unaffected but lateral amplitude at the tip of the snout (A0 ) was significantly increased in SN -disrupted fish compared with sham-operated controls. In addition, the orientation of caudal fin-tip relative to the overall swimming direction of SN -disrupted fish was significantly deflected (two-fold) in comparison with sham-operated control fish. In some fish, SN disruption also led to a phase distortion of the propulsive body-wave. These changes would be expected to increase both hydrodynamic drag and thrust production which is consistent with the finding that SN -disrupted fish had to generate significantly greater thrust power when swimming at 13 fork lengths (LF ) s(-1). In particular, hydrodynamic drag would increase as a result of any increase in rotational (yaw) perturbation and sideways slip resulting from the sensory disturbance.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Protein kinase A (PKA) activity is pivotal for proper functioning of the human heart, and its dysregulation has been implicated in a variety of cardiac pathologies. PKA regulatory subunit 1 (R1, encoded by the PRKAR1A gene) is highly expressed in the heart, and controls PKA kinase activity by sequestering PKA catalytic subunits. Patients with PRKAR1A mutations are often diagnosed with Carney complex (CNC) in early adulthood, and may die later in life from cardiac complications such as heart failure. However, it remains unknown whether PRKAR1A deficiency interferes with normal heart development. Here, we showed that left ventricular mass was reduced in young CNC patients with PRKAR1A mutations or deletions. Cardiac-specific heterozygous ablation of PRKAR1A in mice increased cardiac PKA activity, and reduced heart weight and cardiomyocyte size without altering contractile function at 3 months of age. Silencing of PRKAR1A, or stimulation with the PKA activator forskolin completely abolished 1-adrenergic receptor-mediated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Mechanistically, depletion of PRKAR1A provoked PKA-dependent inactivating phosphorylation of Drp1 at S637, leading to impaired mitochondrial fission. Pharmacologic inhibition of Drp1 with Mdivi 1 diminished hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Cerebrovascular injury is the most prevalent human cerebrovascular disease and frequently results in ischemic stroke. Simvastatin may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of patients with cerebrovascular injury. The present study aimed to investigate the efficacy of and the potential mechanisms regulated by simvastatin in a rat model of ischemiareperfusion (I/R)induced cerebrovascular injury. Cerebrovascular injury model rats were established and were subsequently treated with simvastatin or a vehicle control following I/R injury. Cell damage, neurological functions and neuronal apoptosis were examined, as well as the nuclear factor ( NF )Bmediated myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88)/tollinterleukin1 receptor domaincontaining adapter molecule 1 (TRIF) signaling pathway following simvastatin treatment. The results of the present study demonstrated that simvastatin treatment led to a reduction in cell damage, improvement of neurological functions and decreased neuronal apoptosis compared with vehicletreated I/R model rats, 14 days posttreatment.

Recent data indicate that sustained elevations in plasma insulin suppress the mRNA for IRS-2, a component of the insulin signaling pathway in liver, and that this deficiency contributes to hepatic insulin resistance and inappropriate gluconeogenesis. Here, we use nuclear run-on assays to show that insulin inhibits transcription of the IRS-2 gene in the livers of intact rats. Insulin also inhibited transcription of a reporter gene driven by the human IRS-2 promoter that was transfected into freshly isolated rat hepatocytes. The human promoter contains a heptanucleotide sequence, TGTTTTG, that is identical to the insulin response element (IRE) identified previously in the promoters of insulin -repressed genes.

The synthesis of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4-phosphate and PI 4,5-bisphosphate in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is stimulated by glucose. PI 4-kinase ( ATP :phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.67) catalyzes the committed step in the synthesis of these phosphoinositides. Previous studies have suggested that the glucose effect on phosphoinositide synthesis is mediated by cellular levels of ATP and ADP and by the RAS/cAMP pathway. Using purified preparations of the membrane-associated 45- and 55-kDa forms of PI 4-kinase, we examined the regulation of these activities by nucleotides and cAMP-dependent protein kinase. MgADP was a potent inhibitor of both forms of the enzyme. Detailed kinetic analyses of the 45- and 55-kDa enzymes using Triton X-100/PI-mixed micelles showed that MgADP was a competitive inhibitor (Ki = 0.14 and 0.25 mM, respectively) with respect to MgATP and a noncompetitive inhibitor (Ki = 1.3 and 0.9 mM, respectively) with respect to PI. The Ki values for MgADP were about 2-fold lower than the Km values the enzymes have for their substrate MgATP and about 2-fold lower than the cellular concentration of ADP. The 45- and 55-kDa forms of PI 4-kinase activity were regulated differentially by CTP, an important nucleotide involved in phospholipid biosynthesis. Whereas the 55-kDa PI 4-kinase was inhibited by CTP, the 45-kDa enzyme was unaffected by CTP.

Treatment with PTH (1-34) may be superior to conventional therapy but is contraindicated in children, and long-term effects on the skeleton are unknown. The patient is a 20-yr-old female with ADH treated with PTH continuously since 6 yr and 2 mo of age. A bone biopsy was obtained for histomorphometry and quantitative backscattered electron imaging (qBEI). Her data were compared with one age-, sex-, and length of hypoparathyroidism-matched control not on PTH and two sex-matched ADH controls before and after 1 yr of PTH. The patient's growth was normal. Hypercalciuria and hypermagnesuria persisted despite normal or subnormal serum calcium and magnesium levels. Nephrocalcinosis, without evidence of impaired renal function, developed by 19 yr of age. Cancellous bone volume was dramatically elevated in the patient and in ADH controls after 1 yr of PTH. BMD distribution (BMDD) by qBEI of the patient and ADH controls was strikingly shifted toward lower mineralization compared with the non-ADH control.

High dietary potassium stimulates the renal expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenase 2C23, which metabolizes arachidonic acid (AA). Because the AA metabolite 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid ( 11,12-EET ) can inhibit the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the cortical collecting duct, we tested whether dietary potassium modulates ENaC function. High dietary potassium increased 11,12-EET in the isolated cortical collecting duct, an effect mimicked by inhibiting the angiotensin II type I receptor with valsartan. In patch-clamp experiments, a high potassium intake or treatment with valsartan enhanced AA-induced inhibition of ENaC, an effect mediated by a CYP-epoxygenase-dependent pathway. Moreover, high dietary potassium and valsartan each augmented the inhibitory effect of 11,12-EET on ENaC. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry showed that the rate of EET conversion to dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHET) was lower in renal tissue obtained from rats on a high-potassium diet than from those on a control diet, but this was not a result of altered expression of soluble epoxide hydrolase ( sEH ). Instead, suppression of sEH activity seemed to be responsible for the 11,12-EET -mediated enhanced inhibition of ENaC in animals on a high-potassium diet. Patch-clamp experiments demonstrated that 11,12-DHET was a weak inhibitor of ENaC compared with 11,12-EET, whereas 8,9- and 14,15-DHET were not. Furthermore, inhibition of sEH enhanced the 11,12-EET -induced inhibition of ENaC similar to high dietary potassium.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Homozygous Brattleboro rats, on the other hand, developed none of the manifestations of papillary necrosis (that is, animals with central diabetes insipidus were protected completely from the nephrotoxic effects of BEA ). They adapted normally to a zero sodium diet. Chronic administration of vasopressin to homozygous Brattleboro rats fully restored the toxic effects of BEA. Lowering urinary concentrating ability by inducing a water diuresis in Sprague-Dawley rats completely protected against BEA -induced papillary necrosis. Decreasing papillary solute concentration by furosemide or increasing urine flow after abrupt withdrawal of vasopressin to homozygous Brattleboro rats did not protect against BEA -induced papillary necrosis.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] on TSH and the 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) analogue 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)- cAMP -stimulated cell growth and iodide uptake were studied in a rat thyroid cell line (FRTL-5). 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited both TSH and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)- cAMP -induced cell proliferation with the maximum effect at 100 nmol/L. The inhibitory effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (10 nmol/L) on TSH and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)- cAMP -stimulated iodide uptake was observed after 2 days of incubation, and the effect was maximal after 4 days. The inhibition was dose-dependent and maximal at 100 nmol/L 1,25-(OH)2D3. 1,25-(OH)2D3 (10 nmol/L, 4 days) increased the median concentrations of TSH required to stimulate both cAMP production and iodide uptake half-maximally by 124 and 187%, respectively, whereas the median 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)- cAMP concentration was not changed. Lineweaver-Burke plots revealed that 1,25-(OH)2D3 reduced the Vmax of the sodium-driven iodide carriers to 30% of the control cells without effect on the Km.

Catecholamine regulates myocardial glucose use. However, the effect of inhaled anesthetics on myocardial glucose transport stimulated by catecholamine is unclear. We studied the effect of halothane and sevoflurane on uptake of 2-deoxyglucose stimulated by norepinephrine in neonatal cardiomyocytes and the mechanism that modulates glucose transport. We studied the effects of halothane and sevoflurane on norepinephrine (NE)-stimulated glucose uptake and the effects of halothane and sevoflurane on glucose uptake stimulated by W7 (a calcium releasing agent), phorbol 12 myristate-13-acetate (a protein kinase C agonist), and LiCl. Sevoflurane decreased NE-stimulated glucose uptake from 63.7 +/- 7.0 to 41.2 +/- 3.7 pmol h(-1) mg protein(-1), and halothane also attenuated NE-stimulated glucose uptake to 37.8 +/- 5.7 pmol h(-1) mg protein(-1). W7 at 10 micromol/L increased glucose uptake from 16.4 +/- 1.4 to 41.2 +/- 3. 4 pmol h(-1) mg protein(-1).

Neuroinflammation is involved in the death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) after optic nerve injury. The purpose of this study was to determine whether systemic simvastatin can suppress neuroinflammation in the optic nerve and rescue RGCs after the optic nerve is crushed. Simvastatin or its vehicle was given through an osmotic minipump beginning one week prior to the crushing. Immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR were used to determine the degree of neuroinflammation on day 3 after the crushing. The density of RGCs was determined in Tuj-1 stained retinal flat mounts on day 7. The effect of simvastain on the TNF--induced NF-B activation was determined in cultured optic nerve astrocytes. On day 3, CD68-positive cells, most likely microglia/macrophages, were accumulated at the crushed site. Phosphorylated NF-B was detected in some astrocytes at the border of the lesion where the immunoreactivity to MCP-1 was intensified. There was an increase in the mRNA levels of the CD68 (11.4-fold), MCP-1 (22.6-fold), ET-1 (2.3-fold), GFAP (1.6-fold), TNF- (7.0-fold), and iNOS (14.8-fold) genes on day 3. Systemic simvastatin significantly reduced these changes. The mean  SD number of RGCs was 1816.3232.6/mm(2) (n = 6) in the sham controls which was significantly reduced to 831.4202.5/mm(2) (n = 9) on day 7 after the optic nerve was crushed. This reduction was significantly suppressed to 1169.2201.3/mm(2) (P = 0.01, Scheffe; n = 9) after systemic simvastatin.

Activation of cytoskeleton regulator Rho-kinase during ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) plays a major role in I/R injury and apoptosis. Since Rho-kinase is a negative regulator of the pro-survival phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase)/Akt pathway, we hypothesized that inhibition of Rho-kinase can prevent I/R-induced endothelial cell apoptosis by maintaining PI3-kinase/Akt activity and that protective effects of Rho-kinase inhibition are facilitated by prevention of F-actin rearrangement. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were subjected to 1 h of simulated ischemia and 1 or 24 h of simulated reperfusion after treatment with Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632, PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, F-actin depolymerizers cytochalasinD and latrunculinA and F-actin stabilizer jasplakinolide. Intracellular ATP levels decreased following I/R. Y-27632 treatment reduced I/R-induced apoptosis by 31% (P  0.01) and maintained Akt activity. Both effects were blocked by co-treatment with wortmannin. Y-27632 treatment prevented the formation of F-actin bundles during I/R. Similar results were observed with cytochalasinD treatment. In contrast, latrunculinA and jasplakinolide treatment did not prevent the formation of F-actin bundles during I/R and had no effect on I/R-induced apoptosis. Apoptosis and Akt activity were inversely correlated (R (2) = 0.68, P  0.05).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

To gain insight into the mechanism underlying the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced changes in responsiveness to TRH and in the numbers of TRH receptors ( TRH-R s) in the pituitary, we investigated the transcription al regulation by EGF of the TRH-R gene in GH4C1 cells. Northern blot analyses and binding studies revealed that EGF reduced both TRH binding and TRH-R mRNA levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner, while no significant changes were observed in beta-actin mRNA levels. Addition of actinomycin D caused an acute increase in the basal TRH-R mRNA level, and the rate of decrease of the TRH-R mRNA was identical in control and EGF-treated groups, suggesting that the stability of the TRH-R mRNA was not significantly affected in EGF-treated cells. Incubation with cycloheximide also induced an increase in the basal TRH-R mRNA level and completely reversed the EGF-induced reduction of TRH-R mRNA levels. Furthermore, a nuclear run-on assay demonstrated that the rate of transcription of the TRH-R gene was significantly inhibited in cells treated with EGF.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
We conclude that (1) EGF decreases the expression of the <el> TRH-R <le> mRNA largely by reducing its rate of <re> transcription <er>, and this action requires the synthesis of new proteins, and (2) inhibitors of protein and RNA synthesis cause a significant increase in the basal <el> TRH-R <le> mRNA level, suggesting that there may be a short-lived protein suppressing the <el> TRH-R <le> mRNA level in the pituitary. negative----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

During HIV infection various cytokines are overproduced in early stages, whereas in advanced disease cytokines of the T helper 1 type (e.g. interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)) are selectively deficient. During antigenic stimulation, the production of type-1 cytokines is enhanced by IL-12, secreted by antigen-presenting cells (APC) after their interaction with activated CD4 T cells. Two factors are essential in this process: priming APC with IFN-gamma and triggering the CD40 receptor on APC by CD40 ligand ( CD40 L). In view of the importance of this pathway, we compared its regulation in HIV-infected and control subjects. After cross-linking of the T cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex, the proportional expression of CD40 L was similar on CD4+ T cells from controls and from patients with high circulating CD4 T counts (> 500/microl), but CD40 L up-regulation was significantly reduced in patients with more advanced disease. Simultaneous triggering of the costimulatory receptor CD28 on T cells through its natural ligand CD80 partly corrected the CD40 L defect in patients with intermediate CD4 T counts (200-500), but not in AIDS patients. Early production of IFN-gamma was preserved in lymphocytes from HIV+ patients. The expression of CD40 on peripheral monocytes from HIV+ subjects was increased in a disease stage-related fashion. Stimulation of mononuclear cells through cell-bound CD40 L and soluble IFN-gamma induced significantly higher IL-12 in cultures from patients with > 200 circulating CD4 T cells, whereas IL-12 production was marginally decreased in cultures from patients with  200 CD4 T cells, compared with healthy control cultures.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are increased in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and have been implicated as mediators of intestinal inflammation. We investigated the hypothesis that antioxidants with diverse properties attenuate disease progression in a murine dextran sodium sulfate ( DSS )-induced colitis model. These antioxidants were (A) S-adenosylmethionine, a glutathione (GSH) precursor; (B) green tea polyphenols, a well-known antioxidant; and (C) 2(R,S)-n-propylthiazolidine-4(R)-carboxylic acid (PTCA), a cysteine prodrug, involved in GSH biosynthesis. BALB/c mice were divided into four groups and provided with the above mentioned antioxidants or the vehicle incorporated into chow. The animals were further divided into two subgroups and given normal drinking water (control) or water supplemented with DSS (to induce colitis ), and the progression of the disease was studied. DSS -treated mice developed severe colitis as shown by bloody diarrhea, weight loss and pathological involvement (P.001). However, all the antioxidants significantly improved diarrhea and colon lesions (P.01), and increased body weights (P.05). Hematocrits were significantly less affected in DSS -treated animals receiving antioxidants (P.01). Colon lengths were significantly decreased due to mucosal inflammation in DSS -treated animals, but antioxidant therapy normalized this pathological finding (P.001). The blood level of reduced GSH was decreased in DSS -treated mice (P.05) and returned to normal when treated with antioxidants. Serum amyloid A (acute phase protein; P=.0015) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha; pro-inflammatory cytokine; P.01) were significantly increased in DSS -treated animals (161+/-40 pg/ml) and improved with antioxidant treatment (P.01).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The PTH receptor (PTH1R) activates multiple signaling pathways, including extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 ( ERK 1/2). The role of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) transactivation in ERK 1/2 activation by PTH in distal kidney cells, a primary site of PTH action, was characterized. ERK 1/2 phosphorylation was stimulated by PTH and blocked by the EGFR inhibitor, AG1478. Upon PTH stimulation, metalloprotease cleavage of membrane-bound heparin-binding fragment (HB-EGF) induced EGFR transactivation of ERK. Conditioned media from PTH-treated distal kidney cells activated ERK in HEK-293 cells. AG1478 added to HEK-293 cells ablated transactivation by conditioned media. HB-EGF directly activated ERK 1/2 in HEK-293 cells. Pretreatment of distal kidney cells with the metalloprotease inhibitor GM-6001 abolished transactivation of ERK 1/2 by PTH. The role of the PTH1R COOH terminus in PTX-sensitive ERK 1/2 activation was characterized in HEK-293 cells transfected with wild-type PTH1R, with a PTH1R mutated at its COOH terminus, or with PTH1R truncated at position 480. PTH stimulated ERK by wild-type, mutated and truncated PTH1Rs 21-, 27- and 57-fold, respectively. Thus, the PTH1R COOH terminus exerts an inhibitory effect on ERK activation.

Angiotensin II ( ANG II )-induced interleukin (IL)-6 synthesis requires NAD(P)H-oxidase-derived superoxide anions. Since NAD(P)H-oxidase activation by cytokines involves 5-lipoxygenase (LOX)-derived leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) formation, we postulated that LTB(4) is involved in the ANG II -dependent NAD(P)H-oxidase activation. Therefore, 5-LOX expression and LTB(4) formation following ANG II (100nM) stimulation were determined in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC). Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-formation and IL-6 mRNA expression were analyzed following ANG II and LTB(4) (0.6 microM) stimulation. 5-LOX mRNA and protein were detected in SMC. ANG II -induced LTB(4) formation at 2.5min and was followed by an increase in ROS-formation and IL-6 mRNA expression. Blockade of 5-LOX by MK886 (200nM) abrogated LTB(4)-formation, ROS-formation, and IL-6 mRNA expression.

PGBx is a synthetic, oligomeric derivative of prostaglandin B1 that has been shown to protect rat liver mitochondria from the deleterious effects of aging. In fresh mitochondria, PGBx inhibits reactions involving the F1F0-ATPase. It prevents the stimulation of respiration by ADP and inhibits ATP-driven Ca2+ transport. It has no effect, however, on Ca2+-stimulated respiration and associated proton movements, or on respiration-driven Ca2+ transport, indicating that PGBx is not an inhibitor of the electron transport chain. The ATPase activity of submitochondrial particles is inhibited by PGBx with mixed type kinetics in which both Km and V are affected.

Lung transplantation is hampered by bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), although recently azithromycin treatment has a published response rate of about 42% in patients with established BOS. We linked this improvement to a reduction in airway neutrophilia and IL8. In the present study, we further investigated the intracellular mechanisms of azithromycin, looking at the possible involvement of mitogen-activated-protein kinases (MAPK) and oxidative stress. Simultaneously, currently used immunosuppressive agents were investigated. Human primary airway smooth muscle cells were stimulated with IL17 and incubated with increasing concentrations of steroids, immunosuppressive agents (tacrolimus, cyclosporine and rapamycin) or macrolides (erythromycin and azithromycin). We measured supernatant IL8 protein, 8-isoprostane and cell lysate MAPK. IL17 -induced IL8 production was decreased by both erythromycin and azithromycin. In nonstimulated condition, IL8 production only increased at the highest dose of azithromycin.

It has been recently shown that beta-adrenergic receptors are able to activate phospholipase C via the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-binding protein Epac. This new interconnection may participate in isoproterenol (Iso)-induced preconditioning. We evaluated here whether Epac could induce PKCepsilon activation and could play a role in ischemic preconditioning through the phosphorylation of connexin43 (Cx43) and changes in gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC). In cultured rat neonatal cardiomyocytes, we showed that in response to Iso and 8-CPT, a specific Epac activator, PKCepsilon content was increased in particulate fractions of cell lysates independently of protein kinase A (PKA). This was associated with an increased Cx43 phosphorylation. Both Iso and 8-CPT induced an increase in GJIC that was blocked by the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide. Interestingly, inhibition of PKA partly suppressed both Iso-induced increases in Cx43 phosphorylation and in GJIC. The same PKCepsilon-dependent Cx43 phosphorylation by beta-adrenergic stimulation via Epac was found in adult rat hearts. However, in contrast with Iso that induced a preconditioning effect, perfusion of isolated hearts with 8-CPT prior to ischemia failed to improve the post-ischemia functional recovery.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 ( TRPV1 ) mediates a novel form of presynaptic long-term depression ( LTD ) in hippocampal interneurons. To date, while TRPV1 is currently being heavily studied in the PNS for its anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory properties, much less is known regarding TRPV1 signaling and function in the CNS, including the mechanism mediating hippocampal interneuron LTD. Here we performed whole-cell voltage clamp electrophysiology experiments on CA1 hippocampal interneurons from Sprague-Dawley male rats to identify this signaling mechanism. Because calcineurin is linked to multiple synaptic plasticity types, we investigated whether TRPV1 activates presynaptic calcineurin, which in turn induces LTD. To do so we employed calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin A or FK-506. To determine the location of the calcineurin involved we either bath applied calcineurin antagonists, blocking calcineurin activity ubiquitously in the slice, presynaptically and postsynaptically, or applied antagonists to the internal solution to block calcineurin postsynaptically. Both calcineurin antagonists applied to the bath blocked TRPV1 -dependent LTD, indicating calcineurin involvement in LTD. Because calcineurin antagonist applied to the internal solution did not block TRPV1 - LTD, it suggests presynaptic calcineurin is required for LTD. Finally, because high frequency stimulus used to induce LTD could potentially activate receptors besides TRPV1, we confirmed that bath, but not intracellularly applied cyclosporin A, also blocked TRPV1 agonist-induced depression of CA1 interneurons.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Developmental epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, have been recognized as potential pathogenic factors in inflammatory bowel diseases, the hallmark of which is an exaggerated immune response against luminal microbes. A methyl-donor ( MD ) diet can modify DNA methylation at select murine genomic loci during early development. The components of the MD s are routinely incorporated into prenatal human supplements. Therefore, we studied the effects of maternal MD supplementation on offspring colitis susceptibility and colonic mucosal DNA methylation and gene expression changes in mice as a model. Additionally, we investigated the offspring mucosal microbiomic response to the maternal dietary supplementation. Colitis was induced by dextran sulfate sodium. Colonic mucosa from offspring of MD -supplemented mothers following reversal to control diet at weaning was interrogated by methylation-specific microarrays and pyrosequencing at postnatal days 30 (P30) and P90. Transcriptomic changes were analyzed by microarray profiling and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The mucosal microbiome was studied by high throughput pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA. Maternal MD supplementation induced a striking susceptibility to colitis in offspring. This phenotype was associated with colonic mucosal DNA methylation and expression changes.

The role of defective glucose transport in the pathogenesis of noninsulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM) was examined in Zucker diabetic fatty rats, a model of NIDDM. As in human NIDDM, insulin secretion was unresponsive to 20 mM glucose. Uptake of 3-O-methylglucose by islet cells was less than 19% of controls. The beta cell glucose transporter (GLUT-2) immunoreactivity and amount of GLUT-2 messenger RNA were profoundly reduced. Whenever fewer than 60% of beta cells were GLUT-2-positive, the response to glucose was absent and hyperglycemia exceeded 11 mM plasma glucose.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

In the current study C57BL/6J mice were injected intraperitoneally with Hg(2+) in the absence and presence of TCDD. After 6 and 24h the liver was harvested and the expression of Cyps was determined. In vitro, isolated hepatocytes were incubated with TCDD in the presence and absence of Hg(2+). At the in vivo level, Hg(2+) significantly decreased the TCDD-mediated induction of Cyps at 6h while potentiating their levels at 24h. In vitro, Hg(2+) significantly inhibited the TCDD-mediated induction of Cyp1a1 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Interestingly, Hg(2+) increased the serum hemoglobin (Hb) levels in mice treated for 24h. Upon treatment of isolated hepatocytes with Hb alone, there was an increase in the AhR-dependent luciferase activity with a subsequent increase in Cyp1a1 protein and catalytic activity levels. Importantly, when hepatocytes were treated for 2h with Hg(2+) in the presence of TCDD, then the medium was replaced with new medium containing Hb, there was potentiation of the TCDD-mediated effect. In addition, Hg(2+) increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA, which coincided with a decrease in the Cyp1a1 activity level. When the competitive HO-1 inhibitor, tin mesoporphyrin was applied to the hepatocytes there was a partial restoration of Hg(2+) -mediated inhibition of Cyp1a1 activity.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Using a clonal strain of cultured Leydig tumor cells (designated MA-10), we have examined the effects of Ca +2 on the activation of cAMP accumulation and steroid biosynthesis by hCG. Our results show that addition of Ca +2 ionophores (A23187 or ionomycin) leads to inhibition of the activation of cAMP accumulation by hCG. The magnitude of this effect is dependent on the concentrations of ionophore and hCG used, becoming more pronounced as the concentration of hCG increases. A detailed examination of the effects of A23187 and removal of extracellular Ca +2 on the rates of cAMP synthesis and degradation in intact cells revealed that A23187 inhibits the rate of cAMP accumulation activated by hCG, but does not affect the rate of degradation of cAMP. On the other hand, removal of extracellular Ca +2 had no effect on the rate of cAMP accumulation activated by hCG or on the rate of degradation of cAMP. Removal of extracellular Ca +2, however, completely prevented the inhibitory effect of A23187 on the rate of cAMP accumulation. Additional experiments show that the effects of A23187 or removal of extracellular Ca +2 on hCG -activated steroidogenesis closely parallel those described for cAMP accumulation.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We investigated the effect of intravenous infusions of aminophylline on plasma glucose, insulin (IRI), glucagon (IRG), growth hormone (HGH), cortisol, and free fatty acid (FFA) levels in healthy young subjects. Six received an intravenous loading dose of aminophylline (6.0 mg/kg over 20 min) followed by a maintenance dose (0.9 mg/kg/hr) for 100 min. Another 7 subjects initially received smaller loading (3.0 mg/kg) and maintenance (0.45 mg/kg/hr) doses, and after 60 min they received a second loading dose (3.0 mg/kg) followed by a larger maintenance dose (0.9 mg/kg/hr) over 120 min. In these fasting volunteers, infusion of aminophylline, which produced theophylline levels in the usual therapeutic range (10 to 20 microgram/ml) caused small increases in plasma glucose levels without changing IRI, IRG, HGH, or cortisol.

During mating, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells must degrade the intervening cell wall to allow fusion of the partners. Because improper timing or location of cell wall degradation would cause lysis, the initiation of cell fusion must be highly regulated. Here, we find that yeast cell fusion is negatively regulated by components of the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway. Loss of the cell wall sensor, MID2, specifically causes "mating-induced death" after pheromone exposure. Mating-induced death is suppressed by mutations in cell fusion genes ( FUS1, FUS2, RVS161, CDC42), implying that mid2 cells die from premature fusion without a partner. Consistent with premature fusion, mid2 shmoos had thinner cell walls and lysed at the shmoo tip. Normally, Cdc42p colocalizes with Fus2p to form a focus only when mating cells are in contact (prezygotes) and colocalization is required for cell fusion. However, Cdc42p was aberrantly colocalized with Fus2p to form a focus in mid2 shmoos. A hyperactive allele of the CWI kinase Pkc1p ( PKC1*) caused decreased cell fusion and Cdc42p localization in prezygotes. In shmoos, PKC1* increased Cdc42p localization; however, it was not colocalized with Fus2p or associated with cell death.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Cat superior cervical ganglia were perfused with a Krebs solution containing 10(-6) M [3H]homocholine (2-hydroxypropyl-trimethylammonium) or 10(-5) M [14C]triethylcholine (2-hydroxyethyl-triethylammonium). Preganglionic nerve stimulation (20 Hz) increased the accumulation of homocholine (3-2-fold) and of triethylcholine (2-1-fold). This increased accumulation during stimulation was not the result of increased metabolism. 2. The increased accumulation of homocholine or triethylcholine induced by pregnaglionic nerve stimulation was not reduced by tubocurarine or by atropine, but it was blocked by choline and by hemicholinium. These results suggested that preganglionic nerve stimulation increased choline analogue accumulation into cholinergic nerve terminals. 3. The increased accumulation of homocholine or of triethylcholine induced by preganglionic nerve stimulation was reduced when the Ca2+ concentration was reduced and was abolished in the absence of Ca2+. However, changes in the Mg2+ concentration which depressed acetylcholine (ACh) release by amounts comparable to those induced by altered Ca2+ concentrations did not alter the uptake of homocholine or triethylcholine. It is concluded that the uptake of choline analogues is not regulated by transmitter release but that stimulation increases the uptake of the choline analogues by a Ca2+-dependent mechanism. 4. The accumulation of ACh by ganglia perfused with a Krebs solution containing choline and high MgSO4 (18 mM) was measured. The ACh content of these ganglia did not increase, although choline transport presumably exceeded that necessary for ACh synthesis to replace released ACh.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Neutrophil granulocytes form the body's first line of antibacterial defense, but they also contribute to tissue injury and noninfectious, chronic inflammation. Proteinase 3 ( PR3 ) and neutrophil elastase (NE) are 2 abundant neutrophil serine proteases implicated in antimicrobial defense with overlapping and potentially redundant substrate specificity. Here, we unraveled a cooperative role for PR3 and NE in neutrophil activation and noninfectious inflammation in vivo, which we believe to be novel. Mice lacking both PR3 and NE demonstrated strongly diminished immune complex-mediated (IC-mediated) neutrophil infiltration in vivo as well as reduced activation of isolated neutrophils by ICs in vitro. In contrast, in mice lacking just NE, neutrophil recruitment to ICs was only marginally impaired. The defects in mice lacking both PR3 and NE were directly linked to the accumulation of antiinflammatory progranulin (PGRN). Both PR3 and NE cleaved PGRN in vitro and during neutrophil activation and inflammation in vivo. Local administration of recombinant PGRN potently inhibited neutrophilic inflammation in vivo, demonstrating that PGRN represents a crucial inflammation -suppressing mediator.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Using the full-length and two engineered soluble forms (C1-C2 and Cla-C2) of type V adenylyl cyclase ( ACV ), we have investigated the role of an intramolecular interaction in ACV that modulates the ability of the alpha subunit of the stimulatory GTP-binding protein of AC ( Gsalpha ) to stimulate enzyme activity. Concentration-response curves with Gsalpha suggested the presence of high and low affinity sites on ACV, which interact with the G protein. Activation of enzyme by Gsalpha interaction at these two sites was most apparent in the C1a-C2 form of ACV, which lacks the C1b region (K572-F683). Yeast two-hybrid data demonstrated that the C1b region interacted with the C2 region and its 64-aa subdomain, C2I. Using peptides corresponding to the C2I region of ACV, we investigated the role of the C1b/C2I interaction on Gsalpha -mediated stimulation of C1-C2 and full-length ACV. Our data demonstrate that a 10-aa peptide corresponding to L1042-T1051 alters the profile of the activation curves of full-length and C1-C2 forms of ACV by different Gsalpha concentrations to mimic the activation profile observed with C1a-C2 ACV. The various peptides used in our studies did not alter forskolin-mediated stimulation of full-length and C1-C2 forms of ACV.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Enteric bacteria and their products play an important role in intestinal inflammation; however, the complete mechanisms are not elucidated yet. Tumor suppressor Foxo3a regulates gene expression in the nucleus, and its translocation to the cytosol leads to inactivation. Proximally, Foxo3a is regulated by different pathways including the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of bacterial infection on Foxo3a in intestinal epithelial cells and to examine the contribution of Foxo3a in intestinal inflammation. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and infection with mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium induce translocation of the nuclear Foxo3a into the cytosol, where it degrades in human HT-29 and mouse CMT-93 cells. In colonic epithelia of healthy mice, Foxo3a is localized in the epithelia at the bottom of the crypts in both the nucleus and the cytosol, while in C. rodentium-infected colon Foxo3a is expressed along the crypts and located mainly in the cytosol, suggesting its inactivation. LPS utilized the PI3K pathway to inhibit Foxo3a. Additionally, inhibition of PI3K attenuated LPS-induced proinflammatory interleukin-8 (IL-8). LPS-induced IL-8 is increased in HT-29 cells with silenced Foxo3a. Moreover, in HT-29 cells with silenced Foxo3a, the amount of IkappaBalpha, an NF-kappaB inhibitor, is decreased.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Impaired wound healing is a common complication of diabetes mellitus. The underlying pathophysiology of diabetes-impaired healing is poorly understood. In the present study we have compared cell proliferation rates, apoptosis (programmed cell death), the myofibroblast marker alpha-smooth muscle actin and procollagen I mRNA expression, between diabetic and control mice. Full-thickness skin wounds were made in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice and C57B6 controls. NOD mice showed a marked retardation of wound healing at both 7 and 14 days after wounding. Comparison of cell proliferation rates 7 days after wounding, using 5-bromo-2'-deoxy-Uridine incorporation, showed higher rates of cell proliferation in controls (88.1 +/- 12.8) than in NOD wounds (52.1 +/- 9.9, p  0.02, n = 4). Immunohistochemical detection of alpha-smooth muscle actin, showed a later onset in diabetic wounds, suggesting that wound contraction may be delayed in the diabetic animals. In situ hybridisation for alpha 1 (I) procollagen mRNA expression, showed reduced procollagen I expression in the diabetic wounds when compared with controls. Lastly, there appeared to be higher levels of apoptosis in diabetic wounds, shown by the terminal transferase mediated UTP nick end-labelling technique. Apoptotic cells were rare in control wounds confirming previous studies, which showed that apoptosis occurs late in normal wound healing as the wound matures into scar tissue.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The effect of meperidine on the spontaneous release of acetylcholine (mepp amplitude and frequency) and on the release evoked by nerve stimulation (epp amplitude and quantal content) was investigated in frog sciatic nerve-sartorius muscle in vitro. Meperidine (8.5 X 10(-5) or 1.6 X 10(-4)M) had no effect on mepp frequency recorded intracellularly in the absence of neuromuscular blockers, but reduced mepp amplitude. This depression was not antagonized by 3 X 10(-8) M naloxone and was explained by a nonspecific depressant action of meperidine on the endplate. When mepps and epps were recorded intracellularly in the presence of high Mg++, the mean amplitudes of both potentials were reduced equally by meperidine (either 1.6 or 4.2 X 10(-4)M) i.e. there was no change in the quantal content, and 3 X 10(-8)M naloxone failed to antagonize these amplitude depressions.

Multiple hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes are down-regulated at the mRNA and protein levels during inflammation and infection. A body of evidence suggests that nitric oxide ( NO ) produced from inducible NO synthase ( NO S2) is responsible for some of these effects. The current study was designed to examine the NO dependencies of the down-regulation of phenobarbital-induced CYP2B mRNAs and proteins by bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) treatment in vivo, using an NO S2-null mouse model. Treatment of C57/BL6 mice with 0.3 mg/kg of LPS maximally suppressed phenobarbital-induced CYP2B9 and 2B10 mRNAs measured 12 hr after injection, whereas 1-10 mg/kg of LPS was required to elevate NO production. Down-regulation of CYP2B mRNAs by 1 mg/kg of LPS was equivalent in wild-type and NO S2-null mice. No effect of LPS in the dose range of 0.3 to 10 mg/kg was observed on microsomal CYP2B protein levels measured 12 hr after treatment, whereas 1 mg/kg of LPS suppressed CYP2B proteins 24 hr after treatment in both wild-type and NO S2-null mice.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The recipients were inoculated intraperitoneally with 10(5) plaque-forming units of RCMV 1 day after transplantation or left noninfected. The grafts were removed on 7 and 14 days, and at 1, 3, and 6 months after transplantation. The presence of viral infection was demonstrated by plaque assays, cell proliferation by [3H]thymidine autoradiography, and vascular wall alterations by quantitative histology and immunohistochemistry. Triple drug immunosuppression reduced the presence of infectious virus in plaque assays and induced early latency of viral infection. It significantly reduced the peak adventitial inflammatory response (P  0.05) and reduced and delayed intimal nuclear intensity and intimal thickening (P  0.05) in RCMV-infected allografts. The proliferative response of smooth muscle cells was reduced by triple drug immunosuppression to 50% of that observed in nonimmunosuppressed RCMV-infected allografts, but still the proliferative peak response was seen at 1 month. Only low level immune activation, ie, the expression of interleukin-2 receptor (P  0.05) and MHC class II, was observed under triple drug immunosuppression in the adventitia of RCMV-infected allografts, whereas there was no substantial change in the phenotypic distribution of inflammatory cells.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

A novel fluorometric proliferation assay, AlamarBlue (AB), was used to study the proliferative capacity of isolated human osteoblasts (hOBs). AB is an oxidation-reduction indicator that yields a fluorescent signal in response to metabolic activity. The assay was performed by replacing the experiment media in a microtiter plate with a 10% AB solution and measuring fluorescence after a 3-8-hour incubation. The assay was optimized with respect to incubation time, cell density, and AB concentration. When the results of the AB assay were compared with cell counting in a Bürker chamber there were consistently good correlations (r > 0.9), regardless of the agonist with which the cells were treated. The mean intraassay coefficient of variance (CV) values were 9.9-11.8% in experiments where osteoblasts were treated for 12 days with insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ; 100 nM), or dexamethasone (1 micro;M). IGF-I dose dependently, at and above 1 nM, stimulated proliferation of hOBs. This effect was detectable after 3 days and reached 130-140% of untreated controls after 12 days in culture.

Asthma exacerbations can be triggered by viral infections or allergens. The Th2 cytokines IL-13 and IL-4 are produced during allergic responses and cause increases in airway epithelial cell mucus and electrolyte and water secretion into the airway surface liquid (ASL). Since ASL dehydration can cause airway inflammation and obstruction, ion transporters could play a role in pathogenesis of asthma exacerbations. We previously reported that expression of the epithelial cell anion transporter pendrin is markedly increased in response to IL-13. Herein we show that pendrin plays a role in allergic airway disease and in regulation of ASL thickness. Pendrin-deficient mice had less allergen-induced airway hyperreactivity and inflammation than did control mice, although other aspects of the Th2 response were preserved. In cultures of IL-13-stimulated mouse tracheal epithelial cells, pendrin deficiency caused an increase in ASL thickness, suggesting that reductions in allergen-induced hyperreactivity and inflammation in pendrin-deficient mice result from improved ASL hydration. To determine whether pendrin might also play a role in virus-induced exacerbations of asthma, we measured pendrin mRNA expression in human subjects with naturally occurring common colds caused by rhinovirus and found a 4.9-fold increase in mean expression during colds. Studies of cultured human bronchial epithelial cells indicated that this increase could be explained by the combined effects of rhinovirus and IFN-gamma, a Th1 cytokine induced during virus infection.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We have previously shown that the nicotine -induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens can be attenuated by local administration into the ventral tegmental area (VTA), of antagonists at nicotinic and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), but not alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptors. In the present study, we investigated the role of nicotinic and NMDA receptors in the VTA for the expression of Fos-like immunoreactivity ( FLI ) in the shell and core of the nucleus accumbens and in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of the rat after acute nicotine administration. Systemically administered nicotine increased FLI in both the mPFC and the nucleus accumbens when compared to saline controls, although this effect was more pronounced, and reached statistical significance in the nucleus accumbens, especially in the core region. When mecamylamine was delivered by reverse dialysis into the VTA, the systemic nicotine -induced FLI was significantly attenuated in the nucleus accumbens. Similarly, the NMDA receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5), infused locally in the VTA, also antagonized the nicotine -induced FLI in the nucleus accumbens. Neither mecamylamine nor AP-5 alone affected basal FLI levels in any of the structures studied. Local administration of nicotine in the VTA increased FLI in the nucleus accumbens but not in the mPFC.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
Since the <el> nicotine <le>-induced <re> FLI <er> is probably due to an increased dopamine release in both the nucleus accumbens and the mPFC, we conclude that <re> FLI <er> in the nucleus accumbens is mediated, to a large extent, through the activation of dopamine neurons via nicotinic and NMDA receptors in the VTA, whereas the <el> nicotine <le>-induced <re> FLI <er> in the mPFC is subjected to a differential control mechanism, tentatively involving nicotinic receptors at the terminal level of the mPFC-projecting dopamine neurons. positive----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), insulin, and TGF-alpha stimulate DNA synthesis in cultured hepatocytes. Each ligand activates a distinct tyrosine kinase receptor, although receptor cross-talk modulates signaling. In rat hepatocytes, HGF can stimulate TGF-alpha production while TGF-alpha antibodies or antisense oligonucleotides suppress HGF-stimulated DNA synthesis. We report that the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGF R) kinase inhibitor PKI166 blocked both basal and ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF R (IC(50) = 60 nM), but not of the insulin receptor or c-met. Pharmacologic inhibition of the EGF R kinase abolished the proliferative actions of HGF and EGF, but not insulin, whereas PI-3 kinase inhibition blocked both EGF and insulin actions.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Although CCN1 (also known as cysteine-rich, angiogenic inducer 61, CYR61) has been reported to promote angiogenesis and neovascularization in endothelial cells (ECs), its effects on endothelial nitric oxide ( NO ) production have never been studied. Using human umbilical vein ECs, we investigated whether and how CCN1 regulates NO production. CCN1 acutely increased NO production in a time- and dose-dependent manner, which was accompanied by increased phosphorylation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) at serine 1177 (eNOS-Ser(1177)), but not that of eNOS-Thr(495) or eNOS-Ser(114). The level of total eNOS expression was unaltered. Treatment with either LY294002, a selective inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase known as an upstream kinase of Akt, or H-89, an inhibitor of protein kinase A, mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1, Rho-associated protein kinase 2, and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K), inhibited CCN1 -stimulated eNOS-Ser(1177) phosphorylation and subsequent NO production. Ectopic expression of small interfering RNA against Akt and S6K significantly inhibited the effects of CCN1. Consistently, CCN1 increased the phosphorylation of Akt-Ser(473) and S6K-Thr(389). However, CCN1 did not alter the expression or secretion of VEGF, a known downstream factor of CCN1 and a potential upstream factor of Akt-mediated eNOS-Ser(1177) phosphorylation. Furthermore, neutralization of integrin v3 with corresponding antibody completely reversed all of the observed effects of CCN1.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Although starvation is known to impair insulin -stimulated glucose disposal, whether it also induces resistance to insulin's antiproteolytic action on muscle is unknown. To assess the effect of fasting on muscle protein turnover in the basal state and in response to insulin, we measured forearm amino acid kinetics, using [3H]phenylalanine (Phe) and [14C]leucine (Leu) infused systemically, in eight healthy subjects after 12 (postabsorptive) and 60 h of fasting. After a 150-min basal period, forearm local insulin concentration was selectively raised by approximately 25 muU/ml for 150 min by intra-arterial insulin infusion (0.02 mU.kg-1. min-1). The 60-h fast increased urine nitrogen loss and whole body Leu flux and oxidation (by 50-75%, all P less than 0.02). Post-absorptively, forearm muscle exhibited a net release of Phe and Leu, which increased two- to threefold after the 60-h fast (P less than 0.05); this effect was mediated exclusively by accelerated local rates of amino acid appearance (Ra), with no reduction in rates of disposal (Rd). Local hyperinsulinemia in the postabsorptive condition caused a twofold increase in forearm glucose uptake (P less than 0.01) and completely suppressed the net forearm output of Phe and Leu (P less than 0.02). After the 60-h fast, forearm glucose disposal was depressed basally and showed no response to insulin ; in contrast, insulin totally abolished the accelerated net forearm release of Phe and Leu. The action of insulin to reverse the augmented net release of Phe and Leu was mediated exclusively by approximately 40% suppression of Ra (P less than 0.02) rather than a stimulation of Rd.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The cytokine TWEAK demonstrates potent kidney proinflammatory and proliferative effects. Recently, we have shown that interactions of TWEAK with its receptor Fn14 are instrumental in the pathogenesis of nephritis in the chronic graft-versus-host (cGVH) induced model of lupus. Fn14 is expressed by macrophages and resident kidney cells; we hypothesized that TWEAK binding to both cell types contributes to the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis. To address this question, we generated bone marrow chimaeras and compared the progression of nephritis during cGVH induced lupus in mice expressing Fn14 only on bone marrow-derived cells, versus mice displaying Fn14 only on non-bone marrow-derived cells. While Fn14 deficiency did not significantly affect autoantibody titers, Fn14 deficiency on bone marrow-derived cells did not inhibit nephritis initiation in mice with Fn14 sufficient non-hematopoeitic cells. Conversely, expression of Fn14 only on bone marrow-derived cells resulted in a delayed, milder disease course. To further explore the role of macrophages, we depleted macrophages during cGVH induction. Surprisingly, we found that macrophage depleted mice displayed significantly increased titers of anti-DNA antibodies and worse kidney disease.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Most mosquito species must feed on the blood of a vertebrate host to produce eggs. In the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, blood feeding triggers medial neurosecretory cells in the brain to release insulin -like peptides (ILPs) and ovary ecdysteroidogenic hormone ( OEH ). Theses hormones thereafter directly induce the ovaries to produce ecdysteroid hormone (ECD), which activates the synthesis of yolk proteins in the fat body for uptake by oocytes. ILP3 stimulates ECD production by binding to the mosquito insulin receptor (MIR). In contrast, little is known about the mode of action of OEH, which is a member of a neuropeptide family called neuroparsin. Here we report that OEH is the only neuroparsin family member present in the Ae. aegypti genome and that other mosquitoes also encode only one neuroparsin gene. Immunoblotting experiments suggested that the full-length form of the peptide, which we call long OEH (lOEH), is processed into short OEH (sOEH). The importance of processing, however, remained unclear because a recombinant form of lOEH (rlOEH) and synthetic sOEH exhibited very similar biological activity. A series of experiments indicated that neither rlOEH nor sOEH bound to ILP3 or the MIR. Signaling studies further showed that ILP3 activated the MIR but rlOEH did not, yet both neuropeptides activated Akt, which is a marker for insulin pathway signaling. Our results also indicated that activation of TOR signaling in the ovaries required co-stimulation by amino acids and either ILP3 or rlOEH.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The objective of this study was to compare effects of RX-871024, a compound with imidazoline structure, and the sulfonylurea glibenclamide, representatives of two groups of ATP-dependent potassium channel (KATP) blockers, on insulin secretion and cytoplasmic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). Furthermore, we studied the interaction of the compounds on these two parameters. The experiments were performed in the perfused rat pancreas, isolated rat pancreatic islets, and dispersed beta-cells. At maximal effective concentrations of the compounds, RX-871024 had a more pronounced insulinotropic effect than glibenclamide, but the increase in [Ca2+]i was similar. Glibenclamide enhanced the insulinotropic effect of suboptimal concentrations of RX-871024 at 3.3 and 16.7 mM glucose. Notably, glibenclamide and RX-871024 also stimulated insulin secretion under Ca(2+)-clamped conditions, i.e., during plasma membrane depolarization with KCl and glucose or in permeabilized islets. The magnitudes of insulin stimulation under the latter types of conditions were similar for both compounds.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The present investigation in experimental animals was designed to obtain further insight into the possible role of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in lipid metabolism. An endogenous hyperparathyroid state was induced in rats by a calcium-poor diet. This type of hyperparathyroidism was associated with a significant increase in serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, a significant decrease in the serum clearance rate of intravenously infused Intralipid and a significant increase in hepatic tissue triglyceride content as compared to the values obtained in control animals. An exogenous type of hyperparathyroidism (parathyroid extract injections) was also accompanied by a slight increase in serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations as well as a decrease in plasma postheparin lipolytic activity (PHLA), but the changes did not reach the level of statistical significance. In the aparathyroid state, a significant decrease in serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations and a significant increase in plasma PHLA were observed as compared to control rats. In additional studies, it could be demonstrated that the endogenous hyperparathyroid state was not associated with increased intestinal absorption of [3H]triolein as compared to control animals. Furthermore, the hepatic triglyceride secretion rate in these hyperparathyroid rats was significantly lower than in normal rats.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Diabetic patients have an elevated risk to develop renal dysfunction and it has been postulated that altered energy metabolism is involved. We have previously shown that diabetic rats have markedly decreased oxygen availability in the kidney, resulting from increased oxygen consumption. A substantial part of the increased oxygen consumption is unrelated to tubular transport, suggesting decreased mitochondrial efficiency. In this study, we investigated the protein expression of mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 in kidney tissue from control and streptozotocin ( STZ )-induced diabetic rats. Protein levels of UCP-2 were measured in adult male control and STZ -diabetic Wistar Furth as well as Sprague Dawley rats in both the kidney cortex and medulla by Western blot technique.

Tobacco plants overproducing alfalfa class 1 hemoglobin (HOT plants) have been shown to have reduced necrotic symptom development. Here, we show that this altered pathogenic response is linked to a significant increase in the nitric oxide ( NO )-affected pathogenesis-related (PR-1a) transcript accumulation in the transgenic plants. Homogenates of HOT transgenic seedlings were also found to have higher NO -scavenging activity than non-transformed ones. The NO -scavenging properties of recombinant alfalfa class1 hemoglobin have been examined. Recombinant Mhb1 (rMhb1) was produced in bacteria and purified using polyethylene glycol (10-25%) fractionation, chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, and Phenyl Superose columns. After the final purification step, the obtained preparations were near homogeneous and had a molecular weight of 44 kDa determined by size-exclusion chromatography and 23 kDa by SDS-PAGE, indicating that rMhb1 is a dimer.

The influence of unlabeled eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) on the release and metabolism of the labeled prostaglandin (PG) precursors was studied with the aid of radio-thin-layer-chromatography (TLC). After incorporation of 14C-AA, the ionophore A 23187 (10 micrograms) stimulated the release of products comigrating on TLC plates with authentic PGI2 (measured as 6-keto-PGF1 alpha), PGE2, PGD2 and AA. In unlabeled ears, A 23187 (10 micrograms) stimulated the release of PGI2 and PGE2 (determined by radioimmunoassay) in similarly relative amounts as found for the labeled products. The release of PGD2 was not measured.

Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is secreted by activated macrophages. In hypertension, Gal-3 is a marker for hypertrophic hearts prone to develop heart failure. Gal-3 infused in pericardial sac leads to cardiac inflammation, remodeling, and dysfunction. N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline ( Ac-SDKP ), a naturally occurring tetrapeptide, prevents and reverses inflammation and collagen deposition in the heart in hypertension and heart failure postmyocardial infarction. In the present study, we hypothesize that Ac-SDKP prevents Gal-3-induced cardiac inflammation, remodeling, and dysfunction, and these effects are mediated by the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta/Smad3 signaling pathway. Adult male rats were divided into four groups and received the following intrapericardial infusion for 4 wk: 1) vehicle (saline, n = 8); 2) Ac-SDKP (800 microg x kg(-1) x day(-1), n = 8); 3) Gal-3 (12 microg/day, n = 7); and 4) Ac-SDKP + Gal-3 (n = 7). Left ventricular ejection fraction, cardiac output, and transmitral velocity were measured by echocardiography; inflammatory cell infiltration, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and collagen deposition in the heart by histological and immunohistochemical staining; and TGF-beta expression and Smad3 phosphorylation by Western blot. We found that, in the left ventricle, Gal-3 1) enhanced macrophage and mast cell infiltration, increased cardiac interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, and causes cardiac hypertrophy; 2) increased TGF-beta expression and Smad3 phosphorylation; and 3) decreased negative change in pressure over time response to isoproterenol challenge, ratio of early left ventricular filling phase to atrial contraction phase, and left ventricular ejection fraction.

The activity of the cold- and menthol-activated transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) channels diminishes over time in the presence of extracellular Ca (2+), a phenomenon referred to as desensitization or adaptation. Here we show that activation of TRPM8 by cold or menthol evokes a decrease in cellular phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P(2)] levels. The decrease in PtdIns(4,5)P(2) levels was accompanied by increased inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (InsP(3)) production, and was inhibited by loading the cells with the Ca (2+) chelator BAPTA-AM, showing that it was the consequence of the activation of phospholipase C ( PLC ) by increased intracellular Ca (2+) concentrations. PtdIns(4,5)P(2) hydrolysis showed excellent temporal correlation with current desensitization in simultaneous patch clamp and fluorescence-based PtdIns(4,5)P(2) level measurements. Intracellular dialysis of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) inhibited desensitization both in native neuronal and recombinant TRPM8 channels. PtdIns(4)P, the precursor of PtdIns(4,5)P(2), did not inhibit desensitization, consistent with its minimal effect in excised patches. Omission of MgATP from the intracellular solution accelerated desensitization, and MgATP reactivated TRPM8 channels in excised patches in a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4K)-dependent manner. PLC -independent depletion of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) using a voltage-sensitive phosphatase (ci-VSP) inhibited TRPM8 currents, and omission of ATP from the intracellular solution inhibited recovery from this inhibition.

The direct effect of growth hormone (GH) on the uterine response to progesterone was tested by using ovariectomized rabbits (at least 12 weeks) treated with GH; GH + progesterone; or progesterone alone. These results were compared with the effect of prolactin or prolactin + progesterone on the uterus. Prolactin treatment produced an increase (P less than 0.01) in the endometrial surface area and restored cytosolic oestrogen and progesterone receptor concentrations to oestrous control values. The sequential treatment of does with prolactin + progesterone stimulated uteroglobin production to a concentration equal to that found in intact rabbits on Day 5 of pregnancy.

Evidence is presented herein that describes the functional implications of the direct association between human Sprouty2 ( hSpry2 ) and c-Cbl, and its impact on the cellular localization and signalling capacity of EGFR. Contrary to the consensus view that Spry2 is a general inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinase signalling, hSpry2 was shown to abrogate EGFR ubiquitylation and endocytosis, and sustain EGF-induced ERK signalling that culminates in differentiation of PC12 cells. Correlative evidence showed the failure of hSpry2 DeltaN11 and mSpry4, both deficient in c-Cbl binding, to instigate these effects. hSpry2 interacts specifically with the c-Cbl RING finger domain and displaces UbcH7 from its binding site on the E3 ligase.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Sprouty-related proteins with EVH1 (enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein homology 1) domain (SPREDs) are inhibitors of MAPK signaling. To elucidate SPRED2 in vivo function, we characterized body homeostasis in SPRED2 (-/-) mice. They showed a doubled daily water uptake, induced by elevated serum osmolality, originating from increased blood salt load. Accordingly, serum aldosterone was doubled, accompanied by augmented adrenal aldosterone synthase (AS) expression. Surprisingly, serum vasopressin (AVP) was unaltered, and, as evidenced by halved angiotensin II (Ang II) levels, the renin angiotensin system (RAS) was down-regulated. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was significantly elevated in SPRED2 (-/-) mice, together with its secretagogue corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and its downstream target corticosterone. ERK phosphorylation in brains was augmented, and hypothalamic CRH mRNA levels were elevated, both contributing to the increased CRH release. Our data were supported by CRH promoter reporter assays in hypothalamic mHypoE-44 cells, revealing a SPRED-dependent inhibition of Ets (ERK/E-twenty-six)-dependent transcription. Furthermore, SPRED suppressed CRH production in these cells.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

1 The chick biventer cervicis muscle immersed in methohexitone (8.8 x 10(-5) M) responded to tetraethylammonium with contractures which were dose-related. The ED50 for tetraethylammonium was 2.1 x 10(-3) M. 2 In the absence of methohexitone, tetraethylammonium produced contractures only at much higher concentrations: these contractures were accompanied by fasciculations and neuromuscular block of the twitch fibres. 3 The contractures produced by tetraethylammonium in the presence of methohexitone were not reduced by exposure to botulinum toxin which eliminated all response of the muscle to indirect stimulation. 4 Tubocurarine (1.2 x 10(-6) M) displaced the dose-response curve for tetraethylammonium -methohexitone-induced contractures to the right. The dose-ratio was 15.63 +/- 1.98. 5 Physostigmine (1.8 x 10(-6) M) potentiated the activity of tetraethylammonium -methohexitone 3.26 or 3.84 fold, depending on the method of calculation used. 6 Physostigmine potentiated contractures elicited by indirect repetitive stimulation 4.8 to 6.0 fold more than it potentiated contractures due to tetraethylammonium -methohexitone.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The p53 gene is a growth control gene, abnormalities of which have been implicated in a variety of cancers. Recently wild-type p53 has been shown to exist in two interchangeable conformational variants, which can be distinguished by specific p53 monoclonal antibodies. One conformation acts as a suppressor (PAb240-/PAb1620+) and one acts as a promoter (PAb240+/PAb1620-) of cell proliferation; the latter conformation is also that of mutant p53. We have previously shown that acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) blasts which proliferate autonomously in vitro express only p53 in the promoter conformation. In contrast, expression of PAb1620 was found only in blasts with non-autocrine growth in vitro and was diminished following stimulation by exogenous growth factors when there was a switch to p53 in the promoter (PAb240+) conformation. As AML blasts with non-autocrine growth undergo apoptosis when deprived of exogenous growth factors, we studied whether this was mediated by wild-type p53. Antisense oligonucleotides to p53 were used to suppress p53 protein expression in blasts with non-autocrine growth and also the factor-dependent human erythroleukaemia cell line TF-1. Following growth factor deprivation for 48 h, 20.6-53.6% of control blasts were apoptotic and demonstrated a typical 'ladder' on DNA electrophoresis characteristic of internucleosomal degradation of DNA. In the presence of p53 antisense, apoptosis was suppressed despite the absence of growth factor, however cell proliferation was not stimulated.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

This paper describes the involvement of sex hormones in the edema togenic response produced by staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) in the mouse hindpaw. Both the paw weight variation and the protein exudate produced by the intraplantar administration of SEB (12.5 micrograms/paw) to intact, randomly cycling female (IRCF) mice were significantly attenuated when the animals were ovariectomized (OVX). The attenuation of SEB-induced paw swelling produced by OVX was not reversed by estradiol (OE2) reposition. Thus, 4 h after the injection of SEB the increase in paw weight in OVX- mice treated with OE2 (10 micrograms/kg in corn oil) was 15.0 +/- 0.9 mg, while the exudation corresponded to 2.1 +/- 0.3 micrograms of Evans blue dye/g of tissue. Neither of these values differed significantly from those obtained 4 h after the intraplantar injection of SEB (12.5 micrograms/paw) in non-treated OVX- mice (paw swelling, 14.0 +/- 0.8 mg; dye exudation, 2.0 +/- 0.3 micrograms/g, N = 6). Pretreating IRCF mice once a day for three days with human chorionic gonadotrophin (40 IU/kg, i.m.) reduced the paw edema produced by the toxin, thus indicating an involvement of gonadotrophins in this event. A pronounced decrease in paw weight variation (about 45%) and dye exudation (61%) was detected when IRCF mice were previously treated every 72 h with three injections of OE2 (10 micrograms/kg in corn oil, i.m.). Similar situations were also seen when the animals were pretreated at 72 h intervals with three injections of testosterone (10 mg/kg in corn oil, i.m. ).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Rapamycin (RAPA) inhibits the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), a crucial immune system regulator. Dendritic cells (DC) generated in RAPA (RAPA-DC) enrich for CD4(+) forkhead box p3 (FoxP3(+)) regulatory T cells and induce T cell apoptosis by an unknown mechanism. RAPA-DC also promote experimental allograft survival, yet paradoxically secrete increased IL-12, crucial for the generation of IFN-(+) CD4(+) T cells. However, IFN- is pro-apoptotic and IL-12 -driven IFN- inhibits experimental graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We hypothesized that IL-12 (hi) RAPA-DC would facilitate IFN--mediated apoptosis of alloreactive T cells and, unlike control (CTR)-DC, would reduce lethal GVHD. Following LPS stimulation, RAPA-DC exhibited decreased MHCII and co-stimulatory molecules and contained a significant population of CD86(lo) IL-12 (hi) cells. Consistent with our hypothesis, both unstimulated and LPS -stimulated RAPA-DC enhanced alloreactive CD4(+) T cell apoptosis in culture. Augmented T cell apoptosis was ablated by IFN- neutralization or using T cells lacking the IFN- receptor, and it was associated with increased expression of Fas and cleaved caspase 8. DC production or responses to IFN- were not important to increased apoptotic functions of RAPA-DC. LPS -stimulated IL-12 p40(-/-) RAPA-DC induced lower levels of T cell apoptosis in culture, which was further decreased with addition of anti-IFN-. Finally, whereas CTR-DC accelerated mortality from GVHD, LPS -treated RAPA-DC significantly prolonged host survival.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We aimed to compare the treatment outcomes and the occurrence rates of adverse events associated with different steroid regimens in geriatric patients (aged 65 years or older) with unilateral idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL). After thorough medical chart reviews of 109 patients with ISSNHL between May 2006 and December 2013, we performed a propensity score-matched analysis using previously known prognostic factors, steroid regimens, and other cointerventions. Patients were divided based on their steroid regimens into group I (which initially received 48 mg of methylprednisolone daily with a subsequently tapered dose) and group II (which initially received 24 mg of methylprednisolone daily with a subsequently tapered dose). We compared final hearing and the occurrence of adverse events between the two groups. As a result, 20 pairs of propensity score-matched patients (n = 40) were enrolled. Group I patients showed better final hearing levels compared with group II patients (42.00  22.35 dB and 57.38  26.40 dB, respectively), although this difference was marginally significant (p = 0.058). Based on the comparative analysis of each of the frequencies in the final audiograms, lower hearing thresholds at 2 KHz were observed in group I (p = 0.049).

Exposure to ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation induces inflammation and photocarcinogenesis in mammalian skin. Docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ), a representative -3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive properties. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of DHA on UVB-induced inflammation in mouse skin. Our study revealed that topical application of DHA prior to UVB irradiation attenuated the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and NAD(P)H:oxidase-4 (NOX-4) in hairless mouse skin. DHA pretreatment also attenuated UVB-induced DNA binding of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-B) through the inhibition of phosphorylation of IB kinase-/, phosphorylation and degradation of IB and nuclear translocation of p50 and p65. In addition, UVB-induced phosphorylation of p65 at the serine 276 residue was significantly inhibited by topical application of DHA. Irradiation with UVB induced phosphorylation of mitogen and stress-activated kinase-1 (MSK1), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and all these events were attenuated by pretreatment with DHA. Blocking ERK and p38 MAP kinase signaling by U0126 and SB203580, respectively, diminished MSK1 phosphorylation in UVB-irradiated mouse skin.

Heme-oxygenase 1 ( HO-1 ) prevents T cell-mediated inflammatory disease by producing carbon monoxide ( CO ) and impairing DC immunogenicity. However, the cellular mechanisms causing this inhibition are unknown. Here, we show that CO impairs mitochondrial function in DCs by reducing both the mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production, and resembling the effect of a nonlethal dose of a classical mitochondria uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP). Moreover, both CO and CCCP reduced cargo transport, endosome-to-lysosome fusion, and antigen processing, dampening the production of peptide-MHC complexes on the surface of DCs. As a result, the inhibition of naive CD4(+) T-cell priming was observed. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction in DCs also significantly reduced CD8(+) T cell-dependent type 1 diabetes onset in vivo. These results showed for the first time that CO interferes with T-cell priming by blocking an unknown mitochondria-dependent antigen-processing pathway in mature DC. Interestingly, other immune functions in DCs such as antigen capture, cytokine secretion, costimulation, and cell survival relied on glycolysis, suggesting that oxidative phosphorylation might only play a key role for the maturation of antigen-containing endosomes.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The goal of the present study was to characterize the Cl- channel responsible for adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate ( cAMP )-stimulated Cl- secretion. To this end, using the patch-clamp technique, we measured Cl- currents. In whole cell patch-clamp experiments, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (CPT- cAMP ) activated Cl- currents that were time and voltage independent, inhibited by diphenylamine 2-carboxylate (DPC), and had a linear current-voltage (I-V) relation. In cell-attached patches of the apical membrane, we identified 7-pS Cl- channels that were stimulated by CPT- cAMP. In inside-out patches with Cl- in the pipette and bath solutions, Cl- currents had a linear I-V relation. The halide permeability sequence was PCl = PBr > PI. The Cl- channel inhibitors DPC, 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoic acid, and glibenclamide blocked the 7-pS Cl- channel, whereas 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid was ineffective.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) is a potent mitogen that is similar structurally to epidermal growth factor (EGF). As EGF is a potent growth stimulator and an inhibitor of iodine metabolism in cultured thyroid cells of several species, we studied whether TGF-alpha has similar effects using porcine thyroid cells in culture. Recombinant human TGF-alpha dose-dependently stimulated DNA synthesis of thyroid cells, with maximal stimulation (eight- to ninefold above basal) occurring at 2 nmol/l. The potency was approximately 50% that of mouse EGF and correlated with the ability to compete with EGF for receptor binding, suggesting that the action of TGF-alpha is mediated by interaction with EGF receptors. When thyroid cells were cultured for 3 days with thyrotropin ( TSH ) in the presence of TGF-alpha, TSH -induced iodide uptake was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. The potency of TGF-alpha again was approximately 50% that of EGF. Transforming growth factor alpha did not inhibit TSH -stimulated cAMP production.

Increasing evidence shows that stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptor (AR) activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), in addition to the classical G(s)- adenylyl cyclase -cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) signaling cascade.

Inhibiting G(i) with pertussis toxin or scavenging Gbetagamma with betaARK-ct overexpression could not prevent beta(2)-AR-induced p38 MAPK activation. In contrast, a specific peptide inhibitor of PKA, PKI (5 microm), completely abolished the stimulatory effect of beta(2)-AR, suggesting that beta(2)-AR-induced p38 MAPK activation is mediated via a PKA-dependent mechanism, rather than by G(i) or Gbetagamma.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Hyperfibrinolysis is a consequence of imbalance between fibrinolytic activators and their inhibitors. Increased levels of circulating plasminogen (Plg) activators such as tissue- or urokinase-type plasminogen activators (tPA or uPA respectively) are the most common causes of hyperfibrinolysis, occasionally causing major hemorrhages. We found that staphylokinase ( SAK ), a well-known Plg activator of bacterial origin, inhibits Plg activation mediated by endogenous tPA and uPA. Furthermore, mixture of SAK with tPA led to a significantly reduced Plg-dependent fibrinolysis. This inhibitory effect was exerted through direct action of SAK on Plg rather than indirectly on tPA or uPA. Inhibition of Plg activation by SAK is readily abrogated by interaction of SAK with human neutrophil peptides (HNPs).

Insulin resistance may result from decreased muscle blood flow, impaired cellular glucose transport, or intracellular deficits of glucose metabolism. The mechanisms responsible for dexamethasone -induced insulin resistance were investigated in healthy human subjects. During a 2-h hyperinsulinemic clamp, dexamethasone decreased glucose uptake, oxidation, and nonoxidative glucose disposal during the first hour. During the second hour, glucose uptake was normalized by means of hyperglycemia; glucose oxidation, however, remained suppressed by dexamethasone. Dexamethasone also abolished the insulin-mediated increase in calf blood flow. When acipimox was administered during the clamps to correct glucocorticoid-induced inhibition of glucose oxidation, dexamethasone decreased whole body glucose uptake and nonoxidative glucose disposal in the same proportion as when no acipimox was administered. However, glucose oxidation and insulin-mediated calf blood flow were normalized after acipimox.

Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene results in highly vascularized tumor s, making the VHL tumor syndrome an ideal system to study the mechanisms of angiogenesis. VHL operates along two pathways with the first involving hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha degradation and down-regulation of its proangiogenic target genes vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor-beta, and the second pathway promoting extracellular matrix ( ECM ) assembly. Secretion of proangiogenic factors was shown to be a primary inducer of angiogenesis. Here, we show that loss of ECM assembly correlates with tumor angiogenesis in VHL disease. Upon inactivation of the VHL- ECM assembly pathway, we observe tumor s that are highly vascularized, have a disrupted ECM, and show increased matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity. Loss of the VHL pathway leading to hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha degradation results in tumor s with increased vascular endothelial growth factor levels but with surprisingly low microvessel density, a tightly assembled ECM and low invasive ability.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The effects of lidocaine (5 or 10 mg/kg bolus + 2.5 mg/kg/h) on arrhythmias and changes in myocardial and plasma catecholamines (CAs) after left coronary artery occlusion were investigated in anesthetized rats. Myocardial intraneuronal CAs were assessed histofluorimetrically and CA concentrations were measured using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Both doses of lidocaine caused reductions in heart rate and blood pressure. The higher dose significantly reduced the number of ischemia-induced ventricular extrasystoles from 425 +/- 123 to 25 +/- 12 in the first 60 min of ischemia and abolished ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. In the myocardium of untreated animals, the area of fluorescing adrenergic neurons (as percentage of total field area) was 0.42 +/- 0.02% after 60 min of ischemia as compared with 1.38 +/- 0.17% in sham-operated animals. Lidocaine pretreatment resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of this ischemia-induced CA release from adrenergic neurons (0.96 +/- 0.06 and 1.30 +/- 0.05% for the lower and higher dose, respectively). Tissue and plasma CA concentrations were not significantly affected by lidocaine pretreatment and by coronary occlusion.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of colorectal cancer generally include oxaliplatin, although inherent and acquired resistance is common. One potential mediator of oxaliplatin sensitivity is the nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase, Src, the activity of which correlates with disease stage and patient survival. Therefore, we investigated the effects of Src inhibition using the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib on oxaliplatin sensitivity. We show that oxaliplatin acutely activates Src and that combination treatment with dasatinib is synergistic in a cell-line dependent manner, with the level of Src activation correlating with extent of synergy in a panel of six cell lines. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated after oxaliplatin treatment, and ROS potently activates Src. Pretreatment with antioxidants inhibits oxaliplatin -induced Src activation. In oxaliplatin -resistant cell lines, Src activity is constitutively increased. In a mouse model of colorectal liver metastases, treatment with oxaliplatin also results in chronic Src activation. The combination of dasatinib and oxaliplatin results in significantly smaller tumors compared with single-agent treatment, corresponding with reduced proliferation and angiogenesis.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Important questions remain concerning how elevated blood glucose levels are coupled to insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells and how this process is impaired in type 2 diabetes. Glucose uptake and metabolism in beta cells cause the intracellular Ca (2+) concentration ([ Ca (2+)](i)) to increase to a degree necessary and sufficient for triggering insulin release. Although both Ca (2+) influx and Ca (2+) release from internal stores are critical, the roles of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) and cyclic adenosine dinucleotide phosphate ribose (cADPR) in regulating the latter have proven equivocal. Here we show that glucose also increases [ Ca (2+)](i) via the novel Ca (2+)-mobilizing agent nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) in the insulin-secreting beta-cell line MIN6. NAADP binds to specific, high-affinity membrane binding sites and at low concentrations elicits robust Ca (2+) responses in intact cells. Higher concentrations of NAADP inactivate NAADP receptors and attenuate the glucose -induced Ca (2+) increases. Importantly, glucose stimulation increases endogenous NAADP levels, providing strong evidence for recruitment of this pathway.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

In the present work the effects of the novel neuropeptide Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase Activating Peptide ( PACAP ) on both AR4-2J cell growth and the modulation of ornithine decarboxylase activity were investigated. Both PACAP 38 and the amidated form PACAP 27 caused a concentration-dependent stimulation of AR4-2J cell growth; the maximal increase was seen at 1 nmol/L (30% above control, P less than 0.01) with a half-maximal effect at 0.01 nmol/L. Ornithine decarboxylase activity was also increased by PACAP in a dose-dependent manner, reaching half-maximal stimulation at 0.5 nmol/L. The addition of 1 nmol/L of somatostatin analog SMS 201-995 totally suppressed PACAP -stimulated AR4-2J cell growth. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (3 mumol/L) and 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (1 mmol/L) had no effect on cell proliferation.

Bradykinin ( BK ) and its analogues induce a typical biphasic response (relaxation followed by contraction) in the isolated rat duodenum. We studied the role of B1 and B2 BK receptors and nitric oxide (NO) in relaxation and contraction of the isolated rat duodenum. Both effects are concentration-dependent: BK has shown an EC50 (contraction) of 3.8 +/- 1.9 x 10(-7) M and an IC50 (relaxation) of 3.0 +/- 0.7 x 10(-9). Similar results were obtained with the selective B2 receptor agonists [Hyp3,Tyr(Me)8]- BK and [Phe8 psi (CH2-NH)Arg9]- BK, showing an EC50 of 9.6 +/- 1.9 x 10(-7) M and 5.6 +/- 2.9 x 10(-7) M and an IC50 of 3.5 +/- 0.6 x 10(-10) M and 6.8 +/- 1.7 x 10(-10) M, respectively. Furthermore, the effects induced by these three agonists were not altered when tissues were treated with 42.1 microM Mergetpa, a carboxypeptidase N inhibitor. While the relaxant and contractile effects elicited by BK were significantly inhibited in the presence of Hoe 140 (0.7 microM), a selective B2 receptor antagonist, those induced by the selective B1 receptor agonist desArg9- BK were not. Furthermore, [Leu8]-desArg9- BK (2.6 microM), which is both a pure and selective B1 receptor antagonist, acted as an agonist on the rat duodenum, inducing a biphasic relaxant and contractile effect.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling controls key aspects of cellular differentiation, proliferation, survival, metabolism, and migration. Deregulated RTK signaling also underlies many cancers. Glycosphingolipids ( GSL ) are essential elements of the plasma membrane. By affecting clustering and activity of membrane receptors, GSL modulate signal transduction, including that mediated by the RTK. GSL are abundant in the nervous system, and glial development in Drosophila is emerging as a useful model for studying how GSL modulate RTK signaling. Drosophila has a simple GSL biosynthetic pathway, in which the mannosyltransferase Egghead controls conversion of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) to mactosylceramide (MacCer). Lack of elongated GSL in egghead (egh) mutants causes overgrowth of subperineurial glia (SPG), largely due to aberrant activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). However, to what extent this effect involves changes in upstream signaling events is unresolved. We show here that glial overgrowth in egh is strongly linked to increased activation of Insulin and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR). Glial hypertrophy is phenocopied when overexpressing gain-of-function mutants of the Drosophila insulin receptor (InR) and the FGFR homolog Heartless (Htl) in wild type SPG, and is suppressed by inhibiting Htl and InR activity in egh. Knockdown of GlcCer synthase in the SPG fails to suppress glial overgrowth in egh nerves, and slightly promotes overgrowth in wild type, suggesting that RTK hyperactivation is caused by absence of MacCer and not by GlcCer accumulation.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

VLDL from either normal or diabetic rats was labelled in vivo in the triglyceride moiety with [3H]palmitate and isolated. Both preparations, if injected intravenously into recipient rats, are removed more slowly from the circulation of diabetic rats as compared to normal rats, resulting in a reduction of the fractional catabolic rate (F.C.R.) by 70%.

After apnea -induced changes in heart rate (HR) were evaluated during dynamic exercise, 23 healthy subjects were selected and divided into a large response group (L group; n = 11) and a small response group (S group; n = 12). While subjects performed a two-legged dynamic knee extension exercise at a work load that increased HR by 30 beats/min, apnea -induced changes in HR, cardiac output (CO), mean arterial pressure (MAP), arterial O(2) saturation (Sa(O(2))), forearm blood flow (FBF), and leg blood flow (LBF) were measured. During apnea, HR in the L group (54  2 beats/min) was lower than in the S group (92  3 beats/min, P  0.05). CO, Sa(O(2)), FBF, LBF, forearm vascular conductance (FVC), leg vascular conductance (LVC), and total vascular conductance (TVC) were all reduced, and MAP was increased in both groups, although the changes in CO, TVC, LBF, LVC, and MAP were larger in the L group than in the S group (P  0.05).

Endocytosis of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor ( LDLR ) in coated pits employs the clathrin adaptor protein ARH. Similarly, agonist-dependent endocytosis of heptahelical receptors in coated pits employs the clathrin adaptor beta-arrestin proteins. In mice fed a high fat diet, we found that homozygous deficiency of beta-arrestin2 increased total and LDL plus intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 23 and 53%, respectively (p  0.05), but had no effect on high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. We therefore tested whether beta-arrestins could affect the constitutive endocytosis of the LDLR. When overexpressed in cells, beta-arrestin1 and beta-arrestin2 each associated with the LDLR, as judged by co-immunoprecipitation, and augmented LDLR endocytosis by approximately 70%, as judged by uptake of fluorescent LDL. However, physiologic expression levels of only beta-arrestin2, and not beta-arrestin1, enhanced endogenous LDLR endocytosis (by 65%) in stably transfected beta-arrestin1/ beta-arrestin2 double-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Concordantly, when RNA interference was used to suppress expression of beta-arrestin2, but not beta-arrestin1, LDLR endocytosis was reduced.

This study was primarily undertaken to determine the effects of AZD7009 on the late sodium current and to examine the impact of late sodium current inhibition on action potential duration in various myocardial cells. AZD7009 inhibited the late sodium current in Chinese Hamster Ovary K1 (CHO K1) cells expressing hNa(v)1.5 with an IC(50) of 11+/-2 microM. The late sodium current in isolated rabbit atrial and ventricular myocytes was also concentration dependently inhibited by AZD7009.

Prolonged stimulation of FRTL-5 thyroid cells with cAMP-generating agents including thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or cAMP analogues potentiates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2 triggered by insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, leading to enhancement of IGF-I-dependent proliferation.

The nature of the signaling pathway (s) which initiate drug-triggered apoptosis remains largely unknown and is of fundamental importance in understanding cell death induced by chemotherapeutic agents.

Mutations in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) genes are associated with congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). As angiotensin (Ang) II, the principal effector peptide growth factor of the RAS, stimulates ureteric bud ( UB ) branching in whole intact embryonic (E) metanephroi, defects in UB morphogenesis may be causally linked to CAKUT observed under conditions of disrupted RAS. In the present study, using the isolated intact UB (iUB) assay, we tested the hypothesis that Ang II stimulates UB morphogenesis by directly acting on the UB, identified Ang II target genes in the iUB by microarray and examined the effect of Ang II on UB cell migration in vitro. We show that isolated E11.5 mouse iUBs express Ang II AT(1) and AT(2) receptor mRNA.

The tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) response is potentiated by thromboxane A2 ( TxA2 ) and/or prostaglandin endoperoxide (PGH2) acting on specific receptors. Infusion of the TxA2 /PGH2 mimetic, U-46,619, into conscious rats leads to hypertension that is potentiated by a high- salt intake. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that a high- salt intake enhances the expression of transcripts for TxA2 /PGH2 receptors in the kidney and glomeruli and enhances the response of TGF to TxA2 /PGH2 receptor stimulation. Groups of rats were accommodated to a low- salt (LS), normal salt (NS), or high- salt (HS) diet for 8-10 days.

Fas (CD95)-induced hepatocyte apoptosis and cytotoxic activity of neutrophils infiltrating the injured liver are two major events leading to hepatitis. Because it has been reported that opioids, via a direct interaction, sensitize splenocytes to Fas -mediated apoptosis by upregulating Fas messenger RNA (mRNA) and modulated neutrophil activity, we assumed that opioids may participate in the pathophysiology of hepatitis. Using the hepatitis model induced by agonistic anti- Fas antibody in mice, we showed that opioid receptor blockade reduced liver damage and consequently increased the survival rate of animals when the antagonist naltrexone was injected simultaneously or prior to antibody administration. Treatment of mice with morphine enhanced mortality. Naloxone methiodide-a selective peripheral opioid antagonist-had a protective effect, but the absence of opioid receptors in the liver, together with lack of morphine effect in Fas -induced apoptosis of primary cultured hepatocytes, ruled out a direct effect of opioids on hepatocytes. In addition, the neutralization of opioid activity by naltrexone did not modify Fas mRNA expression in the liver as assessed with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

Mean baseline free thyroxine (FT4) was 7.55 +/- 0.51 pmol/L (normal, 11.8-24.6) and gradually increased with thyroid hormone to 15.19 +/- 1.0 pmol/L, whereas total thyroxine (TT4) increased from 57.4 +/- 2.6 to 104.4 +/- 5.0 nmol/L (normal, 77-154). Mean pretreatment total triiodothyronine (TT3) was 1.44 +/- 0.09 nmol/L (normal, 1.1-2.7), and was not altered by treatment. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) test was performed in 20 patients before thyroid replacement, and mean baseline and peak TSH levels were 1.33 +/- 0.3 and 7.14 +/- 1.62 mU/L, respectively. In 5 subjects TSH was stimulated to 6 mU/L or more, whereas in 5 others TSH was not affected.

A correlation study of the effects of two agents, 2-methyl-2-[p-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthyl)phenoxy]propionic acid (TPIA) and amiloride, on aldosterone -induced alterations in Na+ transport, lipid synthesis, and phospholipid fatty acid composition has been carried out in the toad urinary bladder. TPIA, an inhibitor of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, inhibits aldosterone -stimulated Na+ transport as well as hormone-induced lipid synthesis and the increase in weight percentage of phospholipid long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.

Experiments were carried out in mutant 129/SvEv mice lacking the endothelin-A (ET(A))-receptor to determine whether endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ), acting as a messenger for oxygen constriction, is responsible for closure of the ductus arteriosus at birth. The isolated ductus from ET(A) -/- fetuses, unlike that from ET(A) +/+ littermates, contracted marginally to oxygen and ET-1 but responded to a thromboxane analog. In vivo, reduction in ductus lumen was equally pronounced in tracheotomized ET(A) -/- and ET(A) +/+ newborns. Conversely, no such vessel narrowing was seen in hyperoxic ET(A), -/- fetuses, although it occurred in ET(A) +/+ littermates. Notwithstanding the uneven behaviour of the ductus in vitro and in vivo, no ET(A) genotype-related difference was noted in the morphology of the vessel on both light and electron microscopy.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

In the present study, we tested our hypothesis that atorvastatin exerts its anti-inflammation effect via suppressing LPS-induced rapid upregulation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mRNA and its downstream p38, ERK, and NF-B signaling pathways in human umbilical-vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). TLR4 mRNA expression and its downstream kinase activities induced by LPS alone or atorvastatin + LPS in endothelial cells were quantified using quantitative real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Preincubation of LPS-stimulated endothelial cells with TLR4 siRNA was conducted to identify the target of the anti-inflammatory effects of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin incubation resulted in the reduction of LPS-induced TLR4 mRNA expression, ERK1/2 and P38 MAPK phosphorylation, and NF-B binding activity. Pretreatment with MEK/ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 attenuated atorvastatin + LPS-induced NF-B activity but had no effect on P38 MAPK phosphorylation. In contrast, pretreatment with P38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 resulted in upregulation of atorvastatin + LPS-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation but had no significant effects on NF-B activity. On the other hand, blocking NF-B with SN50 produced no effects on atorvastatin + LPS-induced ERK1/2 and P38 MAPK phosphorylation. Moreover, TLR4 gene silencing produced the same effects as the atorvastatin treatment.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Muscle development, or myogenesis, is a highly regulated, complex process. A subset of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as critical regulators of myogenesis. Recently, miR-378a was found to be involved in myogenesis, but the mechanism of how miR-378a regulates the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts has not been determined. We found that miR-378a-3p expression in muscle was significantly higher than in other tissues, suggesting an important effect on muscle development. Overexpression of miR-378a-3p increased the expression of MyoD and MHC in C2C12 myoblasts both at the level of mRNA and protein, confirming that miR-378a-3p promoted muscle cell differentiation. The forced expression of miR-378a-3p promoted apoptosis of C2C12 cells as evidenced by CCK-8 assay and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining results. Through TargetScan, histone acetylation enzyme 4 (HDAC4) was identified as a potential target of miR-378a-3p. We confirmed targeting of HDAC4 by miR-378a-3p using a dual luciferase assay and western blotting. Our RNAi analysis results also showed that HDAC4 significantly promoted differentiation of C2C12 cells and inhibited cell survival through Bcl-2.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Alterations of histone methylation dynamically regulated by methyltransferases and demethylases are frequently found in human cancers. Here, we showed that expression of lysine demethylase 2A ( KDM2A ) is markedly increased in human breast cancer and its overexpression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. Knockdown of KDM2A in breast cancer cells reduced proliferation but not viability. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that inhibition of KDM2A down-regulates angiogenic genes with concurrent reduction of Jagged1 (JAG1), NOTCH1 and HEY1 in the NOTCH signaling. Chromatin immunoprecipitation- quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-qPCR) demonstrated the binding of KDM2A to the JAG1 promoter and the increase of methylation of Lys-36 of histone H3 (H3K36) in KDM2A -depleted MDA-MB-231 cells. Tumorsphere formation was significantly reduced in KDM2A -depleted cells which could be reversed by ectopic expression of JAG1. A selective KDM2A inhibitor daminozide also decreased the number of tumorsphere and the number of CD24-/CD44hi cells. In addition, daminozide acted synergistically with cisplatin in cell killing. We identified SOX2 as a direct transcriptional target of KDM2A to promote cancer stemness. Depletion of KDM2A in MDA-MB-231 cells attenuated NOTCH activation and tube formation in co-cultured endothelial cells. Two pro-angiogenic factors JAG1 and PDGFA are key mediators for KDM2A to enhance angiogenesis. Finally, inhibition of KDM2A significantly decreased tumor growth and angiogenesis in orthotopic animal experiments.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

T-bet is a transcription factor that is essential for T helper (Th)1 lineage commitment and optimal IFN-gamma production by CD4(+) T cells. We examined the role of T-bet in the development of experimental crescentic glomerulonephritis, which is induced by Th1 -predominant, delayed-type hypersensitivity-like responses directed against a nephritogenic antigen. Anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) glomerulonephritis was induced in T-bet (-/-) and wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Compared with wild-type controls, renal injury was attenuated in T-bet (-/-) mice with glomerulonephritis, evidenced by less proteinuria, glomerular crescents, and tubulointerstitial inflammation. Accumulation of glomerular CD4(+) T cells and macrophages was decreased, and was associated with reduced intrarenal expression of the potent Th1 chemoattractants CCL5/RANTES and CXCL9/Mig. Supporting the pro-inflammatory nature of T-bet signaling, assessment of systemic immunity confirmed that T-bet (-/-) mice had a reduction in Th1 immunity. The kinetic profile of T-bet mRNA in wild-type mice supported the hypothesis that T-bet deficiency attenuates renal injury in part by shifting the Th1 /Th2 balance away from a Th1 phenotype. Expression of renal and splenic IL-17A, characteristically expressed by the Th1 7 subset of effector T cells, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease, was increased in T-bet (-/-) mice.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The objective of this experiment was to characterize a dose-dependent toxic effect of fumonisin B1 ( FB1 ) and to document initial neurologic signs, clinical progression, and terminal cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) changes in horses administered FB1 IV. Seventeen healthy horses were administered 0.00 (n = 4), 0.01 (n = 3), 0.05 (n = 3), 0.10 (n = 3), or 0.20 mg (n = 4) of purified FB1 IV q24h. When neurologic abnormalities observed by a masked observer became severe, atlanto-occipital CSF taps were performed and CSF pressure, cell count, cytology, protein, albumin and glucose concentrations, and creatine kinase activity were measured. Changes in CSF and number of days to 1st observation of neurologic abnormalities were compared between doses by ANOVA, with the level of significance set at P .05. Control horses and low-dose horses (0.01 mg/kg) remained neurologically normal. In higher dose FB1 -treated horses (n = 10), initial clinical signs (days 4-10) included hindlimb ataxia, delayed forelimb placing, and decreased tongue tone and movement. Hindlimb and trunkal ataxia, depression, hyperesthesia, and intermittent dementia gradually became apparent. When data from all horses with neurologic abnormalities were pooled (0.05-0.20 mg/kg FB1 ), mild clinical signs (mean day 6.3) occurred significantly earlier than did more severe (mean day 8.9) clinical signs (P =.009).

Acute inflammation is characterized by low serum T(3) and T(4) levels accompanied by changes in liver type 1 deiodinase (D1), liver D3, muscle D2, and muscle D3 expression. It is unknown at present whether thyroid hormone receptor alpha (TRalpha) plays a role in altered peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism during acute illness in vivo. We induced acute illness in TRalpha-deficient (TRalpha(0/0)) mice by administration of a sublethal dose of LPS. Compared with wild-type, TRalpha(0/0) mice have lower basal serum T(4) and lower liver D1 activity and muscle D3 mRNA expression, whereas liver D3 activity is higher. These changes are gender specific. The inflammatory response to LPS was similar in WT and TRalpha(0/0) mice. The decrease in serum thyroid hormones and liver D1 was attenuated in TRalpha(0/0) mice, whereas the LPS induced fall in liver D3 mRNA was more pronounced in TRalpha(0/0) mice.

Plasminogen activators are implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases such as inflammatory diseases and cancer. Beside their serine-protease activity, these agents trigger signaling pathways involved in cell migration, adhesion and proliferation. We previously reported a role for the sphingolipid pathway in the mitogenic effect of plasminogen activators, but the signaling mechanisms involved in neutral sphingomyelinase-2 (NSMase-2) activation (the first step of the sphingolipid pathway) are poorly known. This study was carried out to investigate how urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) activates NSMase-2. We report that uPA, as well as its catalytically inactive N-amino fragment ATF, triggers the sequential activation of MMP-2, NSMase-2 and ERK1/2 in ECV304 cells that are required for uPA-induced ECV304 proliferation, as assessed by the inhibitory effect of Marimastat (a MMP inhibitor), MMP-2-specific siRNA, MMP-2 defect, and NSMase-specific siRNA. Moreover, upon uPA stimulation, uPAR, MT1-MMP, MMP-2 and NSMase-2 interacted with integrin alpha(v)beta(3), evidenced by co-immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemistry experiments. Moreover, the alpha(v)beta(3) blocking antibody inhibited the uPA-triggered MMPs /uPAR/integrin alpha(v)beta(3) interaction, NSMase-2 activation, Ki67 expression and DNA synthesis in ECV304.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of osteoclast function widely used to treat excessive bone resorption associated, e.g., with bone metastases. They have also antitumor activity. However, it is unclear whether this reflects an indirect effect via inhibition of bone resorption or a direct antitumor effect. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs), including zoledronic acid ( ZOL ), act by inhibiting farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS). The mevalonate pathway is blocked and the accumulation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) consequently occurs. IPP is conjugated to AMP to form a novel ATP analog (ApppI). The present study was undertaken to clarify whether IPP and/or ApppI has a direct involvement in apoptosis caused by ZOL in different cancer cell lines. There are marked differences in ZOL -induced ApppI formation between different cancer cell lines. On this basis, we selected three cancer cell lines that differ significantly from each other in their ZOL -induced IPP and ApppI accumulation: human estrogen-dependent (MCF7) and estrogen-independent (MDA-MB 436) breast cancer cell lines and a human myeloma cell line (RPMI 8226). The amount of IPP/ApppI correlated with the capacity of cells to undergo apoptosis. Geranylgeraniol (GGOH), an intermediate of mevalonate metabolism, blocks both IPP and ApppI formation and to some degree ZOL -induced apoptosis in a cell line-dependent manner. In addition, lovastatin (LOV), an inhibitor of the enzyme HMGCoA reductase, completely blocks IPP/ApppI formation as determined by mass spectrometry analysis, but enhances apoptosis.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Periodontal disease is associated with chronic oxidative stress and inflammation. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), which is a potent inducer of heme oxygenase 1 ( HO1 ), is a central active component of propolis, and the application of propolis improves periodontal status in diabetic patients. Here, primary murine macrophages were exposed to CAPE. Target gene expression was assessed by whole-genome microarray, RT-PCR and Western blotting. The antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities of CAPE were examined by exposure of the cells to hydrogen peroxide, saliva and periodontal pathogens. The involvement of HO1 was investigated with the HO1 inhibitor tin protoporphyrin (SnPP) and knockout mice for Nrf2, which is a transcription factor for detoxifying enzymes. CAPE increased HO1 and other heat shock proteins in murine macrophages. A p38 MAPK inhibitor and Nrf2 knockout attenuated CAPE-induced HO1 expression in macrophages.

Previous studies suggest that salicylic acid ( SA ) plays an important role in influencing plant resistance to ozone ( O3 ). To further define the role of SA in O3 -induced responses, we compared the responses of two Arabidopsis genotypes that accumulate different amounts of SA in response to O3 and a SA -deficient transgenic Col-0 line expressing salicylate hydroxylase (NahG). The differences observed in O3 -induced changes in SA levels, the accumulation of active oxygen species, defense gene expression, and the kinetics and severity of lesion formation indicate that SA influences O3 tolerance via two distinct mechanisms. Detailed analyses indicated that features associated with a hypersensitive response (HR) were significantly greater in O3 -exposed Cvi-0 than in Col-0, and that NahG plants failed to exhibit these HR-like responses. Furthermore, O3 -induced antioxidant defenses, including the redox state of glutathione, were greatly reduced in NahG plants compared to Col-0 and Cvi-0. This suggests that O3 -induced cell death in NahG plants is due to the loss of SA -mediated potentiation of antioxidant defenses, while O3 -induced cell death in Cvi-0 is due to activation of a HR. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that inhibition of NADPH-oxidases reduced O3 -induced H2O2 levels and the O3 -induced cell death in Cvi-0, while no major changes were observed in NahG plants.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Adult wound healing is characterized by an exuberant inflammatory response and scar formation. In contrast, scarless fetal wound healing has diminished inflammation, a lack of fibroplasia, and restoration of normal architecture. We have previously shown that fetal wounds produce less inflammatory cytokines, and the absence of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, results in fetal scar formation. We hypothesized that increased IL-10 would decrease inflammation and create an environment conducive for regenerative healing in the adult. To test this hypothesis, a lentiviral vector expressing IL-10 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Lenti- IL-10 ) or GFP alone (Lenti-GFP) was injected at the wound site 48 hours before wounding.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of resveratrol, an antioxidant, on the pharmacokinetics of diltiazem and its active metabolite, desacetyldiltiazem, in rats. The pharmacokinetic parameters of diltiazem and desacetyldiltiazem were determined after an oral administration of diltiazem (15 mg/kg) to rats in the presence and absence of resveratrol (0.5, 2.5, and 10 mg/kg). Compared to the control group, the presence of resveratrol significantly (P  0.05) increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of diltiazem, except for resveratrol 0.5 mg/kg. Consequently, the absolute bioavailability (AB) of diltiazem in the presence of resveratrol (2.5 and 10 mg/kg) was significantly (P  0.05) higher (10.2-11.1%) than that of the control (6.9%). The relative bioavailability (RB) of diltiazem in the presence of resveratrol (2.5 and 10 mg/kg) was increased by 1.48- to 1.60-fold.

Treatment with A-769662 resulted in a reduction of NKCC1 (T212/T217) phosphorylation, and this was reversed by treatment with the non-selective AMPK inhibitor Compound C. AMPK dependence was confirmed by treatment of AMPK null mouse embryonic fibroblasts, where A-769662 had no effect on NKCC1 mediated transport. AMPK was found to directly phosphorylate a recombinant human- NKCC1 N-terminal fragment (1-293) with the phosphorylated site identified as S77. Mutation of Serine 77 to Alanine partially prevented the inhibitory effect of A-769662 on NKCC1 activity.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Inflammation and vascular perturbations are increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Prevailing evidence suggests that valproic acid (VPA), an antiepileptic and mood stabilizer, exhibits not only neuro-protective effects, but also anti-inflammatory effects in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the underlying mechanism contributing to VPA's suppression of inflammatory responses remains unclear. In this study, we explored the inhibitory action of VPA on cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression in bEnd.3 mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a pro-inflammatory stimulus. The LPS-induced increases in COX-2 protein level and COX-2 promoter-luciferase activity were significantly suppressed by VPA. VPA inhibited p38MAPK and JNK phosphorylation in LPS-stimulated bEnd.3 cells. Treatment of cells with a p38MAPK inhibitor (p38MAPK inhibitor III) or a JNK signaling inhibitor ( JNK inhibitor II) significantly inhibited LPS-induced COX-2 expression. VPA inhibited LPS-induced NF-B subunit p65 phosphorylation and B-luciferase activity. LPS-increased p65 and C/EBP binding to the COX-2 promoter region was attenuated in the presence of VPA. In addition, VPA suppression of p38MAPK, JNK and p65 phosphorylation, and subsequent COX-2 expression was restored in cells transfected with mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) dominant negative (DN) mutant. VPA also caused increases in MKP-1 acetylation and MKP-1 phosphatase activity in bEnd.3 cells.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Estrogen has been closely associated with breast cancer. Several studies reported that Ca2+ signal and Ca2+ channels act in estrogen-modulated non-genomic pathway of breast cancer, however little was revealed on the function of L-type Ca2+ channels. The L-type Ca2+ channel subunit  1D, named Cav1.3 was found in breast cancer cells. We aimed to investigate the expression and activity of Cav1.3 in human breast cancer, and reveal the effect of estrogen in regulating the expression of Cav1.3. The qRT-PCR and western blotting were employed to show that Cav1.3 was highly expressed in breast cancer tissues. E2 exposure rapidly upregulated the expression of Cav1.3 in dosage- and time-dependent manner, and promoted Ca2+ influx. The silencing of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 30 (GPER1/GPR30) using siRNA transfection inhibited the upregulation of Cav1.3 and Ca2+ influx induced by E2. Moreover, the inhibition of Cav1.3 by siRNA transfection suppressed E2 -induced second peak of Ca2+ signal, the expression of p-ERK1/2, and the cell proliferation. Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) of Cav1.3 siRNA was used in MCF-7 cells in vitro and in the tumor xenografts mice in vivo. The application of UTMD significantly suppressed the tumor growth and promoted the survival rate.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Acute cigarette smoke exposure of the airways (two cigarettes twice daily for three days) induces acute inflammation in mice. In this study, we show that airway inflammation is dependent on Toll-like receptor 4 and IL-1R1 signaling. Cigarette smoke induced a significant recruitment of neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar space and pulmonary parenchyma, which was reduced in TLR4-, MyD88-, and IL-1R1-deficient mice. Diminished neutrophil influx was associated with reduced IL-1, IL-6, and keratinocyte-derived chemokine levels and matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity in the bronchoalveolar space. Further, cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) induced a macrophage proinflammatory response in vitro, which was dependent on MyD88, IL-1R1, and TLR4 signaling, but not attributable to LPS. Heat shock protein 70, a known TLR4 agonist, was induced in the airways upon smoke exposure, which probably activates the innate immune system via TLR4/MyD88, resulting in airway inflammation. CSC-activated macrophages released mature IL-1beta only in presence of ATP, whereas CSC alone promoted the TLR4/MyD88 signaling dependent production of IL-1alpha and pro-IL-1beta implicating cooperation between TLRs and the inflammasome.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The goal was to investigate the effect of micronized fenofibrate, a hypolipidemic drug, on inflammatory markers and proinsulin in patients with type 2 diabetes who had hyperlipidemia. Thirty-nine patients were treated with micronized fenofibrate (200 mg/day for 12 wk). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), fibrinogen, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs CRP), and proinsulin levels were measured at baseline and after 12 wk of therapy. Micronized fenofibrate significantly reduced serum triglyceride, cholesterol, and uric acid levels (all p 0.0001) and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (p 0.001) and creatinine levels (p 0.0001). Micronized fenofibrate also significantly decreased fibrinogen (421 +/- 152 vs 344 +/- 81 mg/dl, p 0.001), hs-CRP (3.3 +/- 3.3 vs 2.1 +/- 1.8 mg/L, p 0.01), and ESR (19.1 +/- 24.8 vs 9.7 +/- 8.7 mm/hr, p 0.01), but did not change proinsulin levels. The correlations among changes of hs-CRP, fibrinogen, and ESR were high.

Relations among cAMP, cGMP, acid production [measured by the intraglandular accumulation of [14C]aminopyrine (AP)], and prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) activity were studied in isolated glands from rabbit fundic mucosa. AP, cAMP, and cGMP responses to histamine, PGE2, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IMX) were compared with controls. Histamine and PGE2 significantly increased glandular cAMP levels twofold, and histamine and IMX stimulated AP uptake two- to fourfold. PGE2 significantly inhibited both histamine - and IMX-stimulated AP accumulation, but it did not alter basal AP uptake. PGE2 also decreased histamine -stimulated cAMP production but only at a low concentration (10(-7) M). This dose of PGE2 was near to the endogenous PGE2 content found in unstimulated glands (10(-8) M). Intraglandular cGMP levels in unstimulated glands (10(-8) M).

The activity state of G proteins is involved in the ligands' maximal responses that can be produced by activating the 5-HT1A receptor (Pauwels et al., 1997). The present study investigated the ligand responses at the recombinant h 5-HT1A receptor (RC: 2.1.5HT.01A) as mediated by the Galpha(o) protein. Therefore, a fusion protein was constructed between the 5-HT1A receptor and a pertussis toxin resistant rat Galpha(o)Cys351Gly mutant protein to define its pharmacological properties at a receptor: Galpha(o) protein density ratio of 1. Pertussis toxin treatment (100 ng/ml) affected neither the expression of the 5-HT1A receptor fusion protein as measured by [3H] MPPF (3.0+/-0.7 pmol/mg protein) nor the 5-HT-mediated [35S]GTPgammaS binding response (146+/-34 fmol/mg protein) in Cos-7 cells. 8-OH-DPAT (Emax: 55+/-7%) and buspirone (Emax: 22+/-4%) yielded partial agonist activity as compared to 5-HT, whereas WAY 100635 acted as a competitive antagonist (pK(B): 9.75+/-0.17). The magnitude of the 8-OH-DPAT response (Emax, %) was highly dependent on the nature of the amino acid 351 in the C-terminus of the Galpha(o) protein: Ile351 (93+/-4) > Cys351 (79+/-3) > Gly351 (55+/-7). The Emax values (%) of buspirone displayed the following gradient: 69+/-5 approximately/= 62+/-8 > 22+/-4. For comparison, maximal responses of 8-OH-DPAT and buspirone were enhanced versus 5-HT upon co-expression of the 5-HT1A receptor with the respective Galpha(o) proteins, probably due to an altered receptor: Galpha(o) protein density ratio.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The radiation-induced "in-pulse" luminescence emission from solid DNA containing either metronidazole or a highly electron-affinic 5-nitrofuran in the range 3-2000 (w:w) base pairs per additive molecule has been investigated in vacuo at 293 K using electron pulses of energy below 260 keV. The luminescence intensity at 450 nm from DNA decreases with increasing content of the additive in the sample and approaches a limiting level at high concentrations of the additives. At these higher concentrations the limiting value represents about 50% of that observed from DNA alone.

However, mice lacking either AC1 or AC8 exhibit normal L-LTP and LTM. Here, we report that mice lacking both enzymes (DKO) do not exhibit L-LTP or LTM.

Apoptosis and autophagy have been shown to be negatively regulated by prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins. We determined whether the anticancer agent celecoxib, alone or combined with a small molecule Bcl-2/Bcl-x(L) antagonist ( ABT-737 ), can induce autophagy in colon cancer cells. Furthermore, we determined whether inhibition of autophagy can drive colon cancer cells into apoptosis. Celecoxib was shown to induce apoptosis that was attenuated by ectopic Bcl-2 or Bax knockout. ABT-737 synergistically enhanced celecoxib-induced cytotoxicity that was primarily due to apoptosis as shown by caspase cleavage and Annexin V labeling that was attenuated by a pan caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk). Celecoxib triggered conversion of the autophagosome-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) from a cytosolic (LC3I) to a membrane-bound (LC3II) form, as shown by immunoblotting and a punctate fluorescence pattern of an ectopic GFP-LC3 protein. Celecoxib-induced conversion of LC3 was due to autophagy induction, as supported using the lysosome inhibitor, bafilomycin A1, which produced an accumulation of LC3II. ABT-737 enhanced celecoxib-induced LC3 conversion and p62/SQSTM1 degradation. Inhibition of autophagy was then studied in an effort to drive cells into apoptosis. 3-methyladenine (3-MA) blocked LC3 conversion, and 3-MA and wortmannin significantly enhanced apoptotic signaling in cells treated with celecoxib plus ABT-737.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Protein C inhibitor (PCI), which was originally identified as an inhibitor of activated protein C, also efficiently inhibits coagulation factors such as factor Xa and thrombin. Recently it was found, using purified proteins, that the anticoagulant thrombin-thrombomodulin complex was also inhibited by PCI. The paradoxical inhibitory effect of PCI on both coagulant and anticoagulant proteases raised questions about the role of PCI in plasma. We studied the role of thrombomodulin (TM)-dependent inhibition of thrombin by PCI in a plasma system. Clotting was induced by addition of tissue factor to recalcified plasma in the absence or presence of TM, and clot formation was monitored using turbidimetry. In the absence of TM, PCI-deficient plasma showed a slightly shorter coagulation time compared with normal plasma. Reconstitution with a physiologic amount of PCI gave normal clotting times. Addition of PCI to normal plasma and protein C-deficient plasma resulted in a minor prolongation of the clotting time. This suggested that PCI can act as a weak coagulation inhibitor in the absence of TM. TM caused a strong anticoagulant effect in normal plasma due to thrombin scavenging and activation of the protein C anticoagulant pathway. This effect was less pronounced when protein C-deficient plasma was used, but could be restored by reconstitution with protein C. When PCI was added to protein C-deficient plasma in the presence of TM, a strong anticoagulant effect of PCI was observed. This anticoagulant effect was most likely caused by the TM-dependent thrombin inhibition by PCI. However, when PCI was added to normal plasma containing TM, a strong procoagulant effect of PCI was observed, due to the inhibition of protein C activation. PCI-deficient plasma was less coagulant in the presence of TM. A concentration-dependent increase in clotting time was observed when PCI-deficient plasma was reconstituted with PCI.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Twelve lean healthy subjects volunteered for the study and were submitted to three euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic glucose clamps to investigate the effect of L-arginine (0.5 g/min in the last 60 minutes of the clamp), D-arginine (0.5 g/min in the last 60 minutes of the clamp), and saline 0.9% NaCl on insulin -mediated glucose uptake. All tests were made in random order. In study 1, L-arginine versus saline infusion was associated with a significant increase in blood flow (131% +/- 7% v 87% +/- 5%, P .001) and whole-body glucose disposal ([WBGD] 61.4 +/- 4.4 v 41.3 +/- 3.5 mumol/kg fat-free mss [FFM].min, P .001). Analysis of substrate oxidation demonstrated that both oxidative and nonoxidative glucose metabolism was improved by L-arginine delivery. After adjustment for the change in blood flow, WBGD was still greater after L-arginine than after saline infusion. Along with L-arginine infusion and independently of the change in blood flow, the percent change in WBGD correlated with the percent change in plasma cGMP (r =.55, P .05).

Lapatinib is active at the ATP-binding site of tyrosine kinases that are associated with the human epidermal growth factor receptor (Her-1 or ErbB1) and Her-2. It is conceivable that lapatinib may inhibit the function of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport ers by binding to their ATP-binding sites. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of lapatinib to reverse tumor multidrug resistance ( MDR ) due to overexpression of ABC subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) and ABC subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) transport ers. Our results showed that lapatinib significantly enhanced the sensitivity to ABCB1 or ABCG2 substrates in cells expressing these transport ers, although a small synergetic effect was observed in combining lapatinib and conventional chemotherapeutic agents in parental sensitive MCF-7 or S1 cells. Lapatinib alone, however, did not significantly alter the sensitivity of non-ABCB1 or non-ABCG2 substrates in sensitive and resistant cells. Additionally, lapatinib significantly increased the accumulation of doxorubicin or mitoxantrone in ABCB1- or ABCG2-overexpressing cells and inhibited the transport of methotrexate and E(2)17betaG by ABCG2. Furthermore, lapatinib stimulated the ATPase activity of both ABCB1 and ABCG2 and inhibited the photolabeling of ABCB1 or ABCG2 with [(125)I]iodoarylazidoprazosin in a concentration-dependent manner. However, lapatinib did not affect the expression of these transport ers at mRNA or protein levels.

To determine whether verapamil prevents depletion of adenine nucleotides during and after severe myocardial ischemia, dogs were subjected to 15 min occlusions of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 240 min of reperfusion. One hour before occlusion, dogs were randomly assigned to a treatment group (n = 10) to which an infusion of intravenous verapamil was given until the onset of reperfusion or to an untreated saline group (n = 9). Verapamil reduced mean aortic pressure and heart rate. After 15 min of ischemia, endocardial adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) level, determined by needle biopsy, decreased in the untreated group from 34.7 +/- 2.0 to 24.4 +/- 2.7 nmol X mg protein-1 (p less than.005 vs preocclusion) and in the verapamil group from 32.8 +/- 1.5 to 30.3 +/- 1.5 nmol X mg protein-1 (NS vs preocclusion).

To investigate the effect of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation on the expression of cell cycle -associated proteins, melanocytic nevi from healthy volunteers were partially covered, irradiated with a defined UV dose, and excised 1 week thereafter. The irradiated and the protected parts were examined separately by conventional microscopy and immunohistochemistry using the antibodies Ki-S11 (Ki-67), Ki-S7 (topoisomerase IIalpha), PC10 (proliferating cell nuclear antigen [PCNA]), DO-7 (p53), 6B6 (p21WAF1/Cip1), and the melanocytic marker HMB-45. DNA nick-end labeling was used as a marker of apoptosis. Irradiation resulted in morphological changes and increased HMB-45 reactivity. Proliferation, as assessed by Ki-67 and topoisomerase IIalpha expression, was also clearly enhanced in the UV-exposed areas. This was confirmed by the appearance of occasional mitotic figures. PCNA expression levels markedly exceeded those of the proliferation markers and did not correlate with the latter in most cases. p21 immunolabeling indices were also consistently augmented after UV exposure; hence it is likely that growth-inhibitory mechanisms partly compensate for the proliferative impulse, and the disproportional rise in PCNA expression probably reflects DNA repair activity. Enhanced p53 immunostaining in four cases suggests that the induction of p21 after irradiation may be p53 mediated, whereas no concomitant apoptotic events were observed.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Salidroside, a bioactive constituent isolated from Rhodiola rosea, has been reported to have anti-inflammatory effects. However, the effects of salidroside on interleukin (IL)-1-stimulated osteoarthritis (OA) chondrocytes remain to be elucidated. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of salidroside on IL-1 -stimulated human OA chondrocytes and explore its underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that salidroside significantly inhibited the production of nitric oxide and prostaglandin E-2, as well as suppressed the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 in IL-1 -stimulated chondrocytes ( P .05). In addition, salidroside also suppressed IL-1 -induced matrix metalloproteinases production in human OA chondrocytes ( P .05).

Chemotherapeutic resistance in breast cancer, whether acquired or intrinsic, remains a major clinical obstacle. Thus, increasing tumor cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents will be helpful in improving the clinical management of breast cancer. In the present study, we found an induction of HO-1 expression in doxorubicin (DOX)-treated MDA-MB-231 human breast adenocarcinoma cells, which showed insensitivity to DOX treatment. Knockdown HO-1 expression dramatically upregulated the incidence of MDA-MB-231 cell death under DOX treatment, indicating that HO-1 functions as a critical contributor to drug resistance in MDA-MB-231 cells. We further observed that DOX exposure induced a cytoprotective autophagic flux in MDA-MB-231 cells, which was dependent on HO-1 induction. Moreover, upregulation of HO-1 expression required the activation of both signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 and its upstream regulator, protein kinase Src. Abrogating Src /STAT3 pathway activation attenuated HO-1 and autophagy induction, thus increasing the chemosensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Cell Tr1, a trigger neuron found in the subesophageal ganglion of the leech, Hirudo medicinalis, is part of a network of subesophageal ganglion neurons which control swimming activity, and makes apparently direct connections to swim-initiating interneurons (SIIs; cells 204 and 205). In this study, we investigated the role of SIIs in swim initiation by cell Tr1. We also examined how brief Tr1 activity controls swim initiation at the levels of the SIIs and of the oscillator neurons. We found: In shortened nerve cord preparations consisting of the head ganglion (supra- and subesophageal ganglia) through segmental ganglia 11 or 12, the effectiveness of swim initiation by Tr1 stimulation was highly correlated with the concurrent injection of depolarizing or hyperpolarizing current into a single cell 204. Tr1 stimulation causes sustained excitation in SIIs, serotonin-containing interneurons and Retzius cells, independent of whether or not swimming is initiated. A short, depolarizing current pulse injected simultaneously into as many as three 204 cells does not replicate the sustained excitation evoked in these cells by Tr1 stimulation. An oscillator neuron, cell 208, is inhibited when Tr1 stimulation fails to elicit swimming, but receives excitatory input from Tr1 otherwise. In another oscillator neuron, cell 115, stimulation of Tr1 suppressed an unidentified source of inhibitory synaptic potentials only on trials which resulted in swim initiation.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

GM-CSF has been showed to be able to induce up-regulated receptor and cytokine expression in mast cells in inflammatory conditions. However, little is known of its effects on protease activated receptor (PAR) expression and Th2 cytokine secretion from mast cells. In the present study, we examined potential influence of GM-CSF on mast cell PAR expression and IL-4 and IL-10 release by using flow cytometry analysis, quantitative real time PCR, ELISA and cellular activation of signaling ELISA (CASE) techniques. The results showed that GM-CSF induced up to 3.0-fold increase in IL-4 release from P815 cells, and FSLLRY-NH(2) and trans-cinnamoyl (tc)-YPGKF-NH(2) did not affect GM-CSF induced IL-4 release. GM-CSF reduced tryptase and trypsin induced IL-4 release by up to approximately 55.8% and 70.3%, respectively. GM-CSF elicited the upregulated expression of PAR-1, PAR-2, PAR-3 and PAR-4 mRNAs, but enhanced only PAR-4 protein expression in P815 cells. U0126, PD98059 and LY204002 almost completely abolished GM-CSF induced IL-4 release when they were preincubated with P815 cells for 30 min, indicating ERK and Akt cell signaling pathways may be involved in the event.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We have previously shown that confluent growth of the human hepatoma cell line Huh7 substantially induces the CYP3A4 mRNA, protein, and activity levels. Here, the mechanisms behind were investigated, and a transcriptome analysis revealed significant up-regulation of liver-specific functions, whereas pathways related to proliferation and cell cycle were down-regulated in the confluent cells. Reporter analysis revealed that the CYP3A4 gene was transcriptionally activated during confluence in a process involving pregnane X receptor (PXR). PXR expression was increased, and PXR protein accumulated in the nuclei during confluent growth. The PXR ligand rifampicin further increased the expression of CYP3A4, and siRNA-mediated knock-down of PXR in confluent cells resulted in decreased CYP3A4 expression. Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), a known modulator of the cell cycle and a negative regulator of PXR, was more highly expressed in proliferating control cells. Trypsinization of the confluent cells and replating them subconfluent resulted in a decrease in CYP3A4 and PXR expression back to levels observed in subconfluent control cells, whereas the CDK2 levels increased. Knock-down of CDK2 in proliferating control cells increased the CYP3A4 and PXR protein levels. Moreover, the CDK inhibitor roscovitine stimulated the expression of CYP3A4. A phosphorylation-deficient mutation (S350A) in the PXR protein significantly induced the CYP3A4 transcription.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

CCN1 /CYR61 is a matricellular protein of the CCN family, comprising six secreted proteins specifically associated with the extracellular matrix (ECM). CCN1 acts as an enhancer of the cutaneous wound healing process by preventing hypertrophic scar formation through induction of myofibroblast senescence. In liver fibrosis, the senescent cells are primarily derived from activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC) that initially proliferate in response to liver damage and are the major source of ECM. We investigate here the possible use of CCN1 as a senescence inducer to attenuate liver fibrogenesis by means of adenoviral gene transfer in primary HSC, myofibroblasts (MFB) and immortalized HSC lines (i.e. LX-2, CFSC-2G). Infection with Ad5-CMV- CCN1 induced large amounts of CCN1 protein in all these cells, resulting in an overload of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and in a compensatory unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR resulted in upregulation of ER chaperones including BIP/Grp78, Grp94 and led to an activation of IRE1 as evidenced by spliced XBP1 mRNA with IRE1-induced JNK phosphorylation. The UPR arm PERK and eIF2a was phosphorylated, combined with significant CHOP upregulation. Ad5-CMV- CCN1 induced HSC apoptosis that was evident by proteolytic cleavage of caspase-12, caspase-9 and the executor caspase-3 and positive TUNEL stain.

The effect of permanent bradycardia on the proarrhythmic action of endothelin-1 ( ET ) was investigated in 24 open-chest anesthetized mongrel dogs. In 12 dogs, permanent bradycardia was induced by radiofrequency ablation of the AV node and the hearts were paced at 70 beats/min. ET (60 pmol/min) was infused into the left anterior descending coronary artery. Blood pressure, coronary blood flow (CBF), and atrial and ventricular epicardial surface ECG were recorded continuously. Polymorphous ventricular tachycardia developed in every dog with permanent bradycardia, and ventricular fibrillation terminated the experiments in 11 cases. Bradycardia prolonged the basal QT but there was no difference in the frequency corrected QTc time between the two groups. ET prolonged the QT time in a similar fashion in both groups. In the control group, six dogs developed sustained ventricular tachycardias and ventricular fibrillation occurred in nine cases. EADP was found in six cases of eight registered.

The minute virus of mice, prototype strain MVMp, productively infects cultured murine fibroblasts but not T cells. The immunosuppressive strain, MVMi, shows the converse tropism. These reciprocal tropisms are mediated by the viral capsids, in which their determinants have been mapped to a few specific amino acids in the primary sequence shared by VP1 and VP2. Which of these proteins is relevant in presenting these determinants during infection is not known. We have approached this question using a recombinant parvovirus system in which a LuIII-derived transducing genome, containing the luciferase reporter in place of viral coding sequences, can be packaged by capsid proteins from separate helper sources. We generated transducing virions by using helper constructs expressing either VP1 or VP2, containing the MVMp or MVMi tropic determinant region, in various combinations. The virions were used to infect human NB324K cells and murine A9 fibroblasts. Transduction of the human cells (permissive for both MVMp and MVMi) required both VP1 and VP2 and was successful with all combinations of these proteins. In contrast, significant transducing activity for A9 cells was detected only with recombinant virions containing VP2 of MVMp, while the use of either source of VP1 had little effect.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Fab fragments of two monoclonal antibodies, AI-3 (residues 140-147) and Al-4.2 (residues 149-150), inhibited the efflux of intracellular cholesterol to serum in a dose-dependent manner. In combination, these antibodies were twice as effective than when used alone. None of the antibodies tested inhibited efflux of the plasma membrane cholesterol. When different types of acceptors were compared for their ability to promote intracellular cholesterol efflux, they were effective in the following order: serum > HDL > apoA-I /PC > pure apoA-I. Antibody AI-3 inhibited efflux of intracellular cholesterol to serum, HDL, and pure apoA-I, but not to apoA-I /PC. Antibody AI-4.2 inhibited efflux to serum, apoA-I /PC, and pure apoA-I, but not to HDL.

GH has antiapoptotic effects in cardiac or noncardiac cell lines; however, increased apoptosis has been found in myocardial samples of patients with acromegaly. The aim of this study was to investigate cardiac apoptosis and underlying molecular mechanisms in transgenic mice overexpressing bovine GH [acromegalic mice (Acro)] aged 3 or 9 months. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase assay and annexin V; expression of pro- or antiapoptotic proteins was assessed by Western blot. Specificity of GH action was confirmed using a selective GH receptor antagonist. Apoptosis was lower in 3-month-old Acro than in controls; reduction was abolished by a GH receptor antagonist. The effects of GH were consistent with an antiapoptotic phenotype (increased Bcl2 and Bcl-XL and reduced Bad and cytochrome c levels, leading to lower activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3). In contrast, apoptosis was higher in 9-month-old Acro than in littermate controls; in addition, a GH receptor antagonist was without effect; the proapoptotic phenotype consisted in increased Bad, cytochrome c, caspase-9, and caspase-3. GH reduced apoptosis through p38 and p44/42 kinase pathways at young ages, whereas phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase was silent; on the contrary, the effects of GH on p38 and p44/42 kinase pathways were overcome by GH -independent stimuli in 9-month-old Acro.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Liver fibrogenesis is sustained by pro-fibrogenic myofibroblast-like cells (MFs), mainly originating from activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC/MFs) or portal (myo)fibroblasts, and is favoured by hypoxia-dependent angiogenesis. Human HSC/MFs were reported to express vascular-endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF-receptor type 2 and to migrate under hypoxic conditions. This study was designed to investigate early and delayed signalling mechanisms involved in hypoxia-induced migration of human HSC/MFs. Signal transduction pathways and intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) were evaluated by integrating morphological, cell, and molecular biology techniques. Non-oriented and oriented migration were evaluated by using wound healing assay and the modified Boyden's chamber assay, respectively. The data indicate that hypoxia-induced migration of HSC/MFs is a biphasic process characterized by the following sequence of events: (a) an early (15 min) and mitochondria-related increased generation of intracellular ROS which (b) was sufficient to switch on activation of ERK 1/2 and JNK1/2 that were responsible for the early phase of oriented migration; (c) a delayed and HIF-1-dependent increase in VEGF expression (facilitated by ROS ) and its progressive, time-dependent release in the extracellular medium that (d) was mainly responsible for sustained migration of HSC/MFs. Finally, immunohistochemistry performed on HCV-related fibrotic/cirrhotic livers revealed HIF-2 and haem-oxygenase-1 positivity in hepatocytes and -SMA-positive MFs, indicating that MFs were likely to be exposed in vivo to both hypoxia and oxidative stress.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Recent data suggest that vanadium (V5+) compounds exert protective effects against chemical-induced carcinogenesis, mainly through modifying various xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes. In fact, we have shown that V5+ down-regulates the expression of Cyp1a1 at the transcriptional level through an ATP -dependent mechanism. However, incongruously, there is increasing evidence that V5+ is found in higher amounts in cancer cells and tissues than in normal cells or tissues. Therefore, the current study aims to address the possible effect of this metal on the regulation of expression of an enzyme that helps maintain endogenous antioxidants used to protect tissues/cells from mutagens, carcinogens, and oxidative stress damage, NAD(P) H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (Nqo1). In an attempt to examine these effects, Hepa 1c1c7 cells and its AhRdeficient version, c12, were treated with increasing concentrations of V5+ in the presence of two distinct Nqo1 inducers, the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and isothiocyanate sulforaphane (SUL). Our results showed that V5+ inhibits the TCDD- and SUL-mediated induction of Nqo1 at mRNA, protein, and catalytic activity levels. At transcriptional level, V5+ was able to decrease the TCDD- and SUL-induced nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 and the subsequent binding to antioxidant responsive element (ARE) without affecting Nrf2 protein levels. Looking at post-transcriptional level; we found that V5+ did not affect Nqo1 mRNA transcripts turn-over rates.

HEF1 is a recently described p130(Cas)-like docking protein that contains one SH3 domain and multiple SH2 binding motifs. In B cells, HEF1 is phosphorylated by a cytoskeleton-dependent mechanism that is triggered by integrin ligation. However, the induction of HEF1 phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptors has not been reported. We found that HEF1, but not p130(Cas), is tyrosine-phosphorylated following stimulation of the rabbit C1a calcitonin receptor stably expressed in HEK-293 cells. The calcitonin -induced tyrosine phosphorylation of HEF1 increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Dibutyryl cAMP and forskolin had little or no effect on HEF1 phosphorylation, and the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 failed to detectably inhibit the response to calcitonin, indicating that the G(s)/cAMP/protein kinase A pathway does not mediate the calcitonin effect. Pertussis toxin, which selectively blocks G(i/o) signaling, also had no effect. Increasing cytosolic Ca(2+) with ionomycin stimulated HEF1 phosphorylation and preventing any calcitonin -induced change in cytosolic calcium by a combination of BAPTA and extracellular EGTA completely blocked the calcitonin -induced tyrosine phosphorylation of HEF1. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also induced HEF1 tyrosine phosphorylation, and the protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C completely inhibited both calcitonin - and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated HEF1 phosphorylation.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Gammaherpesviruses (HV) are implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis in humans and murine models of lung fibrosis, however there is little direct experimental evidence that such viruses induce lung fibrosis in the natural host. The equine HV EHV 5 is associated with equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis (EMPF), a progressive fibrosing lung disease in its natural host, the horse. Experimental reproduction of EMPF has not been attempted to date. We hypothesized that inoculation of EHV 5 isolated from cases of EMPF into the lungs of clinically normal horses would induce lung fibrosis similar to EMPF. Neutralizing antibody titers were measured in the horses before and after inoculation with EHV 5. PCR and virus isolation was used to detect EHV 5 in antemortem blood and BAL samples, and in tissues collected postmortem. Nodular pulmonary fibrosis and induction of myofibroblasts occurred in EHV 5 inoculated horses.

Treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus patients with epratuzumab ( Emab ), a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CD22, leads to moderately reduced B-cell numbers but does not completely deplete B cells. Emab appears to induce immunomodulation of B cells, but the exact mode of action has not been defined. In the present study, we aimed to understand the effects of Emab on B cells using a humanized mouse model (Huki CD22 ), in which the B cells express human instead of murine CD22. Emab administration to Huki CD22 mice results in rapid and long-lasting CD22 internalization. There was no influence on B-cell turnover, but B-cell apoptosis ex vivo was increased. Emab administration to Huki CD22 mice had no effect on B-cell numbers in several lymphatic organs, nor in blood. In vitro exposure of B cells from Huki CD22 mice to Emab resulted in decreased B-cell receptor (BCR) induced Ca(2+) mobilization, whereas B-cell proliferation after Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation was not affected.

The insulin otropic gut hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) has been proposed to have effects on vascular function and glucose disposal. However, whether GLP-1 is able to increase microvascular recruitment (MVR) in humans has not been investigated. GLP-1 was infused in the femoral artery in overnight-fasted, healthy young men. Microvascular recruitment was measured with real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasound and leg glucose uptake by the leg balance technique with and without inhibition of the insulin otropic response of GLP-1 by coinfusion of octreotide. As a positive control, MVR and leg glucose uptake were measured during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Infusion of GLP-1 caused a rapid increase (P  0.05) of 20  12% (mean  SE) in MVR in the vastus lateralis muscle of the infused leg after 5 min, and MVR further increased to 60  8% above preinfusion levels by 60 min infusion. The effect was slightly slower but similar in magnitude in the noninfused contralateral leg, in which GLP-1 concentration was within the physiological range. Octreotide infusion did not prevent the GLP-1 -induced increase in MVR. GLP-1 infusion did not increase leg glucose uptake with or without octreotide coinfusion. GLP-1 infusion in rats increased MVR by 28% (P  0.05) but did not increase muscle glucose uptake. During the hyperinsulinemic clamp, MVR increased 40%, and leg glucose uptake increased 35-fold.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
It is concluded that <el> GLP-1 <le> in physiological concentrations causes a rapid <re> insulin <er>-independent increase in muscle MVR but does not affect muscle glucose uptake. positive----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

Lysophosphatidylcholine ( LPC ) has been shown to induce electrophysiological disturbances to arrhythmogenesis. However, the effects of LPC on the low-voltage-activated T-type Ca(2+) channels in the heart are not understood yet. We found that LPC increases the T-type Ca(2+) channel current (I(Ca.T)) in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. To further investigate the underlying modulatory mechanism of LPC on T-type Ca(2+) channels, we utilized HEK-293 cells stably expressing alpha1G and alpha1H subunits (HEK-293/alpha1G and HEK-293/alpha1H), by use of patch-clamp techniques. A low concentration of LPC (10 micromol/l) significantly increased Ca(v)3.2 I(Ca.T) (alpha1H) that were similar to those observed in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Activation and steady-state inactivation curves were shifted in the hyperpolarized direction by 5.1 +/- 0.2 and 4.6 +/- 0.4 mV, respectively, by application of 10 micromol/l LPC. The pretreatment of cells with a protein kinase C inhibitor (chelerythrine) attenuated the effects of LPC on I(Ca.T) (alpha1H). However, the application of LPC failed to modify Ca(v)3.1 (alpha1G) I(Ca.T) at concentrations of 10-50 micromol/l.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The blockade of exocytosis induced by the putative endogenous ligand for imidazoline receptors, agmatine, was studied by using on-line measurement of catecholamine release in bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells. Agmatine inhibited the acetylcholine-evoked release of catecholamines in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50)=366 microM); the K(+)-evoked release of catecholamines was unaffected. Clonidine (100 microM) and moxonidine (100 microM) also inhibited by 75% and 50%, respectively, the acetylcholine-evoked response. In cells voltage-clamped at -80 mV, the intermittent application of acetylcholine pulses elicited whole-cell inward currents (I(ACh)) that were blocked 63% by 1 mM agmatine. The onset of blockade was very fast (tau(on) = 31 ms); the recovery of the current after washout of agmatine also occurred very rapidly (tau(off = 39 ms). Efaroxan (10 microM) did not affect the inhibition of I(ACh) elicited by 1 mM agmatine. I(ACh) was blocked 90% by 100 microM clonidine and 50% by 100 microM moxonidine. The concentration-response curve for acetylcholine to elicit inward currents was shifted to the right in a non-parallel manner by 300 microM agmatine. The blockade of I(ACh) caused by agmatine (100 microM) was similar at various holding potentials, around 50%. When intracellularly applied, agmatine did not block I(ACh).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

U46619 is a potent platelet agonist, its binding to the thromboxane A2 receptor resulting in Gq-binding protein-mediated responses; nevertheless, it is unable to cause platelet aggregation, unless released ADP is present. In this study we demonstrate that Gi activation is the step U46619 lacks to cause platelet aggregation; in fact, when platelets were treated with an ADP scavenger system, the response to U46619 was restored by the addition of epinephrine, which activates platelets via a Gi protein. The concomitant activation of Gi and Gq proteins does not require increased cytosolic calcium to cause aggregation, as assessed by the fact that platelets treated with the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA were able to respond to U46619 provided ADP or epinephrine was present.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

This study was designed to evaluate the impact of antihypertensive therapy on cardiac dysrhythmias in 13 hypertensive patients who received calcium entry blockers and in 10 hypertensive patients who received hydrochlorothiazide. Mean arterial pressure fell to a similar extent in both treatment groups; however, left ventricular mass index decreased (from 102 +/- 4 to 95 +/- 2 g/m2) only in patients receiving calcium entry blockers, but not in those taking hydrochlorothiazide. The prevalence of premature ventricular contractions decreased 74% from 21 +/- 14/h to 5.7 +/- 6/h in the calcium entry blocker group, but did not change in the hydrochlorothiazide group (15 +/- 17/h to 16 +/- 13/h).

Mouse glucocorticoid receptors ( GR s) are phosphorylated in the N-terminal domain at serine/ threonine residues, most lying in consensus sequences for cell cycle-associated kinases. Glucocorticoid agonists, but not antagonists, induce hyperphosphorylation. Phosphorylation of GR s overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells is cell cycle-dependent: basal phosphorylation in S phase is one third that in G2/M; glucocorticoids induce hyperphosphorylation in S but not G2/M, paralleling the reported sensitivity in S and resistance in G2/M of proliferating cells to transcriptional activation by glucocorticoids. This parallel led us to investigate what controls hyperphosphorylation. We tested three hypotheses: hyperphosphorylation is controlled by 1) negative charge due to basal GR phosphorylation, being permitted in S by low charge and blocked in G2/M by high charge; 2) presence in S and absence in G2/M of required kinases; 3) availability in S and lack in G2/M of unoccupied phosphorylatable sites. Our results are inconsistent with 2) and 3), but strongly support 1). GR mutants with alanines (A7GR) or glutamates (E7GR) replacing all but one phosphorylated site were overexpressed in CHO cells. Serine 122 remained intact to report GR phosphorylation. Consistent with hypothesis 1, with A7GRs hormone-induced hyperphosphorylation occurred in both S and G2/M (thus revealing kinase activity for hyperphosphorylation of at least serine 122 in both phases), whereas with E7GRs it occurred in neither phase.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Certain rat strains acutely increase blood pressure ( BP ) when given diets high in NaCl. Prior results showed that " salt -sensitive" rat strains, at least the ones studied, also increase BP in response to sugar loading. To examine this relationship further and learn more about the pathogenesis of sucrose-induced BP elevations, we examined the effects of unilateral nephrectomy (uninephrectomy) on sucrose-induced BP changes. The rationale is based upon the findings that renal mass removal sensitizes BP response to salt loading. Over 15 weeks, augmented sugar (sucrose) consumption by Long-Evans (LE) rats did not increase BP markedly compared to rats consuming a diet relatively low in sugar unless uninephrectomy was performed. The differences in BP caused by the high sugar diet in a uninephrectomized rat could not be explained adequately by alterations in catecholamine excretion, plasma renin activity, excesses in blood volume, or the other parameters examined. However, salt -induced hypertension has been attributed to the presence of circulating substances affecting ion transport. Among the dietary groups, there was a significant correlation between the ability of plasma to depress PAH and TEA renal slice uptake and the difference in BP. This is consistent with the presence of a circulating factor affecting cell transport that has its greatest activity in the high sugar-uninephrectomy group of LE rats.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Utilizing the rationale that the calcium channel blocker nifedipine decreases lower esophageal sphincter pressure, we performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of sublingual nifedipine in achalasia, a disorder whose treatment depends on reduction in lower esophageal sphincter pressure. Ten patients participated in this trial, completed diaries, underwent manometric determinations of lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and had testing of esophageal emptying rates by a solid-meal radionuclide method. Nifedipine, titrated to a dose of 10-30 mg before meals, was well tolerated. Compared with placebo, nifedipine significantly reduced the frequency of dysphagia, but some symptoms of dysphagia, regurgitation, or nocturnal cough were still present most days. Nifedipine significantly reduced lower esophageal sphincter pressure by 28%, a value approximately one-half that achieved by successful pneumatic dilatation or myotomy.

The effects of 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP) on renal excretion and tubular transport of water and electrolytes were investigated in homozygous DI Brattleboro rats. To ascertain these effects on the loop of Henle, circulating glucagon, parathyroid hormone, and thyrocalcitonin were reduced before the experiments, as these hormones are believed to stimulate the same cells of the thick ascending limb as ADH. dDAVP did not alter either glomerular or proximal tubular functions. In the loop, it consistently raised reabsorption of Mg, Ca, K, and, to a lesser extent, Na and Cl, but phosphate transport was not affected. dDAVP lowered the urinary excretion rates for Mg, Ca, K, Cl, and total solutes. For Mg, this reduction was independent of the drop in the urinary flow rate following dDAVP administration but was significantly correlated to this drop in the case of Ca, K, Cl, and total solutes.

Mutation of the CDC73 gene, which encodes parafibromin, has been linked with parathyroid cancer. However, no correlation between genotypes of germline CDC73 mutations and the risk of parathyroid cancer has been known. In this study, subjects with germline CDC73 mutations were identified from the participants of two clinical protocols at National Institutes of Health (Discovery Cohort) and from the literature (Validation Cohort). The relative risk of developing parathyroid cancer was analyzed as a function of CDC73 genotype, and the impact of representative mutations on structure of parafibromin was compared between genotype groups. A total of 419 subjects, 68 in Discovery Cohort and 351 in Validation Cohort, were included. In both cohorts, percentages of CDC73 germline mutations that predicted significant conformational disruption or loss of expression of parafibromin (referred as 'high-impact mutations') were significantly higher among the subjects with parathyroid cancers compared to all other subjects. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that high-impact mutations were associated with a 6.6-fold higher risk of parathyroid carcinoma compared to low-impact mutations, despite a similar risk of developing primary hyperparathyroidism between two groups. Disruption of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of parafibromin is directly involved in predisposition to parathyroid carcinoma, since only the mutations impacting this domain were associated with an increased risk of parathyroid carcinoma. Structural analysis revealed that a conserved surface structure in the CTD is universally disrupted by the mutations affecting this domain.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Previous studies provided evidence for an interaction between the satiety effects of cholecystokinin ( CCK ), bombesin (BBS), and amylin. Amylin released in response to CCK (or BBS) was supposed to mediate part of CCK's (or BBS's) anorectic effect since the amylin and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist CGRP 8-37 attenuated their anorectic action. Due to the low specificity of CGRP 8-37 for amylin vs. CGRP binding sites, the aim of the present study was to test whether the specific amylin antagonist AC 253 also influenced the anorectic effects of CCK and BBS. Injections took place at dark onset in 24-h food-deprived rats.

As in other salivary glands, the secretory cells of the sheep parotid have a resting K+ conductance that is dominated by BK channels, which are activated by acetylcholine ( ACh ) and are blocked by tetraethylammonium (TEA). Nevertheless, perfusion studies indicate that TEA does not inhibit ACh -evoked fluid secretion or K+ efflux from intact sheep parotid glands. In the present study, we have used whole-cell patch clamp techniques to show that ACh activates K+ and Cl- conductances in sheep parotid secretory cells by increasing intracellular free Ca2+, and we have compared the blocker sensitivity of the ACh -evoked whole-cell K+ current to the previously reported blocker sensitivity of the BK channels seen in these cells. The ACh -induced whole-cell K+ current was not blocked by TEA (10 mmol/l) or verapamil (100 mumol/l), both of which block the resting K+ conductance and inhibit BK channels in these cells. Quinine (1 mmol/l) and quinidine (1 mmol/l), although only weak blockers of the resting K+ conductance, inhibited the ACh -evoked current at 0 mV (K+ current), by 68% and 78%, respectively. 4-Aminopyridine (10 mmol/l) partially inhibited the ACh -induced K+ current and caused it to fluctuate. It also caused the resting membrane currents to fluctuate, possibly by altering cytosolic free Ca2+.

Cats (N = 43) were decerebrated and instrumented to record EMG of the cricopharyngeus, thyrohyoideus, geniohyoideus, and cricothyroideus; esophageal pressure; and motility of LES. Reflexes were activated by stimulation of the esophagus via slow balloon or rapid air distension at 1 to 16 cm distal to the UES. Slow balloon distension consistently activated EUCR and ELIR from all areas of the esophagus, but the distal esophagus was more sensitive than the proximal esophagus. Transection of SLN or proximal recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLN) blocked EUCR and ELIR generated from the cervical esophagus. Distal RLN transection blocked EUCR from the distal cervical esophagus. Slow distension of all areas of the esophagus except the most proximal few centimeters activated secondary peristalsis, and SLN transection had no effect on secondary peristalsis.

We previously demonstrated that angiotensin II ( Ang II ) stimulates an increase in nitric oxide synthase (NOS) mRNA levels, eNOS protein expression and NO production via the type 2 (AT2) receptor, whereas signaling via the type 1 (AT1) receptor negatively regulates NO production in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (BPAECs). In the present study, we investigated the components of the AT1 receptor-linked signaling pathway(s) that are involved in the downregulation of eNOS protein expression in BPAECs. Treatment of BPAECs with either AT1 receptor antagonists or an anti-AT1 receptor antibody induced eNOS protein expression. Furthermore, intracellular delivery of GP-Antagonist-2A, an inhibitor of Galphaq proteins, and treatment of BPAECs with U73122, a phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C (PLC)-specific inhibitor, enhanced eNOS protein expression. Treatment of BPAECs with the cell-permeable calcium chelator, BAPTA/AM, increased eNOS protein expression at 8 h, while increasing intracellular calcium with either thapsigargin or A23187 prevented Ang II -induced eNOS protein expression. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, completely prevented Ang II -stimulated eNOS protein expression at 8 h, whereas depletion of PKC by long-term treatment with PMA, induced eNOS protein expression. Treatment of BPAECs with a PKCalpha-specific inhibitor or transfection of BPAECs with an anti-PKCalpha neutralizing antibody stimulated eNOS protein expression.

LIM kinase 1 ( LIMK1 ) is an important regulator of the cell cytoskeleton. This study aimed to examine the role of LIMK1 in mediating the effects of the Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor fasudil. In vitro cultures of urethral fibroblasts were divided into LIMK1 knockdown ( LIMK1 KD) and LIMK1 control ( LIMK1 NC) experimental groups. Each group was incubated with fasudil (50 mol/L) with or without transforming growth factor 1 (10 ng/mL) for 24 hours. Wound healing and Transwell assays were performed to determine cell migration. Flow cytometry was used to determine apoptosis. LIMK1, collagen I, collagen III, phospho-myosin light chain (p-MLC), alpha smooth muscle actin (-SMA), and phospho-Cofilin (p-Cofilin) expression was examined by Western blot analysis. The expression of LIMK1 was further validated in human urethral scar tissues.

Cardiac sympathetic nerves release neuropeptide Y (NPY)1-36, and peptide YY (PYY)1-36 is a circulating peptide; therefore, these PP-fold peptides could affect cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). We examined the effects of NPY1-36 and PYY1-36 on the proliferation of and collagen production ([(3)H]proline incorporation) by CFs isolated from Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) normotensive rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Experiments were performed with and without sitagliptin, an inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 [ DPP4 ; an ectoenzyme that metabolizes NPY1-36 and PYY1-36 (Y1 receptor agonists) to NPY3-36 and PYY3-36 (inactive at Y1 receptors), respectively]. NPY1-36 and PYY1-36, but not NPY3-36 or PYY3-36, stimulated proliferation of CFs, and these effects were more potent than ANG II, enhanced by sitagliptin, blocked by BIBP3226 (Y1 receptor antagonist), and greater in SHR CFs. SHR CF membranes expressed more receptor for activated C kinase (RACK)1 [which scaffolds the Gi/phospholipase C (PLC)/PKC pathway] compared with WKY CF membranes. RACK1 knockdown (short hairpin RNA) and inhibition of Gi (pertussis toxin), PLC (U73122), and PKC (GF109203X) blocked the proliferative effects of NPY1-36. NPY1-36 and PYY1-36 stimulated collagen production more potently than did ANG II, and this was enhanced by sitagliptin and greater in SHR CFs.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
In conclusion, 1) NPY1-36 and <re> PYY1-36 <er>, via the Y1 receptor/Gi/PLC/PKC pathway, activate CFs, and this pathway is enhanced in SHR CFs due to increased localization of RACK1 in membranes; and 2) <el> DPP4 <le> inhibition enhances the effects of NPY1-36 and <re> PYY1-36 <er> on CFs, likely by inhibiting the metabolism of NPY1-36 and <re> PYY1-36 <er>. negative----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

Xylitol consumption decreases counts of mutans streptococci. However, the mechanism behind this decrease is not well understood. We studied not only type strains and clinical isolates of mutans streptococci, but also other polysaccharide -forming oral streptococci. Growth inhibition and adherence of cells to a smooth glass surface-reflecting synthesis of water-insoluble polysaccharide s were studied in the presence of 2% (0.13 mol/l) and 4% (0.26 mol/l) xylitol. The effect of xylitol was compared to a novel polyol sweetener, erythritol. Except for Streptococcus mutans 10449 and S. sobrinus OMZ 176, the glass surface adhesion of most polysaccharide -forming streptococci was reduced by the presence of both 4% xylitol and erythritol. For the S. mutans and S. sobrinus type strains, the growth inhibition with 4% xylitol and erythritol was 36-77% and for the clinical S. mutans isolates 13-73%. Of the other oral streptococci, only S. sanguinis was inhibited with 4% xylitol (45-55%). For both polyols, the magnitude of the growth inhibition observed was not associated with the magnitude of the decrease in adherence (xylitol: r = -0.18; erythritol : r = 0.49).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

It has been suggested that adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and 12 AMPK-related kinases (ARK), including novel (nua) kinase family 1 ( NUAK1 ), are activated by master kinase LKB1, a major tumor suppressor. Apart from evidence to suggest that NUAK1 participates in induction of tumor survival, invasion and p53-independent cellular senescence, its detailed biological functions remain unclear. Here we showed that in the presence of wild-type LKB1, NUAK1 directly interacts with and phosphorylates p53 in vitro and in vivo.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance have been extensively reported in adult patients with essential hypertension. The aim of this study was to examine serum glucose and insulin levels both in the fasting state and after 0.25 g/kg IV glucose and to relate those findings to the status of intracellular Na+ and red blood cell Na(+)-Li+ countertransport in a population of 21 normolipemic normotensive offspring of hypertensive parents (N-EH) and 13 control children without a history of parental essential hypertension or diabetes mellitus matched for age, body mass index, and pubertal stage. Offspring of hypertensive parents presented significantly higher serum insulin levels both after an overnight fast (17.4 +/- 1.6 versus 11.6 +/- 1.6 microU/mL in control [mean +/- SEM], P .01) and after intravenous glucose than control subjects (insulin area under the curve, 3015 +/- 310 and 2057 +/- 234 microU/mL per hour, respectively, P .01). No relation could be established between the high red blood cell Na(+)-Li+ countertransport (343 +/- 22 versus 215 +/- 15 mumol/L per hour, N-EH versus control; P .002) or high intracellular Na+ (9.8 +/- 0.28 versus 8.7 +/- 0.36 mEq/L, N-EH versus control) and hyperinsulinemia found in children of hypertensive parents.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

To characterize beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor mediated effects in man the influence of the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist bisoprolol and the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 on changes in blood pressure, heart rate and lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density evoked by dynamic exercise or isoprenaline infusion was studied in 12 male normotensive volunteers. Bisoprolol administration (1 X 10 mg/day) did not affect lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density, while ICI 118,551 (3 X 25 mg/day) increased it by about 40%. Exercise as well as isoprenaline infusion caused 100% increases in lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density; these increases were completely abolished by ICI 118,551, but not affected by bisoprolol. ICI 118,551 markedly attenuated isoprenaline-induced decrease in diastolic blood pressure, but did not affect increase in systolic blood pressure; on the contrary, bisoprolol inhibited the isoprenaline-evoked increase in systolic blood pressure, but did not affect the decrease in diastolic blood pressure.

Decreases in blood pH activate NHE3, the proximal tubular apical membrane Na/H antiporter. In cultured renal epithelial cells, activation of the endothelin-B (ET(B)) receptor increases NHE3 activity. To examine the role of the ET(B) receptor in the response to acidosis in vivo, the present studies examined ET(B) receptor-deficient mice, rescued from neonatal lethality by expression of a dopamine beta-hydroxylase promoter/ET(B) receptor transgene (Tg/Tg:ET(B)(-/-) mice). In proximal tubule suspensions from Tg/Tg:ET(B)(+/-) mice, 10(-8) M endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) increased NHE3 activity, but this treatment had no effect on tubules from Tg/Tg:ET(B)(-/-) mice. Acid ingestion for 7 days caused a greater decrease in blood HCO(3)(-) concentration in Tg/Tg:ET(B)(-/-) mice compared with Tg/Tg:ET(B)(+/+) and Tg/Tg:ET(B)(+/-) mice. Whereas acid ingestion increased apical membrane NHE3 by 42-46% in Tg/Tg:ET(B)(+/+) and Tg/Tg:ET(B)(+/-) mice, it had no effect on NHE3 in Tg/Tg:ET(B)(-/-) mice.

Oxandrolone is a synthetic oral non-aromatizable testosterone derivative. This drug has been used successfully for several decades to safely treat growth delays in various diseases including Turner's syndrome. Currently the use of oxandrolone is under clinical testing in children with burn injury; the available data indicate that the anabolic steroid increases net muscle protein balance, maintains lean body mass, and reduces intensive care unit stay. Although oxandrolone is already in clinical trials in burn patients, preclinical burn-related studies with oxandrolone - especially those that go beyond muscle-related parameters and focus on burn-associated organ dysfunction, inflammatory response and wound healing - remain to be conducted. In the current project, using a well-characterized murine model of third-degree burn, we have tested the effect of oxandrolone on indices of organ injury, clinical chemistry parameters and plasma levels of inflammatory mediators. In oxandrolone -treated mice (1mg/kg/day for up to 21 days) there was a significant amelioration of burn-induced accumulation of myeloperoxidase levels in heart and lung (but not the liver and kidney) and significantly lower degree of malon dialdehyde accumulation in the liver (but not the heart, lung and kidney). Oxandrolone-treated mice showed a significant attenuation of the burn-induced elevation in circulating alkaline aminotransferase and amylase levels, while blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels remained unaffected, indicative of protective effects of the anabolic hormone against burn-induced hepatic and pancreatic (but not renal) functional impairment. Multiple burn-induced inflammatory mediators (TNF-, IL-1, IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IP-10, G-CSF, GM-CSF and interferon-) were significantly lower in the plasma of oxandrolone -treated animals after burn injury than in the plasma of controls subjected to burns.

HIV-1 gene regulation is greatly dependent on the presence of the -104/-81 enhancer region which is regulated by both NF-kappaB and NFAT transcription factors. We have found that a greater induction in HIV-1 long terminal repeat-driven gene expression was observed upon PMA/ionomycin (Iono) stimulation of a CD45 -deficient cell line (J45.01) in comparison to the parental Jurkat cells. Unlike NF-kappaB which was not affected by the absence of CD45, NFAT showed a much greater augmentation in nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity in J45.01 cells upon PMA/Iono stimulation. PMA/Iono-induced NFAT activation, NFAT translocation and calcium influx peaked at similar time points for both Jurkat and J45.01 cell lines. The NFAT -dependent promoters from the IL-2 and TNF-alpha genes were also more potently activated by PMA/Iono in J45.01 cells. Interestingly, higher levels of intracellular calcium were consistently demonstrated in PMA/Iono-induced CD45 -deficient cell lines (J45.01 and HPB45.0). Furthermore, PMA/Iono induction of calcium mobilization in both Jurkat and J45.01 cell lines was observed to be EGTA-sensitive. Mechanistic studies revealed that CD3zeta and ZAP-70 were more heavily tyrosine phosphorylated in J45.01 cells than Jurkat cells. Analysis of the HIV-1 enhancer by EMSAs demonstrated that the bound NFAT complex was present at higher levels in J45.01 nuclear extracts and that the NFAT 1 member was predominant.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Hyperlipidemia may contribute to the pathogenesis of glomerular sclerosis. We therefore studied binding and uptake of low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) by cultured rat mesangial cells. In addition effects of LDL on PGE2 synthesis and cell proliferation were determined. At 4 degrees C mesangial cells bound [125I] LDL in a time- and concentration-dependent manner with half-maximal binding observed at 5 micrograms/ml of LDL protein. Binding was blocked by excess unlabeled LDL and by heparin. Uptake (binding plus internalization) of LDL at 37 degrees C markedly exceeded binding at 4 degrees C, continued to increase even with longer periods of incubation, and showed no saturability, consistent with uptake of LDL by mesangial cells. Further evidence for LDL uptake by mesangial cells was obtained by use of the fluorescent probe 1,1'-dioactadecyl-3,3,3', 3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate-labeled LDL (Dil- LDL ). Incubation of mesangial cells with Dil- LDL at 37 degrees C showed positive fluorescence for all mesangial cells, indicating uptake of the Dil- LDL. LDL had a biphasic effect on mesangial cell proliferation as determined by [3H] thymidine incorporation. LDL at 10 micrograms/ml enhanced [3H] thymidine uptake modestly, but significantly, whereas a progressive and marked inhibition occurred at LDL concentration from 100 to 500 micrograms/ml. While LDL at 10 and 100 micrograms/ml significantly stimulated PGE2 production, inhibition of PGE2 by meclofenamate did not influence the effects of LDL on [3H] thymidine incorporation.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The present study identified the proteins involved in the compensatory mechanism activated by FDI6 in HeyA8 ovarian cancer cells using western blot analysis and a reversephase protein array. In addition, a cell viability assay was performed to determine the effects of FDI6 and the compensatory signaling pathway on cancer cell viability. All experiments were performed in threedimensional cell cultures. The present study observed that FDI6 stimulated the upregulation of NRas, phosphoprotein kinase C (pPKC) (S664) and HER3 in HeyA8 cells.

Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins may be responsible for the lipid accumulation in macrophages that can occur in hypertriglyceridemia. Chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins ( VLDL, total and with flotation constant [S(f)] 100-400) from fasting hypertriglyceridemic subjects induced a massive accumulation of oil red O-positive inclusions in unstimulated peritoneal macrophages. Cell viability was not affected. The predominant lipid that accumulated in cells exposed to hypertriglyceridemic VLDL was triglyceride. Hypertriglyceridemic VLDL stimulated the incorporation of [(14)C]oleate into cellular triglyceride up to ninefold in 16 h, but not into cholesteryl esters. Mass increase in cellular triglyceride was 38-fold. The stimulation of cellular triglyceride formation was dependent on time, temperature, and concentration of hypertriglyceridemic VLDL. By contrast, VLDL, low density, and high density lipoproteins from fasting normolipemic subjects had no significant effect on oleate incorporation into neutral lipids or on visible lipid accumulation. (125)I-Hypertriglyceridemic VLDL (S(f) 100-400) were degraded by macrophages in a dose-dependent manner, with 50 and 100% saturation observed at 3 and 24 mug protein/ml (2.5 and 20 nM), respectively. Hypertriglyceridemic VLDL inhibited the internalization and degradation of (125)I-hypertriglyceridemic VLDL (4 nM) by 50% at 3 nM.

The control of prolactin ( PRL ) secretion by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and kainic acid (KA), agonists of NMDA and kainate receptors, and the interactions between NMDA and KA with nitric oxide (NO) were analysed in prepubertal female rats. For this purpose, serum PRL concentrations and hypothalamic and pituitary dopamine ( DA ) and serotonin (5-HT) concentrations were measured in females injected with NMDA, KA or two blockers of NO synthase: Nw-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (NAME) and Nw-nitro-L-arginine (NA). Also, the effects of combined administration of NMDA and KA with the blockers of NO synthase were analyzed. We found that PRL release was inhibited 15 min after NMDA and KA administration, an effect probably mediated through the release of hypothalamic DA, as shown by the higher pituitary DA concentrations after NMDA or KA administration. The inhibitory effect of NMDA was preceded by an increase in serum PRL levels, observed at 5 and 10 min after NMDA administration.

Nephrotoxicity of imipenem was examined after the intravenous administrations of imipenem (200 mg/kg) to rabbits in the presence and the absence of morin (12, 25, 50 mg/kg, p.o.). Cytotoxicity of imipenem was also examined in the presence and the absence of morin (100 microM) by using MDCK cells overexpressing human organic anion transporter 1 and 3 (MDCK/hOAT1 or MDCK/hOAT3). Intravenous dosing of imipenem alone induced severe proximal tubular necrosis in rabbits, however, the concurrent use of morin (25 or 50 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly suppressed the histopathological damage in the kidney induced by imipenem. While imipenem was not cytotoxic in MDCK/hOAT1 cells over the tested concentrations up to 10 mM, it showed significant cellular toxicity with CC(50) of 0.77 mM in MDCK/hOAT3 cells, implying that OAT3 may involve more actively in the imipenem-induced nephrotoxicity.

Transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) can serve as an innate immunity against invading DNA viruses throughout Eukaryotes. Geminivirus code for TrAP protein to suppress the TGS pathway. Here, we identified an Arabidopsis H3K9me2 histone methyltransferase, Su(var)3-9 homolog 4/Kryptonite (SUVH4/ KYP ), as a bona fide cellular target of TrAP. TrAP interacts with the catalytic domain of KYP and inhibits its activity in vitro. TrAP elicits developmental anomalies phenocopying several TGS mutants, reduces the repressive H3K9me2 mark and CHH DNA methylation, and reactivates numerous endogenous KYP -repressed loci in vivo. Moreover, KYP binds to the viral chromatin and controls its methylation to combat virus infection.

Chromatin remodeling has emerged as a hallmark of gastric cancer, but the regulation of chromatin regulators other than genetic change is unknown. Helicobacter pylori causes epigenetic dysregulation to promote gastric carcinogenesis, but the roles and functions of microRNAs (miRNA) in this multistage cascade are not fully explored. In this study, miRNA expression in preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions in murine stomachs induced by H. pylori and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) was profiled by miRNA expression array. miR-490-3p exhibited progressive downregulation in gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and adenocarcinoma during H. pylori and MNU-induced gastric carcinogenesis. Significant downregulation of miR-490-3p was confirmed in human gastric cancer tissues in which its regulatory region was found to be hypermethylated. miR-490-3p exerted growth- and metastasis-suppressive effects on gastric cancer cells through directly targeting SMARCD1, a SWItch/Sucrose NonFermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex subunit. Knockdown of SMARCD1 significantly attenuated the protumorigenic effects of miR-490-3p inhibitor, whereas enforced expression of SMARCD1 promoted in vitro and in vivo oncogenic phenotypes of gastric cancer cells. SMARCD1 was markedly upregulated in gastric cancer in which its high expression was associated with shortened patients' survival independent of TNM staging.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) mediates intestinal absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol. Ezetimibe, by inhibiting NPC1L1 function, is widely used to treat hypercholesterolemia in humans. Interestingly, ezetimibe treatment appears to attenuate hepatic steatosis in rodents and humans without a defined mechanism. Over-consumption of a high-fat diet ( HFD ) represents a major cause of metabolic disorders including fatty liver. To determine whether and how NPC1L1 deficiency prevents HFD -induced hepatic steatosis, in this study, we fed NPC1L1 knockout (L1-KO) mice and their wild-type (WT) controls an HFD, and found that 24 weeks of HFD feeding causes no fatty liver in L1-KO mice. Hepatic fatty acid synthesis and levels of mRNAs for lipogenic genes are substantially reduced but hepatic lipoprotein-triglyceride production, fatty acid oxidation, and triglyceride hydrolysis remain unaltered in L1-KO versus WT mice. Strikingly, L1-KO mice are completely protected against HFD -induced hyperinsulinemia under both fed and fasted states and during glucose challenge. Despite similar glucose tolerance, L1-KO relative WT mice are more insulin sensitive and in the overnight-fasted state display significantly lower plasma glucose concentrations.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Obesity increases severity of acute pancreatitis ( AP ) by unclear mechanisms. We investigated the effect of the PPAR-gamma agonist rosiglitazone ( RGZ, 0.01% in the diet) on severity of AP induced by administration of IL-12+ IL-18 in male C57BL6 mice fed a low fat (LFD) or high fat diet (HFD), under the hypothesis that RGZ would reduce disease severity in HFD-fed obese animals. In both LFD and HFD mice without AP, RGZ significantly increased body weight and % fat mass, with significant upregulation of adiponectin and suppression of erythropoiesis. In HFD mice with AP, RGZ significantly increased survival and hastened recovery from pancreatic inflammation, as evaluated by significantly improved pancreatic histology, reduced saponification of visceral adipose tissue and less severe suppression of erythropoiesis at Day 7 post- AP. This was associated with significantly lower circulating and pancreas-associated levels of IL-6, Galectin-3, osteopontin and TIMP-1 in HFD + RGZ mice, particularly at Day 7 post- AP. In LFD mice with AP, RGZ significantly worsened the degree of intrapancreatic acinar and fat necrosis as well as visceral fat saponification, without affecting other parameters of disease severity or inflammation. Induction of AP lead to major suppression of adiponectin levels at Day 7 in both HFD and HFD + RGZ mice.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Previous studies have suggested anti-tumor effects of asiatic acid in some human cancer cell lines. This agent is reported to increase the levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 in human breast cancer cell lines. However, the molecular mechanisms have not been established. Here we report that asiatic acid up-regulates p21WAF1/CIP1 protein expression but not the level of p21WAF1/CIP1 mRNA in HepG2 human hepatoma cells. Furthermore, we found that the asiatic acid induced increase of p21WAF1/CIP1 protein was associated with decreased phosphorylation (ser-146) of p21WAF1/CIP1. Knockdown of NDR1/2 kinase, which directly phosphorylates p21WAF1/CIP1 protein at ser-146 and enhances its proteasomal degradation, increased the levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 protein and eliminated the regulation of p21WAF1/ CIP1 stability by asiatic acid. At the same time, the expression of NDR1/2 kinase decreased during treatment with asiatic acid in HepG2 cells. Moreover, asiatic acid inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells, this being attenuated by knockdown of p21WAF1/CIP1.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
In conclusion, we propose that <el> asiatic acid <le> inhibits the expression <re> NDR1/2 kinase <er> and promotes the stability of p21WAF1/CIP1 protein through attenuating NDR1/2 dependent phosphorylation of p21WAF1/CIP1 in HepG2 cells. negative----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

We have shown that mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ), a model of multiple sclerosis, have upregulated leptin receptor expression in reactive astrocytes of the hippocampus, a region involved in sickness behavior. Leptin can exacerbate EAE when its serum concentration is high. Although leptin receptors in astrocytes modulate leptin transport across cultured endothelial cell monolayers, it is not known how leptin transport in EAE mice is regulated. Here, we determined brain and cervical spinal cord uptake of leptin in early and recovery stages of EAE, after either intravenous delivery or in situ brain perfusion of (125)I- leptin and the vascular marker (131)I-albumin. While increased vascular space and general blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability after EAE were expected, the specific saturable transport system for leptin crossing the BBB also persisted. Moreover, there was upregulation of leptin transport in hippocampus and cervical spinal cord in the early stage of EAE, shown by higher leptin uptake in these regions and by competitive inhibition with coadministered excess unlabeled leptin.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Continuous administration of LHRH agonists in high doses disrupts pituitary and testicular function, thus providing an approach to male fertility control. However, testosterone supplementation is required to prevent the side effects associated with low androgen concentrations resulting from chronic LHRH agonist treatment. Three adult male rhesus monkeys were treated with the LHRH agonist, Buserelin, using osmotic minipumps implanted subcutaneously. Testosterone was administered simultaneously via Silastic capsules. This combined treatment led to a marked decrease in testicular volume, and all animals were oligospermic within 8-15 weeks of treatment. Azoospermia was, however, not achieved even after 22 weeks of treatment although in a previous study in which the LHRH agonist had been administered alone, azoospermia had been achieved after 8-10 weeks.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We now investigate its potential effects on the brain versus the semirecumbent position. We studied seventeen anesthetized pigs and randomized to be ventilated and positioned as follows: duty cycle (TI/TTOT) of 0.33, without positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), placed with the bed oriented 30° in anti-Trendelenburg (control group); positioned as in the control group, with TI/TTOT adjusted to achieve an expiratory flow bias, PEEP of 5 cm H2O (IRV-PEEP); positioned in 5° TP and ventilated as in the control group ( TP ). Animals were challenged into the oropharynx with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We assessed hemodynamic parameters and systemic inflammation throughout the study. After 72 hours, we evaluated incidence of microbiological/histological VAP and brain injury. Petechial haemorrhages score was greater in the TP group (p = 0.013). Analysis of the dentate gyrus showed higher cell apoptosis and deteriorating neurons in TP animals (p  0.05 vs. the other groups). No differences in systemic inflammation were found among groups. Cerebral perfusion pressure was higher in TP animals (p  0.001), mainly driven by higher mean arterial pressure.

Degradation of surface-bound fibronectin of the upper respiratory tract by human leucocyte elastase (HLE) was shown to favour colonization of these mucosal surfaces by Gram-negative bacteria. We investigated the degradation of fibronectin by purified HLE and by enzymes released from stimulated human polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs), in the presence of recombinant secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor ( rSLPI ) and alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1-PI), the two main inhibitors of HLE within the airways. Our results show that HLE degraded fibronectin at concentrations as low as 0.2 nM. To inhibit the degradation of fibronectin by pure HLE in an experimental system in which the enzyme was premixed with inhibitor, a twofold molar excess of rSLPI and an equimolar concentration of alpha 1-PI were required. On the other hand, a fivefold molar excess of rSLPI was necessary to inhibit degradation of fibronectin by enzymes released from stimulated neutrophils. In order to estimate the role of oxidants generated by stimulated PMNs in the activation of the inhibitory capacity of rSLPI by stimulated PMNs, we preincubated PMNs with antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase, methionine, catalase or Na-azide prior to stimulation of the cells. Under these conditions, a threefold molar excess of rSLPI over released HLE was required to inhibit the degradation of fibronectin, raising the possibility that either exogenous or endogenous antioxidants in the lung could be important in improving the efficacy of this therapeutic antiprotease.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We found when L-type calcium current ( ICa-L ) was recorded with the perforated patch-clamp method in rat ventricular myocytes that bath application of phenylephrine (with propranolol) evoked a biphasic response characterized by an initial transient suppression followed by a sustained potentiation. The transient suppression occurred 30-60 s after phenylephrine perfusion and reached peak inhibition at approximately 2 min. The biphasic modulation of ICa-L was also elicited by methoxamine, and the effects of phenylephrine were blocked by prazosin, indicating that the responses were mediated through alpha1-adrenoceptors. Pretreatment of cells with H7 (100 micromol/L), a broad-spectrum protein kinase inhibitor that inhibits both protein kinase C and A, eliminated potentiation but did not affect transient suppression. The transient suppression occurred concurrently with the acceleration of the fast component of ICa-L inactivation. Depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by ryanodine plus caffeine or thapsigargin eliminated the transient suppression. When ICa-L was recorded with whole-cell patch-clamp and with 0.05 mmol/L EGTA in the pipette solution to allow intracellular Ca2+ to fluctuate, phenylephrine evoked a transient suppression as in the perforated patch recordings. Heparin, a specific blocker of IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) receptors, eliminated the phenylephrine -induced transient suppression of ICa-L when added to the pipette solution.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

In the present study, we investigated the effect of AKAP2 in vitro. We successfully isolated human growth plate chondrocytes ( GPC s) from growth plate cartilage tissues and identified GPC s by aggrecan expression and flow cytometric analysis. AKAP2 overexpression significantly promoted GPC proliferation, enhanced GPC differentiation, and promoted extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis, whereas AKAP2 silencing exerted the opposite effects on GPC s. AKAP2 overexpression increased, while AKAP2 silencing decreased, the protein levels of p-extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK)1/2.

1. Hippocampal neurones respond to acute oxygen deprivation ( hypoxia ) with an inhibition of whole-cell Na+ current (INa), although the mechanism of the inhibition is unknown. Kinases can modulate INa and kinases are activated during hypoxia. We hypothesized that kinase activation may play a role in the hypoxia -induced inhibition of INa. 2. Single electrode patch clamp techniques were used in dissociated hippocampal CA1 neurones from the rat. INa was recorded at baseline, during exposure to kinase activators (with and without kinase inhibitors), and during acute hypoxia (with and without kinase inhibitors). 3. Hypoxia (3 min) reduced INa to 38.1 +/- 4.5% of initial values, and shifted steady-state inactivation in the negative direction. Hypoxia produced no effect on activation or fast inactivation. 4. Protein kinase A (PKA) activation with 2.5 mM adenosine 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate, N6,O2-dibutyryl, sodium salt (db-cAMP) resulted in reduction of INa to 62.8 +/- 5.5% without an effect on activation or steady-state inactivation.

(-)-N-(trans-4-Isopropylcyclohexanecarbonyl)-D-phenylalanine ( A-4166 ) is a new nonsulfonylurea hypoglycemic agent that lowers blood glucose by stimulating insulin release. In the present study, we examined the effects of A-4166, voglibose (an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor), and glibenclamide (a sulfonylurea) on the postprandial glycemic increase in rats with or without diabetes mellitus. Oral administration of A-4166 (25-100 mg/kg) dose-dependently decreased blood glucose with a rapid onset and short duration in normal rats. On the other hand, glibenclamide (1-4 mg/kg) showed a slower onset of its hypoglycemic action, and voglibose (0.2 mg/kg) had no effect. In the case of postprandial glucose excursion, the carbohydrate-induced increase in blood glucose was reduced by oral administration of either A-4166 or voglibose without causing sustained hypoglycemia in both normal and neonatal streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. However, the efficacy of voglibose varied with the type of carbohydrate load. Glibenclamide produced a prolonged decrease in blood glucose without any appreciable effect on the initial glucose excursion.

Tissue factor (TF), apart from activating the extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation, is a principal regulator of embryonic and oncogenic angiogenesis, inflammation, leukocyte reverse transmigration, and tumor progression. It has become clear that these events are mediated by intracellular signal transduction elicited by TF/factor VIIa (FVIIa) interaction, but the details of this signaling remain largely obscure. In this study, we show that FVIIa/TF-interaction produces STAT5 phosphorylation, STAT5 nuclear translocation and transactivation of a STAT5 reporter construct. FVIIa-dependent STAT5 activation was dependent on FVIIa proteolytic activity but not on generation of the downstream coagulation factors Xa and thrombin, nor on the TF cytoplasmic domain.

Adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate ( cAMP ), its dibutyryl derivative (Db- cAMP ) and other adenine nucleotides have been micro-injected into the hypothalamic region of the unanaesthetized cat and the effects on body temperature, and on behavioural and autonomic thermoregulatory activities observed. 2. Db- cAMP and cAMP both produced hypothermia when applied to the pre-optic anterior hypothalamus. With Db- cAMP the hypothermia was shown to be dose dependent between 50 and 500 mug (0-096-0-96 mumole). 3. AMP, ADP and ATP also produced hypothermia when injected into the pre-optic anterior hypothalamus. 4. The order of relative potencies of the adenine nucleotides with respect both to the hypothermia produced and to the autonomic thermoregulatory effects observed were similar. Db- cAMP was most potent and cAMP least. 5. Micro-injection into the pre-optic anterior hypothalamus of many substances including saline produced in most cats a non-specific rise in body temperature apparently the result of tissue damage. Intraperitoneal injection of 4-acetamidophenol (paracetamol 50 mg/kg) reduced or abolished this febrile response. 6.

The TP63 gene, a TP53 homologue, encodes for two main isoforms by different promoters: one retains (TA) and the other lacks (  N) the transactivation domain. p63 plays a critical role in the maintenance of basal and myoepithelial cells in ectodermally derived tissues and is implicated in tumorigenesis of several neoplastic entities. However, the biological and regulatory roles of these isoforms in salivary gland tumorigenesis remain unknown. Our results show a reciprocal expression between TA and  N isoforms in both benign and malignant salivary tumors. The most dominantly expressed were the  N isoforms, whereas the TA isoforms showed generally low levels of expression, except in a few tumors. High  Np63 expression characterized tumors with aggressive behavior, whereas tumors with high TAp63 expression were significantly smaller and less aggressive. In salivary gland cells, high expression of  Np63 led to enhanced cell migration and invasion and suppression of cell senescence independent of TAp63 and/or TP53 gene status.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Receptor-ligand interactions at the surface of the human neutrophil induce lysosomal enzyme release and the generation of O2.-, responses which are anteceded by changes in the membrane potential (delta psi) as measured by [3H]-triphenylmethylphosphonium ion distribution. Surface stimuli (immune complexes, concanavalin A) initiated a rapid (less than 10 s) hyperpolarization response by both normal and cytochalasin B-treated cells. Replacement of extracellular Na+ with either K+ or choline depressed O2.- generation and lysosomal enzyme release in neutrophils exposed to concanavalin A or immune complexes. Replacement of Na+ with K+ led to a substantial fall in resting membrane potential, whereas replacement of Na+ with choline did not. Thus, depression of O2.- generation and lysosomal enzyme release in Na+-free medium were specifically due to a lack of extracellular Na+ and not to depolarization of the membrane. Although it has been shown that extracellular Na+, and possibly an influx of Na+, is required for optimal neutrophil function, neither depolarization nor Na+ influx per se was sufficient to activate fully these cells, since the Na+ ionophore, monensin, was not an effective stimulus for beta-glucuronidase release or O2.- generation. The hyperpolarization response to neutrophils exposed to immune complexes and to concanavalin A was greatly diminished in both high [K+] and [choline] buffers. Thus, extracellular Na+ was required for an optimal membrane potential response to receptor-ligand interaction.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Isotope dilution studies of ketone body (KB) turnover have usually been performed using a single 14C tracer and the so called 'combined KB specific activity'. By definition, this approach does not allow to evaluate the individual kinetics of acetoacetate (AcAc) and 3-hydroxybutyrate ( R-BHB ) which is feasible only using the separate administration of 14C tracer AcAc and R-BHB. In the present study we followed a different approach using the simultaneous administration in vivo of [1,2,13C2] AcAc and m [1,2,3,4(13)C4] R-BHB which allows to evaluate the individual kinetics of the two KB in the some study, thus minimizing the magnitude of blood sampling and the potential changes in the metabolic conditions of each subject. The four isotopic 13C/12C KB ratios of AcAc and R-BHB tracer and tracee blood concentrations along with the fluorimetric measurement of 12C concentrations were determined in each blood sample. Using compartmental analysis following single dose bolus injection the production rate of KB was 206 +/- 57 mumol/min/1.73 m2 (mean +/- SD). The turnover rate of KB using noncompartmental analysis, during continuous infusion in a separate study was 294 +/- 41. The plasma clearance rates of AcAc and R-BHB were 1966 +/- 502 and 1443 +/- ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively.

There is much evidence suggesting that the mesoamygdala dopaminergic (DAergic) system plays a crucial role in the formation and expression of fear conditioning, with both D1 and D2 receptors being involved. In addition, cannabinoid CB1 receptor ( CB1 R) signaling modulates DAergic pathways. The present study sought to determine the involvement of basolateral amygdala (BLA) dopamine receptors in arachidonylcyclopropylamide ( ACPA )-induced fear learning deficits. Context- and tone-dependent fear conditioning in adult male NMRI mice was evaluated. Pre-training intraperitoneal administration of ACPA (0.1 mg/kg) decreased the percentage of freezing in context- or tone-dependent fear conditioning, suggesting an acquisition impairment. Pre-training intra-BLA microinjection of a subthreshold dose of SKF38393 (D1-like receptor agonist), SCH23390 (D1-like receptor antagonist), quinpirole (D2-like receptor agonist), or sulpiride (D2-like receptor antagonist) did not alter the context-dependent fear learning deficit induced by ACPA, while SKF38393 or quinpirole restored ACPA effect on tone-dependent fear learning.

The Ca (2+) sensitizer levosimendan ( LEV ) improves myocardial contractility by enhancing the sensitivity of the contractile apparatus to Ca (2+). In addition, LEV promotes Ca (2+) entry through L-type channels in human cardiac myocytes. In this study, which was performed using microdialysis, infusion of LEV at 0.25 microM for 160 min increased dopamine (DA) concentrations (up to fivefold baseline) in dialysates from the striatum of freely moving rats. Ca (2+) omission from the perfusion fluid abolished baseline DA release and greatly decreased LEV -induced DA release. Reintroduction of Ca (2+) in the perfusion fluid restored LEV -induced DA release. Chelation of intracellular Ca (2+) by co-infusing 1,2-bis (o-amino-phenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetra (acetoxymethyl) ester (BAPTA-AM, 0.2 mM) did not affect basal DA release and scarcely affected LEV -induced increases in dialysate DA. In addition, co-infusion of the L-type ( Ca (v) 1.1-1.3) voltage-sensitive Ca (2+)-channel inhibitor nifedipine failed to inhibit LEV -induced increases in dialysate DA, which, in contrast, was inhibited by co-infusion of the N-type ( Ca (v) 2.2) voltage-sensitive Ca (2+)-channel inhibitor omega-conotoxin GVIA.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We previously reported that angiotensin II (Ang II) increases adipocyte fatty acid synthesis and triglyceride content. Triglyceride stores or adiposity correlate positively with the amount of circulating leptin. Ang II was proposed to increase adipocyte differentiation and growth by promoting prostaglandin (PG) production. The purpose of this study was to determine whether Ang II increases leptin secretion via a PG-dependent mechanism. Physiologic doses of Ang II significantly increased leptin secretion by 3T3-L1 adipocytes and human adipocytes. Elevation of PG secretion s was elicited at physiologic concentrations of Ang II (P  0.05). Secretions of 6-keto PGF(1alpha), a stable derivative of PGI(2), and PGE(2) were induced by physiologic concentrations of Ang II in a time-responsive fashion (P  0.05). Inhibition of PG synthesis by indomethacin and aspirin significantly suppressed basal as well as Ang II-induced PG levels, but did not significantly affect basal and Ang II-induced leptin secretion.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

In murine Schistosomiasis mansoni, granuloma eosinophils make SP. We investigated whether SP affects lymphokine secretion in murine schistosomiasis. SP at > or = 10(-10) M, and other tachykinins at much higher concentrations, substantially increased IFN-gamma secretion from spleen or granuloma inflammatory cells primed in vitro by suboptimal stimulatory concentrations of egg Ag or mitogen. Cells receiving maximal antigenic or mitogenic stimulation were affected marginally. Also, tachykinins induced no IFN-gamma from resting cells receiving no Ag or mitogen stimulation. There are three distinct tachykinin receptors, called NK-1, NK-2 and NK-3. SP binds the NK-1 receptor with highest affinity. Specific NK-1 receptor antagonists blocked all tachykinin-induced, IFN-gamma secretion. An NK-2 receptor inhibitor had no effect. Thus, SP and other tachykinins were acting through an NK-1 receptor. Inflammatory cells from 4-day-old granulomas cultured in vitro secrete IFN-gamma. Yet, there was no measurable IFN-gamma when SP receptor antagonists were added to the cultures. Moreover, animals treated in vivo with the NK-1 receptor antagonist CP-96,345 produced smaller granulomas. This suggested that endogenous SP may be necessary for normal induction of granuloma IFN-gamma secretion and a normal granulomatous response. Granuloma macrophages make somatostatin (SOM) that can decrease IFN-gamma secretion. Yet, IFN-gamma secretion was unaffected when both SP and SOM were in the cell cultures.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The mechanisms of the progesterone ( P4 )-activated Ca2+ influx and the relationship between the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and the acrosome reaction ( AR ) were investigated in this study. We compared the [Ca2+]i of uncapacitated and capacitated human sperm populations in response to P4 stimulation; characterized the effects of the pharmacological agents pimozide and mibefradil, inhibitors of T-type voltage-operated calcium channels (VOCCT), on the P4 -activated Ca2+ influx; and determined the effects of these drugs on the P4 -initiated AR. Since pimozide can also inhibit calmodulin-dependent enzymes, we examined the effects of the calmodulin antagonist, calmidazolium, on the above-mentioned events. The basal [Ca2+]i and the amplitude of the P4 -activated Ca2+ influx were significantly (p  0.05) higher in capacitated sperm populations. Also, in capacitated sperm populations, all three pharmacological agents significantly (p  0.05) inhibited the P4 -activated Ca2+ influx (IC50): calmidazolium (0.7 microM) > pimozide (8 microM) > mibefradil (11 microM). By contrast, the effects of these drugs on the P4 -initiated AR were varied: pimozide (10 and 20 microM) significantly (p  0.05) increased the percentage of AR spermatozoa, calmidazolium was without effect, and mibefradil (20 microM) significantly (p  0.05) inhibited the AR.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We have used membrane capacitance measurements and carbon-fiber amperometry to assay exocytosis triggered by photorelease of caged Ca (2+) to directly measure the Ca (2+) sensitivity of exocytosis from the INS-1 insulin -secreting cell line. We find heterogeneity of the Ca (2+) sensitivity of release in that a small proportion of granules makes up a highly Ca (2+)-sensitive pool (HCSP), whereas the bulk of granules have a lower sensitivity to Ca (2+). A substantial HCSP remains after brief membrane depolarization, suggesting that the majority of granules with high sensitivity to Ca (2+) are not located close to Ca (2+) channels. The HCSP is enhanced in size by glucose, cAMP, and a phorbol ester, whereas the Ca (2+)-sensitive rate constant of exocytosis from the HCSP is unaffected by cAMP and phorbol ester. The effects of cAMP and phorbol ester on the HCSP are mediated by PKA and PKC, respectively, because they can be blocked with specific protein kinase inhibitors. The size of the HCSP can be enhanced by glucose even in the presence of high concentrations of phorbol ester or cAMP, suggesting that glucose can increase granule pool sizes independently of activation of PKA or PKC. The effects of PKA and PKC on the size of the HCSP are not additive, suggesting they converge on a common mechanism. Ca rbon-fiber amperometry was used to assay quantal exocytosis of serotonin (5-HT) from insulin -containing granules following preincubation of INS-1 cells with 5-HT and a precursor.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The isolated superior mesenteric arterial bed of the rat, perfused with Krebs-Henseleit solution containing 10 microM indomethacin, was used to study the effects of reducing dissolved O2 tension on the pressor responses to endothelin-1, endothelin-3 and sarafotoxin S6b. The modulation of these responses by the endothelium was investigated by removing the intima with the detergent CHAPS and, for endothelin-1, by inhibiting nitric oxide production with N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Comparison was made with the effects of lowering O2 tension on the pressor responses to noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine. 2. Lowering the perfusate O2 tension from 551 +/- 2 mmHg to 14.0 +/- 0.5 mmHg did not change the ED50 for endothelin-1 but its maximal responses (Rmax) were increased by 2.1 and 2.7 fold, respectively, in the presence and absence of endothelium. The Rmax values for endothelin-3 were also greater in hypoxia either in the presence (by 2.3 fold) or absence of the endothelium (by 1.6 times) but those for sarafotoxin S6b were only enhanced significantly by hypoxia in the absence of the intima. hypoxia reduced the potencies of endothelin-3 and sarafotoxin S6b whether or not endothelium was present. 3. Endothelial destruction, whether in hypoxic or oxygenated conditions, increased the Rmax values for endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 ; at both O2 tensions those for endothelin-3 increased more than those for endothelin-1.

The oxygen required to meet metabolic needs of all tissues is delivered by the erythrocyte, a small, flexible cell, which, in mammals, is devoid of a nucleus and mitochondria. Despite its simple appearance, this cell has an important role in its own distribution, enabling the delivery of oxygen to precisely meet localized metabolic need. When an erythrocyte enters in a hypoxic area, a signalling pathway is activated within the cell resulting in the release of ATP in amounts adequate to activate purinergic receptors on vascular endothelium, which trigger secretion of nitric oxide and other factors resulting in vasodilatation. Among other mechanisms, binding of deoxyhemoglobin to the cytoplasmic domain of the anion-exchange protein band 3 is probably involved in this pathway. The present study investigates the effect of amyloid beta peptide exposure on this molecular mechanism. We report that deoxygenated human erythrocytes fail to release ATP following 24 h exposure to amyloid beta peptide. Concurrently, amyloid beta peptide induces caspase 3 activation. Preincubation of amyloid beta peptide treated erythrocytes with a specific inhibitor of caspase 3 prevents amyloid-induced caspase 3 activation and restores the erythrocyte's ability to release ATP under deoxygenated conditions. Since the activity of red cell phosphofructokinase, a key step in glycolytic flux, is not modified within the red cell following amyloid peptide exposure, it is likely that ATP release reduction is not dependent on glycolytic flux alterations. It has also been suggested that the heterotrimeric G protein, Gi, and adenylyl cyclase are downstream critical components of the pathway responsible for ATP release.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We have investigated the mechanism by which the replacement of a Na(+)-rich medium by a K(+)-rich medium causes an increase in the apparent affinity of glucokinase (hexokinase IV or D) for glucose in isolated hepatocytes [Bontemps, F., Hue, L. & Hers, H. G. (1978) Biochem. J. 174, 603-611]. The stimulatory effect of a K(+)-rich medium on the rate of glucose phosphorylation, as assessed by the release of tritium from [2-3H]glucose, was only partially additive with the effect of fructose, suggesting that it was also due to a decrease in the inhibition exerted on glucokinase by its regulatory protein. Measurements of metabolites indicated that the effect of the K(+)-rich medium was neither due to the formation of fructose 1-phosphate, nor to changes in the concentrations of fructose 6-phosphate or Pi, two other effectors of the regulatory protein. Replacement of Na+ by K+ in the medium resulted in a time-dependent and dose-dependent increase in cell volume that paralleled the changes in the rate of detritiation observed at 5 mM glucose. The water and chloride contents, estimated using radiolabelled compounds, were threefold and tenfold higher, respectively, in K+ cells than in Na+ cells, and the intracellular Cl- concentration about threefold higher (94 versus 29 meq/l). The effects of the K(+)-rich medium on cell volume, Cl- concentration and rate of detritiation were greatly reduced by including 80 mM trehalose or sucrose in the medium at the start of the incubation. Addition of trehalose to cells incubated for 45-50 min in the K(+)-rich medium caused an immediate decrease in cell volume whereas the rate of detritiation and the Cl- concentration underwent a transient increase followed by a decrease.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The present study examines the role of thyroid cell injury in the initiation of autoimmune thyroiditis by iodine in Obese strain (OS) chickens, a strain genetically susceptible to spontaneous autoimmune thyroiditis. OS and normal strain chickens were placed on an iodine depletion regimen started in ovo. This regimen is known to prevent thyroiditis in OS chickens. The chickens were injected with NaI every 24 h for up to 7 days starting at 3 weeks of age. Both strains showed evidence of mild thyrocyte injury 12 h after NaI. However, significant and sustained infiltration, beginning 24 h after NaI, was seen only in the OS. The infiltrating cells were primarily mononuclear. Polymorphonuclear cells were not observed. Immunohistological analysis showed the infiltrate to be composed of CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells, B cells, and macrophages in the ratio 40:20:22:17. The infiltration was sustained and progressive for at least 7 days. Thyroid infiltration after NaI repletion was significantly reduced in OS chickens tolerized to thyroglobulin at hatching. Prior treatment with the antioxidant drug ethoxyquin completely prevented both the thyrocyte injury and the infiltration induced by iodine. Treatment with antioxidant drugs had no effect on the uptake and incorporation of iodine by the thyroid. In summary, 1) iodine caused thyrocyte injury in both OS and normal chickens. 2) The injury was followed by cellular infiltration in the OS but not in normal chickens. 3) The infiltration appeared to be immune mediated in being primarily lymphocytic and at least partially thyroglobulin sensitive. 4) Prevention of thyroid injury by antioxidant drug treatment also prevented infiltration.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The BAL procoagulant activity was increased at 1, 2, and 4 wk after bleomycin challenge compared with that in control subjects, and it was capable of shortening the recalcification times of plasmas deficient in factor VII and factor VIII but not in factor X. This profile suggested the presence in BAL of an activator of factor X. Activation of purified human factor X by BAL was demonstrated by measuring the amidolytic activity of the generated factor X a on its N-benzoyl-L-isoleucyl L-glutamyl-glycyl-L-argenine-p-nitroanilide substrate. Factor X activating activity was increased in BAL at 2 wk after bleomycin challenge. Cleavage of 125I-labeled human factor X by BAL from bleomycin-challenged marmosets yielded a 55,500 Mr product that comigrated with factor X a, the appearance of which correlated strongly with amidolytic evidence of factor X a activity. Electron microscopy of the lungs of animals from all groups revealed pulmonary fibrin deposition at 2 wk after bleomycin challenge, at the time of increased BAL procoagulant and factor X activating activity.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Acute liver injury is a clinical hallmark of endotoxemia regarding the features of septic organ failure. In this process, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 are key contributors for eliciting pro- and anti-inflammatory responses, respectively. In contrast, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) provides a defense mechanism against endotoxemia by controlling the IL-6/ IL-10 balance, but how higher levels of HO-1 are sustained under pathological conditions remains unknown. Using a mouse model of endotoxemia, we provide evidence to show that hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) enhances HO-1 expression in macrophages, thereby up-regulating IL-10 and down-regulating IL-6 productions. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice manifested acute liver injury similar to that observed in septic patients, while administration of recombinant HGF enhanced expression of HO-1 by hepatic macrophages in vivo. As a result, HGF blocked the onset of hepatic injuries in LPS-treated mice. More importantly, when an HO-1 inhibitor (Sn-PP) was administered with HGF into LPS-treated mice, the protective effects of HGF against hepatic injury were attenuated. Furthermore, Sn-PP partially restored the HGF -mediated decrease in plasma IL-6 levels, while it inhibited the HGF -stimulated increase in plasma IL-10 levels. In the culture of macrophages (Raw264.7), HGF enhanced the LPS-mediated HO-1 induction, and this effect was abolished by cycloheximide, but not by actinomycin-D, thus suggesting that a post-transcriptional pathway is involved in HGF -mediated up-regulation of HO-1.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

We herein report a rare case of solitary fibrous tumor ( SFT ) producing high-molecular-weight insulin-like growth factor II(big IGF-II ). A 51-year-old woman with a large mass in the right thorax suffered from repeated loss of consciousness due to hypoglycemic attack. A hematological examination revealed low values of serum insulin and C-peptide despite her hypoglycemia. We therefore regarded her giant thoracic tumor as the cause of the hypoglycemic attack. She underwent resection of the tumor and was diagnosed with SFT pathologically. After the surgery, her blood sugar level stabilized immediately, and she has had no hypoglycemic attacks since. Although we identified big IGF-II in a preoperative serum sample by a Western immunoblot analysis, it was not detected after surgical resection. Positivity for big IGF-II was observed in the tumor cells by immunohistochemical staining.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Quinine is a bitter alkaloid that is used as a flavoring agent in tonic water. Studies suggest that quinine can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 ( CYP2D6 ) which could have implications for the metabolism of co-ingested drugs. We conducted a study with 11 healthy volunteers (7 men, 4 women; aged 26-54). After urinary void, each subject consumed either 1000 ml of carbonated water or 1000 ml of tonic water containing 80 mg quinine in a crossover design. Following each beverage subjects ingested an oral dose of 30 mg dextromethorphan (DM). Urine was collected for 8 h and analyzed for DM and dextrophran, its CYP2D6 mediated metabolite. The ratio of DM and its metabolite is an established measure of CYP2D6 activity. All subjects metabolized the vast majority of DM to its metabolite after both the carbonated water and the tonic water. The ratio (mean+/-S.D.) of DM to its metabolite was 0.013+/-0.028 after the carbonated water and 0.032+/-0.067 after the quinine containing water.

Although hypothermia is one of the most powerful modulators that can reduce ischemic injury, the effects of hypothermia on the function of the cardiac autonomic nerves in vivo are not well understood. We examined the effects of hypothermia on the myocardial interstitial norepinephrine (NE) and ACh releases in response to acute myocardial ischemia and to efferent sympathetic or vagal nerve stimulation in anesthetized cats. We induced acute myocardial ischemia by coronary artery occlusion. Compared with normothermia (n = 8), hypothermia at 33 degrees C (n = 6) suppressed the ischemia-induced NE release [63 nM (SD 39) vs. 18 nM (SD 25), P  0.01] and ACh release [11.6 nM (SD 7.6) vs. 2.4 nM (SD 1.3), P  0.01] in the ischemic region. Under hypothermia, the coronary occlusion increased the ACh level from 0.67 nM (SD 0.44) to 6.0 nM (SD 6.0) (P  0.05) and decreased the NE level from 0.63 nM (SD 0.19) to 0.40 nM (SD 0.25) (P  0.05) in the nonischemic region.

Dichlorobenzamil, phenamil and other amiloride analogs (1-100 microM) elicit transient tension in rabbit skinned muscle fibers. Tension requires preloading of Ca (2+) into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, is facilitated by low-[Mg(2+)] solutions, abolished by ruthenium red or by functional disruption of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and is followed by inhibition of the caffeine -evoked tension. Bilayer recording of Cs(+) currents through the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca (2+) release channel reveals that phenamil (10-100 microM) increases the open channel probability, whereas dichlorobenzamil affects the channel activity in a complex concentration- and time-dependent manner: stimulation occurs throughout exposure to 10 microM, but is followed by channel blockade when 100 microM dichlorobenzamil is used.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Kiss-1 has been identified as a putative metastasis suppressor gene in various human malignancies. However, there is little information about its possible role in gastric carcinoma. In this study, we determined whether the Kiss-1 gene negatively regulates MMP-9 expression. cDNA microarray technology was used to identify the genes associated with metastasis by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in the gastric cancer cell lines, NUGC-3 and MKN-28. The levels of Kiss-1 RNA and protein were confirmed to be upregulated in HGF-treated gastric cancer cells. HGF induced Kiss-1 and MMP-9 production in a dose-dependent manner. In order to investigate roles of HGF signaling in tumor progression and metastasis, we measured effects of a specific MEK1 inhibitor (PD 098059) and a p38 kinase inhibitor (SB 203580) on HGF-mediated cell proliferation and MMP-9. Pretreatment with PD 098059 reduced MMP-9 and HGF-mediated cell proliferation, but increased Kiss-I expression. In contrast, SB 203580 pretreatment enhanced MMP-9 and cell prolifera-tion, but decreased Kiss-1 expression. Cotreatment of PD098059 and SB203580 increased the p38 phosphorylation stimulated by HGF. These results suggest that the HGF-mediated Kiss-1 overexpression is regulated mainly by the p38 activation and, furthermore, the activation of ERK might affect HGF-mediated Kiss-1 expression indirectly by the regulation of p38 kinase. Consistent with this result, p38 phosphorylation was strongly repressed by the knock-down of Kiss-1. Downregulation of Kiss-1 using Kiss-1 shRNA also increased in vitro cell invasion.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The aim of this study was to identify, in cultured human cervical fibroblasts, the mechanisms by which interleukin (IL)-1beta induces the synthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) and to explore the putative role of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) in this process. Exposure of the cells for 24 h to IL-1beta induced a significant (P  0.05) dose-dependent increase in GAG synthesis. IL-1beta (1 ng/ml) induced the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein 6 h after treatment, accompanied by a 7.5-fold increase in PGE(2) production. We confirmed that NS398, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, dose-dependently blocked PGE(2) augmentation following IL-1beta treatment. AH23848, the selective EP(4) receptor antagonist, completely abolished IL-1beta -induced GAG synthesis, whereas AH6809, an EP(2) receptor antagonist, had no effect on the stimulatory effects of IL-1beta. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 6 h exposure to IL-1beta induced a notable increase in EP(4) receptor mRNA expression and a decrease in EP(1) receptor mRNA but had no effect on the expression of EP(2) and EP(3) receptor transcripts.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

In this study, we have examined dog and rabbit airways as potential models for human airways in regard to the activity of endothelin. The receptors involved in the response to endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) in airway tissue from human, rabbit, and dog lung were investigated, as was the mechanism responsible for the contraction to ET-1 in tissue from the three species. By using specific endothelin receptor agonists and antagonists, we have demonstrated that ETB receptors predominate in rabbit and human airways and ETA receptors in dog airways. The contraction to ET-1 is not dependent on cyclooxygenase products of arachidonic acid, as indomethacin had no effect on the response to ET-1. Extracellular calcium influx via voltage-dependent channels is necessary for contraction to ET-1 in rabbit and dog airways. These results are in contrast to our previously reported results in human airways, in which neither removal of extracellular calcium nor verapamil affected the ET-1 response. The sustained phase of the contraction to ET-1 in all three species may be mediated in part by activation of protein kinase C (PKC), as the inhibitor staurosporine significantly altered the time course of the response to endothelin.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The ion transport system responsible for intracellular pH ( pHi ) regulation in squid giant axons was examined in experiments with pH-sensitive microelectrodes and isotopic fluxes of Na+ and Cl-. In one study, axons were acid-loaded and the rate of the subsequent pHi recovery was used to calculate the acid extrusion rate. There was an absolute dependence of acid extrusion on external Na+, external HCO-3 (at constant pH), and internal Cl-. Furthermore, the dependence of the acid extrusion rate on each of these three parameters was described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Acid extrusion was stimulated by an acid pHi, required internal ATP, and was blocked by external 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (SITS). Under a standard set of conditions (i.e., [HCO-3]o = 12 mM, pHo = 8.00, [Na+]o = 425 mM, [ Cl- ]i = 150 mM, [ATP]i = 4 mM, pHi = 6.5, and 16 degrees C), the mean acid extrusion rate was 7.5 pmol X cm-2 X s-1. In a second study under the above standard conditions, the unidirectional Na+ efflux (measured with 22Na) mediated by the pHi -regulating system was found to be approximately 0, whereas the mean influx was about 3.4 pmol X cm-2 X s-1. This net influx required external HCO-3, internal Cl-, and acid pHi, internal ATP, and was blocked by SITS. In the final series of experiments under the above standard conditions, the unidirectional Cl- influx (measured with 36Cl) mediated by the pHi -regulating system was found to be approximately 0, whereas the mean efflux was approximately 3.9 pmol X cm-2 X s-1.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Recent studies by Boesch et al. have demonstrated that a nonimmunosuppressive cyclosporin analog, SDZ PSC 833 (an analog of cyclosporin D), is an active multidrug-resistance modifier that is at least 10 times more potent than cyclosporin A. In vitro accumulation and cytotoxicity experiments using daunorubicin ( DNR ) and vincristine (VCR) under the influence of SDZ PSC 833 and cyclosporin A were performed in wild-type (EHR2) and the corresponding highly DNR -resistant (about 80-fold) Ehrlich ascites tumor cells (EHR2/ DNR +). In accumulation experiments, both SDZ PSC 833 and cyclosporin A were found to reverse the multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype, but to the same degree at equimolar concentrations. Thus, in EHR2/ DNR + cells, both cyclosporins at 5 micrograms/ml enhanced DNR and VCR accumulation to sensitive levels, but only a negligible effect on DNR accumulation in the drug-sensitive cells was seen. In the clonogenic assay, the cytotoxicity of the two modulators was equal. The lethal dose for 50% of the cell population (LD50) was approx. 7 micrograms/ml for both compounds, and no toxicity was observed at concentrations below 2 micrograms/ml. At nontoxic doses, both cyclosporins effectively increased the cytotoxicity of DNR and VCR in a concentration-dependent manner.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is a key event in cancer metastasis, which confers cancer cells with increased motility and invasiveness, and EMT is characterized by loss of epithelial marker E-cadherin and gain of mesenchymal marker N-cadherin. Transforming growth factor- (TGF-) signaling is a crucial inducer of EMT in various types of cancer. Ski is an important negative regulator of TGF- signaling, which interacts with SMADs to repress TGF- signaling activity. Although there is accumulating evidence that Ski functions as a promoter or suppressor in human types of cancer, the molecular mechanisms by which Ski affects TGF--induced EMT and invasion in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are not largely elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the mechanistic role of Ski in NSCLC metastasis. Ski was significantly reduced in metastatic NSCLC cells or tissues when compared with non-metastatic NSCLC cells or tissues. Moreover, following TGF- stimulation Ski -silenced A549 cells had more significant features of EMT and a higher invasive activity when compared with A549 cells overexpressing Ski. Mechanistically, Ski -silenced and overexpressed A549 cells showed an increase and a reduction in the SMAD3 phosphorylation level, respectively. This was supported by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) promoter activity obtained in Ski -silenced and overexpressed A549 cells.

To characterize the poorly understood mechanisms of intracellular transport of bile acids, fluorescein isothiocyanate-glycocholate was synthesized and its ring-OH-linked structure established by fast atom bombardment, mass spectroscopy and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance. Biliary secretion of fluorescein isothiocyanate-glycocholate and [14C]-labeled glycocholate in rats was similar, in contrast to the biliary secretion of sodium fluorescein and methylamine-conjugated fluorescein isothiocyanate, which are non-bile acid organic anions. After incubation of cultured hepatocyte doublets with fluorescein isothiocyanate-glycocholate, serial quantitative image analysis of fluorescence was performed in the cellular cytoplasm, perinuclear zone and bile canaliculus. Uptake of fluorescein isothiocyanate-glycocholate into the cytoplasm was inhibited by removal of sodium from the medium and by addition of glycocholate or taurocholate. After preincubation with colchicine, but not lumicolchicine, the proportion of perinuclear to cytoplasmic fluorescein isothiocyanate-glycocholate increased during incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-glycocholate.

To compare the readings of blood pressure by the Riva-Rocci (RR) method with those of peripheral arterial pressure (PAP) as recorded by the Finapres (FP) device, exercise was performed by six male subjects on a cycle ergometer at a constant exercise intensity of 140 W. In addition, forearm volume was determined by impedance plethysmography. At rest, systolic FP values exceeded RR values by greater than or equal to 10 mmHg. During 60-min exercise both values at first increased almost in parallel with each other. While RR reached a plateau after 3 min, FP then started to decrease continuously up to the 10th min and finally stabilized at 20-30 mmHg below RR. The impedance values showed a similar declining slope, indicating vasodilatation. To separate the effects of sympathetic drive from heat elicited vasodilatation, a second experimental series was performed with ischaemic static calf exercise (5 min, 90 N), since this increases the sympathetic tone but prevents systemic heat distribution. In contrast to findings reported from intra-arterial measurements, no exercise effect on the pulse pressure amplification was obtained. However, the heat ing of one fingertip distal to the FP-cuff led to a significant decrease in PAP compared to the control recording made simultaneously from the other hand.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and second mitochondrial-derived activator of caspase ( Smac ) are two important prognostic biomarkers for cancer. They are negatively correlated in many types of cancer. However, their relationship is still unknown in lung cancer. In the present study, we found that there was a negative correlation between Smac and XIAP at the level of protein but not mRNA in NSCLC patients. However, XIAP overexpression had no effect on degrading endogenous Smac in lung cancer cell lines. Therefore, we constructed plasmids with full length of Smac (fSmac) and mature Smac (mSmac) which located in cytoplasm instead of original mitochondrial location, and was confirmed by immunofluorescence. Subsequently, we found that mSmac rather than fSmac was degraded by XIAP and inhibited cell viability. CHX chase assay and ubiquitin assay were performed to illustrate XIAP degraded mSmac through ubiquitin pathway. Overexpression of XIAP partially reverted apoptotic induction and cell viability inhibition by mSmac, which was due to inhibiting caspase-3 activation.

RIN1 was originally identified by its ability to inhibit activated Ras and likely participates in multiple signaling pathways because it binds c-ABL and 14-3-3 proteins, in addition to Ras. RIN1 also contains a region homologous to the catalytic domain of Vps9p-like Rab guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Here, we show that this region is necessary and sufficient for RIN1 interaction with the GDP-bound Rabs, Vps21p, and Rab5A. RIN1 is also shown to stimulate Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange, Rab5A-dependent endosome fusion, and EGF receptor-mediated endocytosis. The stimulatory effect of RIN1 on all three of these processes is potentiated by activated Ras.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Aluminium toxicity in dialysis patients is associated with a relative parathyroid hormone (PTH) deficiency as well as osteomalacia. In-vitro studies of parathyroid cells have shown that aluminium inhibits PTH secretion. However, only limited data are available on how aluminium affects the development of hyperparathyroidism in the azotaemic animal. Four groups of azotaemic rats were studied; in each group, renal failure was induced by a two-stage 5/6 nephrectomy, after which rats were studied for 40 days. In three groups hyperparathyroidism was stimulated by the use of a high phosphorus (1.2%) diet (HPD). The four groups were (1) HPD; (2) HPD + high-dose aluminium (HDAL)--1.5 mg of aluminium was administered intraperitoneally (IP) 5 days per week; (3) HPD + low-dose aluminium (LDAL)--0.5 mg of aluminium was administered IP 5 days per week; and (4) moderate phosphorus (0.6%) diet (MPD); the MPD group was used to control hyperparathyroidism and thus provide a comparison of PTH levels and azotaemic bone disease. After 40 days, the serum PTH level was higher (P  0.05) in the HPD + HDAL group (37 +/- 2 pmol/l) than the HPD, HPD + LDAL, and MPD groups (24 +/- 3, 28 +/- 4, and 6 +/- 1 pmol/l respectively). The correlation between serum PTH and calcium, serum PTH and phosphorus, and serum calcium and phosphorus was significant for the four groups (P  0.02); however, the relationship between serum PTH and calcium, and between serum calcium and phosphorus was altered in the HPD + HDAL group (serum aluminium 30.8 +/- 2 mumol/l).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Conformational changes within the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) surface glycoprotein gp120 result from binding to the lymphocyte surface receptors and trigger gp41-mediated virus/cell membrane fusion. The triggering of fusion requires cleavage of two of the nine disulfide bonds of gp120 by a cell-surface protein disulfide-isomerase ( PDI ). Soluble glycosaminoglycans such as heparin and heparan sulfate bind gp120 via V3 and, possibly, a CD4-induced domain. They exert anti-HIV activity by interfering with the HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env)/cell-surface interaction. Env also binds cell-surface glycosaminoglycans. Here, using surface plasmon resonance, we observed an inverse relationship between heparin binding by gp120 and its thiol content. In vitro, and in conditions in which gp120 could bind CD4, heparin and heparan sulfate reduced PDI -mediated gp120 reduction by approximately 80%. Interaction of Env with the surface of lymphocytes treated using sodium chlorate, an inhibitor of glycosaminoglycan synthesis, led to gp120 reduction.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

It has been postulated that renal prostaglandins ( PG s) function as negative feedback inhibitors of the action of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), implying a correlation between levels of ADH and the rate of renal PG synthesis. These studies have evaluated the relationship between renal PG synthesis and hormone levels in rats with hereditary diabetes insipidus, a species devoid of circulating ADH. Since vasoconstrictor agents can stimulate renal PG synthesis by mechanisms unrelated to antidiuretic activity, deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin ( dDAVP ) was utilized for replacement therapy instead of arginine vasopressin, which has considerable pressor activity. dDAVP was administered by S.C. implanted osmotic minipumps to obtain steady states of dDAVP at different dose levels. As indices of renal PG synthesis, urinary excretion of PG E2 and PG F2 alpha were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. PG E2 excretion, although increased by dDAVP treatment, was not correlated with dose of dDAVP. However, PG F2 alpha excretion was highly correlated with dose of dDAVP (r = 0.97, P less than.01). The sum ( PG E2 + PG F2 alpha), which may more accurately reflect total medullary PG synthesis, was also significantly correlated with dose of dDAVP (r = 0.98, P less than.001).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Hyperphosphatemia leads to the development of osteitis fibrosa in patients with chronic renal failure. In contrast, crippling osteomalacia may appear in uremic patients who are hypophosphatemic or aluminum intoxicated or who undergo total or subtotal parathyroidectomy. Thus, strict phosphorus control by use of aluminum -containing gels may ameliorate renal osteitis fibrosa, but may potentiate the development of osteomalacia. To evaluate this possibility, we compared the bone histologies of 10 chronic renal hemodialysis patients who consistently maintained predialysis phosphorus levels between 4-5 mg/dl (Strict-P) to those of 46 randomly selected dialysis patients (Random-P). We found that the Strict-P group had lower circulating immunoreactive PTH (P less than 0.02) and alkaline phosphatase (P less than 0.05) levels and, as expected, less evidence of hyperparathyroid bone disease. On the other hand, the Strict-P patients had osteomalacia, as evidenced by moderate osteoid accumulation and reduced capacity of bone to assume a fluorescent tetracycline label. Furthermore, all Strict-P patients had histological evidence of bone aluminum accumulation.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

A rapid decrease in male fertility in laboratory animals exposed to 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane ( DBCP ) has been suggested to be due, in part, to a postglycolytic inhibition of sperm carbohydrate metabolism. The present studies were performed to identify the specific site of DBCP -induced inhibition of intermediary metabolism. 14CO2 generation by epididymal sperm, isolated from Fischer 344 rats, was measured using radiolabeled tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates: acetyl CoA, citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, and succinate. There was 0-28% inhibition of CO2 generation after addition of 0.5 mM DBCP and 81-98% inhibition with 3 mM DBCP, with all four substrates. The activities of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, and lactate dehydrogenase were not inhibited by DBCP. Since the DBCP -induced inhibition of metabolism of different substrates to CO2 was similar, and since DBCP did not inhibit enzyme activities of glycolysis or the TCA cycle, a common site of inhibition was suspected. In evaluations of mitochondrial electron transport chain activity, DBCP (3 mM) inhibited oxygen consumption resulting from metabolism of endogenous substrates plus alpha-ketoglutarate or malate by about 80%. When succinate, an FAD-dependent oxidation, was used as a substrate, oxygen consumption was not inhibited by DBCP.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Cardiopulmonary bypass(CPB) is associated with fluid overload. We hypothesized that fluid gain during CPB could be reduced by substituting parts of a crystalloid prime with 7.2% hypertonic saline and 6% poly (O-2-hydroxyethyl) starch solution (HyperHaes). 14 animals were randomized to a control group (Group C) or to Group H. CPB-prime in Group C was Ringer's solution. In group H, 4 ml/kg of Ringer's solution was replaced by the hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch solution. After 60 min stabilization, CPB was initiated and continued for 120 min. All animals were allowed drifting of normal temperature (39.0 degrees C) to about 35.0 degrees C. Fluid was added to the CPB circuit as needed to maintain a 300-ml level in the venous reservoir. Blood chemistry, hemodynamic parameters, fluid balance, plasma volume, fluid extravasation rate ( FER ), tissue water content and acid-base parameters were measured/calculated. Total fluid need during 120 min CPB was reduced by 60% when hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch solution was added to the CPB prime (p  0.01). The reduction was related to a lowered FER. The effect was most pronounced during the first 30 min on CPB, with 0.6 (0.43) (Group H) compared with 1.5 (0.40) ml/kg/min (Group C) (p  0.01).

Porcine circovirus type 2 ( PCV2 ) is an economically important swine pathogen. It has been shown that treatment of PCV2 -infected cells with interferon gamma (INF-gamma) or alpha (IFN-alpha) increases PCV2 replication in vitro, and that an interferon -stimulated response element (ISRE)-like sequence was identified in the PCV2 genome. To determine if the ISRE is involved in viral response to IFNs, several ISRE mutants of PCV2 were created by serial mutations of the ISRE sequence. Treatment of ISRE mutants-infected cells with IFN-gamma or IFN-alpha showed a progressive diminishment in the enhanced viral replication in correlation with increasing alterations to the ISRE sequence. To determine if the ISRE was necessary and sufficient for IFN-mediated enhancement of PCV2 replication, DNA fragments spanning the ISRE-containing promoter region of the rep gene from wildtype and ISRE-mutant PCV2 were tested in a luciferase reporter gene system. 3D4/31 cells transfected with reporter gene constructs were treated with IFN-gamma or IFN-alpha, respectively. The results showed that the untreated controls for both ISRE-mutant and wildtype PCV2 had higher levels of luciferase reporter activity than IFN-treated samples, indicating that, when removed from the context of whole viral genome, the ISRE-like activity of the sequence was lost. Furthermore, treatment with IFNs diminished the promoter activity regardless of the mutation, suggesting that other cis elements in the viral genome may be required for regulating the ISRE-mediated gene transcription.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Dendritic cells (DC) are the most potent antigen-presenting cells and during their life cycle they are exposed to different oxygen tensions. Similarly to inflamed and tumor tissues, lymphoid organs are characterized by a hypoxic microenvironment; thus, the modality by which hypoxia may affect DC is important for regulating both the quality and the intensity of the immune response. Here, we show that human monocyte-derived DC, exposed to hypoxia, expressed high levels of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1, associated with upregulation of BNIP3 and BAX expression. This was paralleled with downregulation of the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-2, enhanced caspase-3 activity and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, along with cell death. Transfection of HIF-1  siRNA protected DC from the effects of hypoxia. Of interest, when hypoxic DC were maturated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we did not observe an increased cell death, while HIF-1  accumulation and BNIP3 expression were still significantly upregulated. In contrast with immature DC, mature DC expressed higher levels of Bcl-2, and, more importantly, of phosphorylated Akt. Transfection of HIF-1  siRNA to mature DC resulted in a significant upregulation of Akt phosphorylation as well. Moreover, inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway resulted in an increased cell death of hypoxic mature DC.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Immune cells and platelets maintain plasma membrane phospholipid asymmetry. Upon activation, this asymmetry is disrupted by phospholipid scrambling (PS), which is a major step during activation of immune cells, hemostasis and apoptosis. Anoctamin 6 ( Ano6 ; TMEM16F) causes chloride (Cl(-)) and cation currents and is required for Ca (2+)-dependent PS. It is defective in blood cells from patients with Scott syndrome, a rare bleeding disorder. We examined if Cl(-) currents and PS are related, whether both processes are Ca (2+) dependent, and whether Ca (2+)-independent scrambling during intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis is controlled by Ano6. Ca (2+) increase by ionomycin activated Ano6 Cl(-) currents and PS in normal lymphocytes, but not in B-lymphocytes from two different patients with Scott syndrome. Fas ligand (FasL) did not increase intracellular Ca (2+), but activated Cl(-) currents in normal but not in Scott lymphocytes. Whole-cell currents were inhibited by Cl(-) channel blockers and by siRNA knockdown of Ano6. In contrast, intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis by ABT-737 did not induce Cl(-) currents in lymphocytes. PS was not inhibited by blockers of Ano6 or removal of Cl(-) ions.

Several studies using different animal models have demonstrated that the consumption of soya protein (SP) reduces serum cholesterol concentrations by increasing the excretion of bile acids ( BA ). However, the mechanism by which SP enhances BA excretion is not fully understood. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine whether the consumption of SP regulates the expression of key enzymes involved in hepatic BA synthesis and the transporters involved in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) via fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) and/or small heterodimer protein (SHP) in rats. To achieve this aim, four groups of rats were fed experimental diets containing 20 % casein (C) or SP with or without the addition of 02 % cholesterol and the expression of hepatic genes involved in BA synthesis and the ileal and hepatic RCT was measured. Rats fed the SP diet had higher concentrations of ileal FGF15 and hepatic FGF15 receptor (FGFR4) and increased expression of SHP and liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH1) than those fed the C diet; as a result, the excretion of faecal BA was greater. The addition of cholesterol to the diet repressed the protein abundance of FGF15 and FGFR4; however, SP increased the expression of SHP and LRH1 to a lesser extent. Nonetheless, the expression of ABCG5/8 was increased in the intestine of rats fed the SP diet, and the effect was enhanced by the addition of cholesterol to the diet.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

The composition of peripheral blood leukocyte populations was studied following experimental PCV2- infection in 3-week-old piglets. Four of 10 PCV2-infected piglets developed clinical and pathological symptoms consistent with postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) between 14 and 21 days post-inoculation (p.i. ), and were characterised as PMWS-affected. Only these four PMWS-affected piglets, but neither the non-symptomatic infected nor control animals, developed a clear leukopenia. Kinetic analysis demonstrated a clear loss of both CD21(+) B and CD3(+) T lymphocytes in the PMWS-affected piglets. By CD3/CD4/CD8 triple labelling, the influence of PCV2 infection on all T cell sub-populations was discernible. A loss of CD3(+)CD4(+)CD8(+) memory/activated Th lymphocytes was particularly notable.

Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) typically limit cytokine receptor signaling via the JAK-STAT pathway. Considerable evidence demonstrates that SOCS2 limits growth hormone (GH) action on body and organ growth. Biochemical evidence that SOCS2 binds to the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) supports the novel possibility that SOCS2 limits IGF-I action. The current study tested the hypothesis that SOCS2 normally limits basal or IGF-I- induced intestinal growth and limits IGF-IR signaling in intestinal epithelial cells. Intestinal growth was assessed in mice homozygous for SOCS2 gene deletion ( SOCS2 null) and wild-type (WT) littermates at different ages and in response to infused IGF-I or vehicle or EGF and vehicle. The effects of SOCS2 on IGF-IR signaling were examined in ex vivo cultures of SOCS2 null and WT intestine and Caco-2 cells. Compared with WT, SOCS2 null mice showed significantly enhanced small intestine and colon growth, mucosal mass, and crypt cell proliferation and decreases in radiation-induced crypt apoptosis in jejunum. SOCS2 null mice showed significantly greater growth responses to IGF-I in small intestine and colon. IGF-I- stimulated activation of IGF-IR and downstream signaling intermediates were enhanced in the intestine of SOCS2 null mice and were decreased by SOCS2 overexpression in Caco-2 cells.

Several endogenous oscillators determine circadian rhythms. One, light-entrained, is in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the others, food-entrained, are in unknown sites. To determine how the hypothalamic ventromedial nuclei ( VMN ) and feeding affect rhythms, we compared nocturnally active rats fed either ad libitum or for 2 hr/d during light [restricted feeding (RF)] and either with or without colchicine-induced disruption of VMN. We measured rhythms in temperature, locomotor activity, feeding, drinking, corticosterone, and the numbers of cells expressing c-Fos in light/dark in hypothalamic nuclei, the suprachiasmatic nuclei, and two major SCN targets, the subparaventricular zone (sPVNz) and paraventricular thalamus (pvTHAL). c-Fos cells were always light > dark in SCN, whereas the VMN and sPVNz lacked light/dark differences except after RF and RF plus VMN disruption, respectively. Controls fed ad libitum had high-amplitude rhythms and, generally, c-Fos cells dark > light. In RF controls, a c-Fos pattern dark > light occurred in VMN ; generally, c-Fos cell numbers increased elsewhere maintaining dark > light. By contrast, levels of corticosterone peaked before food. In rats fed ad libitum, VMN with colchicine markedly reduced rhythm amplitudes, not phase. c-Fos patterns were abolished except in pvTHAL and SCN.

The maturation of mammalian oocytes in vitro can be stimulated by gonadotropins (follicle-stimulating hormone, FSH ) or their intrafollicular mediator, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like peptide-amphiregulin (AREG). We have shown previously that in pig cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs), FSH induces expression and the synthesis of AREG that binds to EGF receptor (EGFR) and activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase 3/1 (MAPK3/1) signaling pathway. However, in this study we found that FSH also caused a rapid activation of MAPK3/1 in the cumulus cells, which cannot be explained by the de novo synthesis of AREG. The rapid MAPK3/1 activation required EGFR tyrosine kinase (TK) activity, was sensitive to SRC proto-oncogene non-receptor tyrosine kinase (SRC)-family and protein kinase C ( PKC ) inhibitors, and was resistant to inhibitors of protein kinase A (PKA) and metalloproteinases. AREG also induced the rapid activation of MAPK3/1 in cumulus cells, but this activation was only dependent on the EGFR TK activity.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
We conclude that in cumulus cells, <el> FSH <le> induces a rapid activation of MAPK3/1 by the ligand-independent transactivation of EGFR, requiring SRC and <re> PKC <er> activities. positive----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----
In conclusion, our results suggest that in pig cumulus cells, FSH can rapidly activate MAPK3/1 through the activation of SRC-family and PKC. positive----- Beam Generated Explanation and Label -----

Acetylation of the histone variant H2A.Z ( H2A.Zac ) occurs at active regulatory regions associated with gene expression. Although the Tip60 complex is proposed to acetylate H2A.Z, functional studies suggest additional enzymes are involved. Here, we show that p300 acetylates H2A.Z at multiple lysines. In contrast, we found that although Tip60 does not efficiently acetylate H2A.Z in vitro, genetic inhibition of Tip60 reduces H2A.Zac in cells. Importantly, we found that interaction between the p300 -bromodomain and H4 acetylation (H4ac) enhances p300 -driven H2A.Zac. Indeed, H2A.Zac and H4ac show high genomic overlap, especially at active promoters. We also reveal unique chromatin features and transcriptional states at enhancers correlating with co-occurrence or exclusivity of H4ac and H2A.Zac. We propose that differential H4 and H2A.Z acetylation signatures can also define the enhancer state.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
In conclusion, we show both Tip60 and <el> p300 <le> contribute to <re> H2A.Zac <er> and reveal molecular mechanisms of writer/reader crosstalk between H2A.Z and H4 acetylation through <el> p300 <le>. positive----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

1. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of enhanced reactivity to 5'-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and sumatriptan previously observed in human isolated coronary arteries when active force was raised with the thromboxane A2-mimetic, U46619. 2. Ring segments of dog isolated coronary artery and saphenous vein were suspended in organ baths and cumulative concentration-contraction curves to 5-HT, sumatriptan and methysergide were constructed in the absence and presence of low concentrations of U46619. 3. In both endothelium-intact and endothelium-denuded rings of coronary artery, precontraction with U46619 to low ( 10% Fmax; the contraction to a maximum depolarizing 125 mM KCl Krebs solution; KPSS) levels of active force had no effect on either the maximum contraction or sensitivity (pEC50) to 5-HT, sumatriptan and methysergide. 4. Ketanserin (1 microM) had no effect on contractions to sumatriptan and methysergide in endothelium-denuded coronary artery rings, but reduced the maximum contraction to 5-HT by approximately 90% to a value (5% Fmax) similar to that for sumatriptan and methylsergide. Under these conditions, U46619 precontraction had no effect on either pEC50 or maximum for 5-HT, sumatriptan or methysergide. 5. In rings of saphenous vein with endothelium and treated with ketanserin (1 microM), 5-HT and sumatriptan caused equal maximum responses of 65% Fmax which were approximately double that of methysergide (32% Fmax). The maximum responses and sensitivity to 5-HT, sumatriptan, methysergide and noradrenaline were unaffected by precontraction with U46619. 6.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
In contrast, the same treatment with SNP had little affect on the contraction curve to noradrenaline.7 In conclusion, the pattern of <el> U46619 <le>-enhanced reactivity of 5-HT, sumatriptan and <re> methysergide <er> in SNP-treated dog saphenous vein, highlights the importance of functional antagonism when assessing reactivity to contractile agonists in isolated blood vessels. positive----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----
It is concluded that the enhanced reactivity to 5-HT and sumatriptan previously observed in human coronary arterial preparations with active force raised by U46619 may be due, at least partially, to an increase in the number of receptor sites on the smooth muscle cell membrane which results in increased membrane depolarization. positive----- Beam Generated Explanation and Label -----
 In conclusion, under conditions of low levels of active force (KPSS), <el> U46619 <le> did not increase the reactivity to 5-HT, sumatriptan or <re> methysergide <er>. positive

The directed expression of osteogenic transcription factors via a balanced activation of signaling pathways is an important prerequisite for the development of mineralized tissues. A positive-feedback loop of the BMP2-dependent SMAD signaling pathway and the DLX3 transcription factor (BMP2/DLX3 pathway) directs the osteogenic differentiation of periodontal precursor cells from the dental follicle (DFCs). However, little is known how this BMP2/DLX3 pathway interacts with other crucial signaling pathways such as the WNT/ -catenin signaling pathway. This study investigated the interaction between the BMP2/DLX3 pathway and the WNT pathway during the osteogenic differentiation of DFCs. BMP2 induced the WNT/ -catenin pathway in DFCs and phosphorylates -catenin via protein kinase A (PKA). Moreover, only BMP2 facilitated the binding of LEF1/SMAD4/ -catenin complex to the DLX3 promoter, while an inducer of the canonical WNT pathway, WNT3A, act as an inhibitor. Although WNT3A inhibits the osteogenic differentiation of DFCs the expression of -catenin was crucial for both the expression of DLX3 and for the osteogenic differentiation.----- True Explanation  and Label -----
In conclusion, while the activation of the canonical WNT pathway inhibits the osteogenic <re> differentiation <er> of DFCs, <el> β-catenin <le> sustains the BMP2/DLX3-mediated osteogenic <re> differentiation <er> via the activation of PKA. positive----- Greedy Generated Explanation and Label -----

Butylated hydroxytoluene ( BHT ), which has both antioxidant and membrane active properties, has been reported to affect cellular differentiation. We studied its effect on the bipotent lineage differentiation of the important HL-60 human myeloblastic leukemia cell line using reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium, cell cycle analysis, population growth rate, monoclonal antibodies, and morphology. BHT markedly accelerated retinoic acid-induced myelocytic differentiation and dihydroxyvitamin D3-induced monocytic differentiation in a concentration and time-dependent manner. Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) had a comparable effect. Preincubation with the compounds was not necessary to evoke the acceleration Other antioxidants and inhibitors of eicosanoid synthesis were inactive.----- True Explanation  and Label -----

Both prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) and LHRH inhibit LH-stimulated cAMP accumulation and progesterone secretion in the intact luteal cell, but have no effect on LH-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity in isolated membranes. The present studies were conducted to assess the possibility that calcium ( Ca2 +) may mediate the inhibitory activity of PGF2 alpha and LHRH in the rat luteal cell. Removal of extracellular Ca2 + significantly enhanced cAMP accumulation in response to LH by about 2-fold, but blunted LH-stimulated progesterone secretion. Incubation of luteal cells with A23187 caused a highly significant and dose-related decrease in LH-stimulated cAMP accumulation with a concentration for half-maximal inhibition (IC50) of about 1 microM. No effect of A23187 was seen on LH-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity, but the ionophore elicited significant inhibition of LH-stimulated intracellular cAMP accumulation in the presence of isobutyl-methylxanthine (MIX), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Inhibition by A23187 was Ca2 + dependent, since a decrease in extracellular Ca2 + to less than 100 microM completely blocked the effect of the ionophore. A23187 also significantly inhibited LH-stimulated progesterone secretion in response to LH or cholera toxin and inhibited cholera toxin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in the absence or presence of MIX. In incubations of isolated luteal membranes, Ca2 + produced a dose-dependent inhibition of LH-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in the absence or presence of MIX at free Ca2 + levels between 5-20 microM (IC50, approximately 10 microM).----- True Explanation  and Label -----

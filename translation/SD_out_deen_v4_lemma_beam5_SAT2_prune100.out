DFB CEO Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil to return to the national team.
"This is a question that of course depends on one getting into the conversation, that one also talks to him about why he apparently felt one or the other as it is stated in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasic mower" of the "Image-Newspaper".
Despite the month-long debate over Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of 92-time national player Özeil.
"I would have been pleased if Mesut Özil had continued playing for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would be so," said Grindel.
De 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified him by the fact that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to put up any pressure, but he knows it from football so that when "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a pity that this conversation has not yet come about".
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burnt
At 2.13 p.m., the professional fire brigade Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a power line leads directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, there was a risk in delay.
The fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire when it arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically in its entirety and fire debris removed to the absolutely necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden cabin, he had a battery to charge for lunch.
That might be the cause of fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the range of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire must still be determined - as must the cause of the fire.
However, it should be considerable, for the owner had many collectors' items in his garden hut.
Angry mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open street
What drove Lindsay Lohan to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has streamed live herself as she apparently wants to snatch children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and releases a partial recording of the stream.
Here you can see "Good luck kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows how Lohan gets out of a car and goes to a possibly homeless family that she wants as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees the actress, Lohan pursues her parents and children.
She accuses adults of doing child trafficking.
She doesn't give any evidence for all this in the clip.
"The whole world is watching this right now," Lohan says in the video, as she continues to follow the family along the street.
Apparently, she tries to separate the children from her parents.
Eventually, however, it seems that the obviously angry mother is enough.
Looks like she's turning around and slapping Lohan.
In tears, the actress affirms how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What prompted Lohan to do so is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is said to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to earth.
The lander Mascot will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: Number of deaths on Sulawesi increases to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there are at least 420 deaths.
The number of victims could rise further.
The rescue teams have not yet entered the devastated areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Supervisory Board Chief
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused unrest in the stock markets at the beginning of August when he announced a withdrawal of the Eletroautomaker.
The U.S. Stock Exchange Inspectorate sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Teslas chief withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he is allowed to remain CEO.
Party Congress of British Conservatives
Sharply guarded - the Tories Congress
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party congress is about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the forefront of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been quarrelling over these names for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and the population will vote on this Sunday - whether it is going well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") is Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in Brazil is divided.
Thousands went to the streets in several cities to protest Jair Bolsonaro, the right-wing populist.
The "Trump Brazil" acts as an anti-system candidate and is thus in the lead in the surveys.
His sharpest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Labor Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" finishing takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force still exists," said Peter Mertens, Chief Development Officer, to the industry journal "Automobile Week".
In December 2017, Audi CEO Rupert Stadler, who was imprisoned and on leave, announced that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"All engine/gear combinations are expected to be tested in the first quarter of 2018, he said.
Mertens said: "At the beginning of July we reached an important milestone in the process of addressing the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi parent Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made "serious organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board had adjourned a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and wants to discuss it further this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi chief of having authorised the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust gas values after they become aware of the fraud.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
At present, the company is headed by the sales director Bram Schot as acting CEO.
Due to the switch to the new exhaust gas and consumption test standard WLTP, there were production failures at Audi, said Schot the "Heilbronner Voice".
In principle, he sees a declining demand for saloons such as Audi A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel strives for re-election - Lahm should join the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run again for office as DFB President in the coming year, despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel as a guest at ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" early Sunday morning.
You have to keep trying to re-election, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
The head of the association would find it "notable" in his own words if he did not "want to work on the future project" after the match for the 2024 European Championship.
Grindel has been the head of the association since April 2016 as the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, who fell over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place at the German Federal Day on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM chief organizer Philipp Lahm will work in the DFB Bureau.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would continue to advise the Bureau in this role and then, of course, be warmly invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," said Grindel, who said: "I am very pleased that my colleagues on the Bureau agree that he will continue to be consulted in the Committee Bureau.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB boss.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future he would become a national player without a migration background.
Currently, this office is held by the Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon.
"If one without a migrant background is clearly involved in society and football and says, "the issue is important, we have to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local associations where integration must work," said Grindel.
Properly reduce with half-wise scale
I've been holding a new toy for four weeks.
A balance that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat content.
It can also show muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it's more for the sausage.
Don't tell him if I replaced fat with muscle.
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear opening successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started with a clear victory in the new season of the Bundesliga.
Against Science City Jena, the vice-champion easily won 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing match over 40 minutes.
New addition Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliner with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counter) signed from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators at his mandatory game debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won the mandatory game debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at see Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 counters.

The new gamemaker Will Cummings dominated the Oldenburgers with 25 points.
The Braunschweigers, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the Baskets quickly ensured clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement who are living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens wherever they live.
We will not allow the PKK or Gülen Movement sympathizers to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship," he said..
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the Cologne city centre was partially closed.
Several thousand police were in action - including snipers.
The Islam Association Ditib is in criticism because it is regarded as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and Schrecksekunde
Musicians like Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have promoted more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert at Central Park in New York.
"Commit wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night in front of around 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B performed in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I sweat, but it's okay, because I am here ready to change the world.
Actors like Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and relief organizations also showed up at the multi-hour spectacle on stage.
In between, however, there was a scare second when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was gunshot, scared and tried to escape.
In short, panic arose, people ran into confusion.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed people down from the stage.
"No one is trying to hurt anyone," Martin said, "but I'm not hurting anyone."
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Those who wanted to get one had to read and spread texts, photos and videos on the global fight against poverty and diseases on the Internet.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applause from the audience - shouts for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He spoke together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake spoke out for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court in the US Senate's Judiciary Committee, and thus pushed many women against their heads.
At least three women have filed abuse charges against Kavanaugh up to attempted rape, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the charges after two women, who claimed to have experienced sexual assaults themselves, confronted him on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also meet me at any time in an elevator," Flake said at the New York concert to the crowd.
Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends dismissal of journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the dismissal of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the chancellor's office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had overlaid a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had entered the front row.
The T-shirt, was not the problem, said Seibert the image on Sunday.
It was about interrupting the press conference.
The journalist's action caused a great deal of unrest, which was unacceptable.
He had arranged for personal guards to take the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns during press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely regardless of whether or not it is a legitimate concern.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are threatened with several decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are not sure about the Turkish authorities either: Only in early September was Austrian journalist Max Zirngast arrested.
Most recently, the cases of detained journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
Although they came free and could return to Germany, there are still trials in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him as fresh and handsome: Florian David Fitz.
You'll have to look at it twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for its lively conversations at the bar of the Hamburg harbour bar "Schellfishposten".
Moderator Ina Müller meets with her guests some beer, some wine or even higher-percent drinks to loosen the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also drink courage for the obligatory vocal performances.
On Friday another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time the actor Florian David Fitz is known from movies like "Männerherzen", "Terror - Ihr Bewertung" or "Der gelsten Tag".
But the trip to the far north did not get well for the Munich.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely snuffed on it, his eyes only two small slits left.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick. He's just got a big cat.
Addressed to his fans, he posted some - probably not very serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER goes to Inas night.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And spray.
And the round of egg liqueurs that Ina throws at half past half past three, leave it.
Alcohol consumption is truly written on the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips to fight the afterlife.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - probably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
It is not known how Ina Müller survived the nightly bouncing.
Since she moderates the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more proven...
To a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa struggles with vandalism and misconduct
The entry into the 36-kilometre-long railway cycle path in Red Riding Hoodland in Treysa is difficult to find and waste.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are searched for, but solutions are hardly apparent.
Shards, cigarette dumps, garbage and debris, demolished trash cans and now dismantled signposts - this is how the entrance with seating group to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for some time.
For the flagship railway bike trail in Red Riding Hoodland a more than unfamous sight.
The topic has been occupied by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, according to the bicycle traffic officer of the city Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been addressed in the cycling advisory board.
There is no solution yet.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the entrance.
"I think the latter would be the imperative of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic was also included in the local council.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place to celebrate on weekends.
Not only is it often loud, but it also destroys the layers: the posts are torn out of the ground, the trash can is demolished, the signs are folded, the seats are smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are angry that the resting place on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for drinking.
"The focus here is clearly on the Haaße hill along the entire cycle path," confirms the bicycle traffic officer, who is now also worried about the new bike park in Ziegenhain, which is opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "Possibly this sets the threshold significantly higher to attack common property.
However, this would presuppose that a police patrol will pass in time.
In principle, Wüstenhagen desires a development of the Haaße hill.
He needed to be made more attractive.
One could be very pleased with the frequenting of the cycle path so far.
Tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high quality compared to others in Germany," says the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger, ADFC member Susanne Klippert assesses the situation in Asheroder Straße in Treysa.
There's no turning trail on the Haße hill.
In case of heavy traffic, cyclists can have to wait in the middle of the road between the two-way traffic flows," she explains.
This is no problem for sporty drivers, but for older people and especially for children.
Music Contest in the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call for a music contest was a success, creative and together.
"D ein Lied für Hiltrup", is the appeal of the district offensive Hilstrup, in the "Music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family affair with coffee and cakes from the volunteers of the cultural station.
Seven groups took place, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long Albanian living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We haven't experienced this in other parts of the city.
What did the copywriters see connected to?
At the places the Hiltruper lake and the Marktallee found particularly frequent mention.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his hit song.
The Kulturbahnhof was also appreciated.
Again and again, it was about the experience of living together in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke animated the short breaks with short interviews with the interpreters or hints about her work.
Humberg learned that he had actually studied chemistry, but now he also taught guitar.
Franke knew from the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest.
And Alvin Jasic has meanwhile placed everything on YouTube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
For the favourites of the jury there was nevertheless something special - so that others can even hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Hemig with his Hiltrup hit, which particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tolle.
Like everyone else, the children performed again to the finale - and even without electronic support sounded "right good", as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, relation to Hiltrup, catchiness of melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She considered the event a complete success.
Everyone was "very happy", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The Word Game: "Decrypto" in Game Test
The players form two teams that are facing one another.
For each page there is a screen, in which four maps with keywords, which you can decipher - the old trick with the red slide - only after you put them in.
Thus it is guaranteed that the opposite side cannot read anything by mistake.
For example, the maps read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
Second window.
Three dice.
4th Festival".
These are the terms that must be encrypted from now on.
Because here we should not guess the terms, but codes.
One player per team alternates is the encryptor.
He gets a code card that might say "3.4.2.".
In "Decrypto" they should not guess the terms behind the cover, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this sequence and example - the terms "cure", "fix" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not as much as possible; because the game wins if he manages to crack the code twice.
So the encryptor notes and reads aloud: "Throw" for the cubes, "Lose" as a contrast to Fest; here, of course, something like "party" would be possible and "Prague" because he paid attention at school and knows the window crash there.
So it goes round by round, team by team.
One does not know the concepts of the opposite side - but they can be better combined with any hint the encryptor gives there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too crazy, the descriptions should be, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic to "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players probably have to study it for quite a long time and in detail until they can play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info on the web makes it easier.
But once you get started, you will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous match.
But overall "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as predecessors and genre primus "Codenames", which is also an agent theme for a game of less words, but much better to play in small groups.
And who is only concerned with guessing and not with winning points, can easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler salute and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach twice on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
He first showed Hitler's greetings in the Upper City of a passing police patrol, later he also appeared in a bar when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholized by the police, he had to spend the night in the detention cell at the Kulmbach police inspection.
In a sober state, he must then also be held liable for the use of signs of unconstitutional organisations in criminal proceedings. — 1 Cor. 12: 10.
Pressig factory was home to the Schubloks
The railway depot in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991 a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers popped on buffers, you heard it all over Pressig," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't upset anyone.
The brakes squealed and the wagons gnawed.
That was a train.
Statements that symbolize Dinkel's homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was such a place shaped by the railway..
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen mountain route to the north, which has its peak in Steinbach am Wald after an ascent of about 220 metres.
To cope with this, train and thrust locomotives, which had their homeland in Pressig, were needed in the past.
In 1901 the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprentice workshop, overhead line and railway master workshop.
"The heartpiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years of professional railway workers.
The Pressig railway depot, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight elloks were stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the 1939 route already minimized the need for train and thrust locomotives.
From 1977 on, they were only needed for freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10 000 weights were still placed each month.
In 1982, parts of the factory were demolished, and in 1991 the rest were demolished.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that one has not considered a better use of the site, also in terms of freight transport".
On Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous railway station festival in Pressig for the anniversary "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10 000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressig marshalling station was history.
"The shunters and hemmers did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any misconduct would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen led for the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with opening success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second lap of the Beijing tennis tournament, as they did before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French Kristina Mladenovic in the first round.
Next opponent of the world ranking third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kasachsten or the Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian who was number 13 gave up.
The Swabian is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach on the weekend as part of the series "Art and Pleasure".
With great ease registered organizers and visitors looked the ideal weather when the special opening "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the outdoor grounds of the estate Dahlmann-Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourist association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Art and pleasure".
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
The fascination of the exhibition was greatly appreciated by visitors.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be viewed in Mittelehrenbach, Germany.
Host Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening ceremony.
He's been here since the first hour.
Just like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
But Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer he put his task into proven, young hands with a good future perspective.
Both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists and have co-created flyers in the past.
This year again, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there is a 70 cent special stamp designed by them, available at any art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be acquired for eight euros.
Hahn rejoiced at the high popularity of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical framework..
When walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often decorated with colour accents.
Already at the entrance of the property awaits the visitor on the right hand side of the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightened in colour, playfully equipped with 20 windwheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bushwork in the background, the object seems magically sunk and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate herself in three-dimensional characters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts moving in the wind.
Siegrid Frey from Eckental displayed her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child" half way.
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy creation of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The topic "Windspiel-Performance" to stroll through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albanians also aired their displeasure.
At least five of them.
They did not want to accept partout with the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no sangesleben anymore in the district.
It has now become a legend: At a bench in the Tinnenbusch they raised the MGV 68 Albachten from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Meeting".
"It will be full today," assumed Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albanian singers.
They had revived the Foundation's celebration for the anniversary itself.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the festival was back.
An elegant ball it became, festive clothes had been asked before.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats in the "House of Encounters" as usual, but at tables.
In between, movement was required: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln attracted the controllers and asked for the dance floor.
It is a matter of honour that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten sounded the voice themselves.
Happy songs were announced in line with the occasion.
Almost set: "A day as beautiful as today".
Matching the exquisite grape juice that many had in store, there was the "Rüdesheimer wine".
In allusion to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" was performed, which is the Latin term for "hops".

"It's just fun to sing under his direction," said Holstiege, "He has such an easy manner, it's a feat he does." By the way, this time not only men presented themselves singing.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes Evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber sat at the desk until three in the morning to create his own rhyme.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented sounding poetry.
There was also a large tombola.
The proceeds will finance the children of the Albatros Youth Centre a visit to the Allwetterzoo.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The ascender marches.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring can be found in Liga 3.
No sign of shyness or freaking out, the independents are doing their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aase really good.
"That wasn't crystal clear, but we already left an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker agreed immediately: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not satisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the atmosphere was good, the game was ticked.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set the guests had a set ball.
"When they bring the goal to the goal, a game like this can tip," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its experienced forces and brought the full yield to the finish..
"We are all aware of who is on the other side of such a derby.
It doesn't break our necks.
I have seen really good volleyball in phases," Annacker did not argue with the 0:3 - and immediately moved to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the independent seems not foreseeable after just three days of play..
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The third league has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable with Regionalliga Volleyball". In the fourth league they don't want to look down anyway.
If the vest is not soiled in the next few weeks, they must look up.
A first balance can only be drawn after ten, eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee arrives in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
Heide Keller became a star on the dream ship.
Now she openly talks about the fact that the series could have had a co-indebtedness with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as Chief Hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "dreamship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018, she left the ship forever.
The series, which made her star, could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with which she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world alone with a suitcase and many of my admired colleagues noticed me at eye level," Keller tells in conversation with the "picture on Sunday".
At first she was always "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dreamship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it that much."
She considers it possible that her husband at that time might have been jealous, but "like many men, Hans also shunned talks about problems and emotions.".
Keller always tried to be the only one for Hans von Borsody "and he didn't want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I have disguised myself," she explains.
She had always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw me as an emancipated woman who I was never really, even though I sometimes seemed cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it might go wrong again."
The day before the civil wedding, I was in the dressing room crying and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why never worked with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had imagined love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I have approached love too naively".
The moth, who regularly explores the city's nightlife at the NZZ resort in Zurich, has ventured into the ZFF opening party this year.
Our moth is not a moth, but a little light shy.
And the glaring splendour in which a green carpet is immersed on the Sechseläutenplatz, blinds it over feeble.
But it's just film festival, more or less famous ones want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
On this late Thursday evening, he torses over the place to ease himself briefly in the "Aquaclean WC oasis".
This is the name of the public toilet system sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: The needy institution on the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
That evening, however, it stinks in the Lord's oasis for some reason to heaven.
So get out of here, over to the other side of the street: invited guests, who have just entertained the opening film "Green Book" at the best level in the cinema next door, celebrate like every year the festival start with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly to this film festival: The works shown from all over the world are known.
What do you not have to think of in an article about this festival, in order not to fall into disguise for its 190 partner companies.
The moth binds a volume around the feelers, which has given him a good fairy, and two bully doormen actually waved him generically.
Inside, the invited crowd, they dance far after midnight to live music or let DJ rhythms to which they yell at each other, and rinse down exquisite snacks with Cüpli.
In the delicacy store in the basement oysters are waiting for slurping mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain is gushing.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without big losses..
You have to love this country for it! It's a country!
The butterfly studies the shield at the escalator: "Take a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If that's two separate instructions, he's lost his dress code.
But it's rather a conditional construction, and it certainly has saved lives.
In the household goods department upstairs, the poultry man tilts a cocktail made with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily get the prize for the best beverage.
And George Clooney, who's been advertising for that badge for years, isn't here that night either.
But between local celebrities, cash desk and kitchen items, a face that is known to the observer passes by: Peter Farrelly, director of the opening film.
His lead actor shouldn't be far.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, with nearly sixty almost like a choir boy, walks through the crowd.
He's not being chatted, not beggared, you're just shooting.
International stars love this film festival especially for this restraint, often misunderstood as clutter.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dances
Coach and ex-football star Diego Maradona is happy about the win of the team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2–0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to cumbia rhythms, as shown in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in the yellow jersey, cheered by the players. I'm sorry.
The Mexican second division defeated the Leones Negros with 2:0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been working on the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: League 1: ASV Sending to Last-Minute-Pleite "destroyed to the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball club ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat". His protégés were "destroyed" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - broke - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly over long periods, the senders.
Only the initial phase "we have totally sleepy", the ASV trainer was angry.
The owners quickly led with 8:1, even the early break, which Bieletzki had taken, did not at first fruit.
"But then suddenly a jerk went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter hour.
The gap was only two goals for the break.
Especially Sending Best, Marius Hintze, met in the phase another time.
After the change it became even better from the visitor's perspective.
After 33 minutes David Ernst compared to 15:15, the relay changer led almost consistently.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly soothing three hits (29:26).
And then?
Put the impartials into action.
Bieletzki usually avoids the guilt of others.
But: The 120-second time penalty Steffen Mühlhoff collected was "a joke."
LIT had a good laugh and hit four times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood well in the back against seven men and threw again and again at the empty goal.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damned victory has to come," said Bieletzki.
ASV gates: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police digs for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (Landkreis Hof), the police are looking for the remains of the woman.
Forces dug up a road in Marxgrün on Saturday.
For this purpose, the pavement and several layers of it were removed, as police and prosecutors shared.
According to new evidence, missing persons may not have been buried far from their place of residence.
The woman has disappeared since November 4, 1986.
The investigators did not rule out a crime.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court and the prosecutor's office have been working intensively on the case again.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators encountered an abnormality under the road near Marxgrün using a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained in the smell of human bones, the officials narrowed the area to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers lie in the web.
However, users themselves can also provide additional safety.

Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his imminent dismissal as head of the billion dollar company.
He and the U.S. Exchange Supervision SEC filed an extrajudicial lawsuit over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay 20 million dollars each, and Musk also gives up the office of Chairman for three years, a position comparable to that of the German Supervisory Board.
He may remain Chief Executive Officer.
In the settlement, which still has to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager before the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who is also in charge of SpaceX, is the public face of the losing electric car pioneer, which is now valued at over $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is not aware of guilt
Musk explained that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the complaint.
He had always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter supporters that he might take the company off the stock exchange, paying 420 dollars per share, the financing being secured.
Tesla would have been valued at 72 billion dollars.
Later Musk rowed back: Tesla remains on the exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find an external chairman, hire two independent board members and set up a committee to monitor Musk's communication.

"Let's Dance"-Juror Joachim Llambi and wife Ilona separated
Joachim Llambi probably separated from his wife Ilona.
The dance expert has become known through the RTL show "Let's Dance".
After 13 years of marriage Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.
The "Bild am Sonntag" (Bezhal Inhalt) reports on the separation of the well-known moderator and dance expert, citing Llambis' lawyer.
"Our clients have separated by mutual agreement and friendship," the lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser said according to "BamS".

Polls: 46 percent don't want Merkel as Chancellor until 2021
The GroKo collects several poll low blows after the querels of the past weeks.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is critically viewed.
Berlin - The AfD overtook the SPD for the first time on Sunday in the Emnid Sunday trend.
In the weekly poll of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by a counter to 17 percent, the SPD scores one point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose one meter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union on Sunday.
Greens reach 15 per cent, leftists 11 and FDP 10 per cent.
If the Bundestag elections were held on Sunday, the ruling parties SPD, CDU and CSU would, according to Emnid, get only 43 percent of the votes.
The grand coalition has now lost the majority on the Sunday issue at all major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties reach 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag election, they received a combined 53.4 percent.
The other parties also have a wide range of options: the AfD, the second largest party in several polls, reaches 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach voting shares of 12.5 to 17%.
The left side is an average of 10 percent, while FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent upwards and downwards depending on the percentage of votes.
But the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also fallen significantly since the 2017 Bundestag election.
At present, only 48 percent of citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the Chancellery, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS revealed.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 percent) currently wants the grand coalition to hold the next regular Bundestag election in three years, 41 percent for a new election.
A further survey published on Saturday had also seen significant losses in popularity for Merkel.
The Germans also judge split whether Merkel should again run for the CDU presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, 44 percent against.
Thus, 64 percent of the Union's supporters want candidacy, 35 percent not.
Aushang at Aldi: Price reduced to happiness of love
Is Aldi becoming Tinder 2.0?
Who says in times of Tinder there are no more romantic acquaintance stories - he should talk about turkey meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket radiates almost an anachronistic romance as a place to meet the great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer short bargain at the Wühltisch or the favorite pudding is still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The app Tinder has a reputation for being less a contact, rather a slippery stock market.
We dared the test: How do women react, you don't talk about the hot bush for long in the first message?
Here's the amazing result.
Rule-right Hollywood-Lovestory-potential has it then, when the love luck precedes an out-of-the-eye-lost-and-retrace-plot precede.
If the guy also registers at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de with his loved ones, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at its best.
So it is the author of this advertisement in a Aldi branch unknown to us to wish that she will also find her dream man, with whom she briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic putty meat".
She definitely deserves her Happy End à la Hollywood to believe in the magic of analog getting to know.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgeri School has been involved in the action "Liddle against polio - 500 covers for a life without polio".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease called polio in German leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany, polio is considered to be eradicated, but there are three countries around the world where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can so far only be contained by vaccination, as a press release states.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand quiet for Götze
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB Sports Director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus called for an end to the public discussion on the form and fitness of Mario Götze.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And that doesn't do us any good," said Reus, friend of Götze, after the 4-2 victory in Leverkusen at the TV station Sky.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy position.

"But there will certainly be the moment where we sit and talk," Eberl said on Sunday night on TV station Sky.
Football: Bezirksliga: Researchers appearance of VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch went to court with his own.
Wortkarg, coach of VfL Wolbeck, retired (inside) to reflect on the lack of commitment on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, it's going around the Brandhoveweg.
Taufrischer Beleg is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past season only very thinly past the ascent.
Yeah, I'm very happy about the gig.
"We have narrowed the rooms and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and went to each individual for the game in order to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance against ambitious guests.
After 26 minutes, the coach had to change systems.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes in front waited for balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more play shares in the first section of the game.
And opportunities. - Yeah.
But Frerichs before his departure (17th), Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
Almost it would have been avenged when the SCA hit dangerously in front of the Wolbecker box twice in a minute of 41 by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his profession.
After the break the VfL took over the full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed.
Schroer also came too late for a Thewes entry after 58 minutes.
With the change of Miles Geske, Fetsch on the left side missed another fresh cell cure.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbäumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free kick in front of the guest housing for the placeholders.
The foult took part himself and demonstrated his dangerousness at standards.
Westhues" thing with the right flap hit down left from the shooter's perspective - 1:0 (71.).
Twenty minutes to get fucking long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew in the 80th minute the leather in the penalty room unfortunately to the hand.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the spot.
Jannis Schneider did not allow himself to miss the gift (79.).
Bange Minutes had to survive Wolbeck in the final phase, before Geske in the 87th minute from twelve meters still had the victory hit on the push.
Maybe too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehrberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

helicopter crashes in Kottingbrunn
The landing occurred at the airfield where the accident was still taking place.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
Around 2 p.m. on Sunday at the airport in Kottingbrunn a drama came.
At the landing of a helicopter turbulence occurred, as confirmed by the police towards oe24.
The heli was captured by a wind-boe, crashed on the ground and came to a standstill on the side.
Police, rescue and fire services were immediately notified.
With a large task force, the forces arrived at the disaster site.
The ÖAMTC emergency helicopter was also called for caution..
Inmates only slightly hurt.
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and could go home independently.
The exact circumstances of the accident are not yet clear and the investigation is under way.
According to the firefighter Franz Resperger, there was a small fire that could be quickly extinguished.
Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards
Only 8 percent of the board members were female on September 1st, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", which was officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and was available to the German Press Agency in advance.
"The companies will have to stand up differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them," said Foundation CEO Wiebke Ankersen.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, purely male-occupied management teams - with few exceptions - are far from conceivable.
The gap makes the German competitors in comparison less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It's another corporate culture.
Moreover, the slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchanges was due solely to positive impulses from companies in the medium-sized value index (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 per cent of the board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
At the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit consistent women again next year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signalled that they would not continue to make a commitment to increase the share of "zero percent" until now.
A different picture emerges from the supervisory boards: on 1 September the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"If there were just as many women recruited for the board of directors each year, a share of 40 percent would have been reached by 2023," says the report.
Some even make a mess: Luxury coach: Which manufacturer earns most per car?
Ferrari deserves the best.
The Italians take 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who makes the most profit per car among the noble suppliers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
"Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer dealt with this question.
His study indicates that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made an operating profit of 69,000 euros with every car sold in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 euros.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices of an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros earnings before interest and taxes.

Torch procession at the opening of the 60th Abtswind Wine Festival
The Tourist Association opened its Wine Festival session in Abtswind with a torchlight.
For the 60th time, the association organizes the wine festivals, which start every Saturday in October in the large marquee at Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the anniversary, under the sounds of the Spielmannszug from Wiesenbronn, the responsible people moved through the place to the Festplatz.
The chairman of the Tourist Association, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe, welcomed the guests in the already busy marquee. "60 years of doing something like this - this is an amazing achievement for a small village with 800 inhabitants.
One can be proud of that," Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine Princess Lisa II later symbolically attacked the guests from the stage.
"Nice that so many have found their way to Abtswind again." Later, "The Troglauer" provided the mood.
On Sunday, on which the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the association set the drinks prices on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon as 60 years ago.
A festive evening for the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, 5 October, in the guest's house, before going one day later in the marquee into the second round.

The 29-year-old doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could not help her.
Another called emergency doctor attempted this - but unsuccessfully.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close consultation with the Bonn prosecutor's office, are investigating who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we are uncomfortable
After the blaming break in the league cup, Manchester United is now losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, ManU is in 1:3. The way of defeat may still be to speak.
The 74th minute scene in which the regenerated Marko Arnautovic shot 3:1 for West Ham was symbolic; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all defenders of Manchester stopped, leaving Arnautovic all the time to shoot by the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative peak of a previously insufficient performance.
At present, the mood at United's city rival Manchester City is quite different.
The Citizens trained by Mourinho's big competitor Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Hove Albion for an approximate 2:0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the defense bar of the outsider for the home team.
Sergio Agüero took care of the sixth victory in the seventh game after a good hour and a double pass with the former goal scorer, and thus also for the jump to the top.
Liverpool no more table leader
Three days after the 1–2 defeat in the Liga Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri and Liverpool defeated Chelsea in the Premier League.
As in the Cup, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The 27-year-old's hit in the 25th minute remained the only match of the game until the final phase.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
After the Reds started the week with a flawless balance, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the Cup, with Remis in the League, the Blues Liverpool, now also falling off the top of the table.
Like City, London's Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) clubs celebrated 2:0 victories in the city.
The fans of the Gunners, in which Granit Xhaka played, however, had to wait until the 81st minute for a success report against the surprise team from Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart buxed Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later, Mesut Özil made the decision with his third season goal.
Arsenal moved past Watford thanks to the fifth consecutive victory and is now immediately behind the great rival Tottenham in 5th place.A strong impression continues to be made by Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten for the fifth time in a row at the 2–0 against Southampton and took 8th place.
VW core brand missing: Paris Motor Show on the theme of diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in exchange for the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic and yet omnipresent: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not let the German car companies go at the industry meeting in Paris.
From next week, they will be presenting their new products in the French capital together with competitors from across the world.
The diesel does not really play a major role in this.
The possible exchange and retrofitting offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, should nevertheless be an important topic, at least behind the brilliant scenes of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core VW brand.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and have, among other things, their first pure electric models: the Ingolstädter e-tron will be launched at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
But both were officially presented.
The iNext from BMW is to start in 2021.
The focus in Paris is the new 3 Series.
This year, more than 250 exhibitors will be present from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers and numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange for the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, more than a million visitors came.
In the severe earthquakes and the subsequent tsunami, at least 380 people died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island had been shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5,9, the second was the strength 7,4 and the second had the thickness 7,4. The first was the tremor.
Communication and transport connections are damaged, and there is enormous damage to property.
After the quakes the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach in the coastal town of Palu for a festival.
It is feared that the number of victims is still significantly higher.
The figures come from Palu.
However, many other municipalities are concerned - along Sulawesi's west coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final divine service for motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a helper team.
Werdohl - The place in front of the peace church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final divine service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westfalia and thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of the strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place on the last Sunday of a month at the House of North Hell.
Bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
On Sunday around 150 bikers had come together to do anything but ordinary worship.
Already from 10 o'clock the Bolids were lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
At first, the biker's early shoot was on the agenda and it could be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a hearty curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, also participated.
The sermon was held during the Biker service by Father Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the music accompaniment.
"Although bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill is more poetically calm," says Father Frank Schröder.
This was certainly a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big celebration: after the apple comes the milk..
Borisch was also active on the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated step by step the process from the ripe apple to the apple juice to his astonishing spectators.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and had the apples filled in the big funnel.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how this would turn into a tasty drink.
But they could also look at this important step this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in forms and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces looking a little bit like hickselgut layer by layer.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was not so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large container.
But the fugitive farmer also had ready-made specialities.
So he opened his treasure box and presented the latest feather white to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was accordingly large.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came into the conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built bouncy castle for themselves.
Also active of the fugitive comradeship of former soldiers engaged themselves during the festival and invited at some stations to entertaining plays.
The Heimatverein will continue to offer an action day next year.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp stressed, the home house in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the location of the event.
Instead, a farm is going to be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: after all, the milk will be around.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth season broke: "Fucky Situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed pros from Hannover 96 and gave them courage.
However, there was not much positive to see in the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out as a team," said 96-football pro Pirmin Schwegler and pushed after: "Of course, that's disappointing, because you always do a lot."
The further victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) met the connection, stand with two counters at the bottom and are in their current constitution a candidate for descent.
On the other hand, Frankfurt celebrated the first home win of the season, led by outstanding Ante Rebic.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored in front of 46,300 spectators the goals for the DFB Cup winner, who after the successful rehearsal for the European League match against Lazio Rome with seven points in the middle of the table.
Croatia's vice-champion of the world, Rebic, was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hesse in his debut debut and never managed by Hannover's defences.
With his speed and assertiveness, the striker, long after the World Cup, showed why he is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, loaned by Liverpool FC, was the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurter, which began with a swing.
Lucas Torró (17th)'s headball on the net of goals for the first time brought danger.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96-refuge around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term failed Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the landlords fell almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic raised the ball in the penalty room after a corner, Haller extended his head to the gate, where Ndicka only had to stop his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga match for AJ Auxerre's second division player in the summer.
And Frankfurt fell off before the break, too.
This time Haller fit his storm partner Rebic, who skilfully refueled and 96-doorkeeper Michael Esser didn't take a chance.
In the mid-term Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak idea of his eleven and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
Although the Niedersachsen played a bit more courageously forward, igniting ideas remained out until shortly before the end, when after all the connecting hit succeeded.
The Hesse were much more efficient.
After an hour Rebic started a solo and then laid across De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was for the Frankfurters against overburdened guests only show-runs, also Jovic met one minute before the end.
Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, there was a good mood at the Oktoberfest in downtown.
The mayor of Munich Dieter Reiter made it to millions at the opening of the 185.
Munich Wies'n last week with two beats.
Geisingen: Geisingen Christians celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross on September 14 or Sunday after.
The festive service takes place in the city church, then a procession to the Holy Cross church with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross houses the shot Christ, who came from the 30-year-old war and is said to have shot a Swedish soldier.
Then blood flowed out of the gunshot wound.
From this a large pilgrimage to the shot Christ developed, which then also led to the building of the Holy Cross Church.
This is still not finished, only the altar room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his homily, Father Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The divine service was poorly attended despite the importance for the Geisinger parish.
After the divine service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing the church part of the feast of the Cross ended.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has been inviting to the secular part of the festival in the Catholic parish home.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the town church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will continue until next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual tenders were prepared more specifically.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has increased, but more has also been found, which was only possible by the appearance by means of scaffolding.
The plastering of the base has been completed, before winter the natural stone works are to be started and one hopes to finish a good half of this work this year.
Inauguration: New dormitory in Neu-Ulm Münsterblickstraße
The Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new dorm for people with disabilities on Münsterblickstraße.
That in Münsterblickstraße "a very special house" is now handed over to its destination - all present agreed on the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have already been living in the residence of Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the unique architecture of the new building.
In his concept, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former US Army officer's building was put to the test for the residents with mobile phone cap: "The house had come into the years and was no longer up-to-date in the equipment," Bader explained retrospectively.
The excavators moved in 2016 to tear down the house.
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible, so that the residents can feel comfortable in the building, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new residence
Life support invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450000 euros.
The construction works have remained within the planned framework, according to architect Bader - both in time and financially.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and fireproof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had set up a home with the many specifications, which allows the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move without foreign help.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, also said: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its inhabitants who need tools to be able to be mobile".
The homeliness and functionality had been well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The property in this position is a real stroke of luck because it can no longer be acquired in the present situation".
In total, the new dormitory in Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities on almost 1500 square metres, divided into three residential groups.
Lebenshilfe managing director Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed according to tariff.
Germany: Schwesig complains about differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the Day of Unity, deputy SPD chairman Manuela Schwesig called on all compatriots not to accept the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unit.
We must not be content with these differences," said the Minister-President of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the "Tagespiegel am Sonntag".
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It was unacceptable that East Germans worked on average longer than the people in West Germany, but would receive 15 percent less salary than the others.
"I can't explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this cute dog end the conflict between Korea and North Korea?
The year-old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has gifted South Korean President Moon Jae in two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two dogs, about a year old, reached their receiver already Thursday.
They passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to make it easier for the animals to "acquaint".
The dogs with thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North announced its friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in mid-September in Pyongyang.
Both countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to apply together for the Olympic Games in 2032, which will take place in the year 2020.
Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket engines as part of the mutual approach.
Austria's moving history mirrored by 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this year of remembrance, numerous new books have appeared, which usually answer this question in retrospect of the past one hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and general director of the Austrian State Archives, puts it quite differently in the magnificent "picture book" Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New week, new opportunity for the government.
Back to the actual work - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the grand coalition starting today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU finally did not conjure up the "return to substantive work" mantra-like.
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and material work, but be so.
If the Federal Government is now ready to devote itself again to its mission - governance - it should not be prevented now with conceptual debates.
Whether Union and SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and embarrassments of the last few weeks, will probably show Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties meet in the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to call this round regularly in order to defuse conflicts early on; a lesson from all this dispute.
First of all, however, there are again conflicting issues on the agenda with the diesel retrofits and the Skilled Workers' Migration Act.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get away with exchange awards, while SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to retrofit older diesel.
While a rapprochement has emerged over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the Union and SPD are still far apart in the planned labour immigration law.
The SPD calls for a stay perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or make training.
The Union is strongly opposed to the "change of track" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be another dispute between the coalition partners - and how else should it be?
Not equal and equal has joined forces to form the GroKo, but three partners with sometimes very different social images and priorities.
Fight is good.
Without a dispute, a society marked by such diverse and sometimes contradictory interests does not advance.
In order to be constructive, however, there must be no uplifting of the issue of being or not being for party tactical reasons.
It's still politics, not theatre.
Union and SPD should argue - but always have the reality of life in mind.
What is feasible and benefits to many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the lane change question can be pragmatically clarified - and thus regain confidence.
Above all, that is why the People's Party must now fight for it.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in focus
Does the Minister of Labour, of all people, violate the applicable right of service?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
"Really day and night" their legists had worked on the social security reform, reported an exuberant social minister at the presentation two weeks ago.
Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger's statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is astonished - it brings the matter to Parliament via question.
She assumes that "the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the deployment of her team and not to announce violations of the applicable service law in front of cameras running".
Nevertheless, she now has questions in order to be able to "deprive of any suspicion".
Police rips a street in search of women's corpses on the road
Marxgrün - Long the police did not want to comment.
Now there's confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been dug.
The route is closed in the area of Marxgrün until Monday, however.
It was preceded by the investigators having previously used an archeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was able, together with his guide, to limit the relevant spot to a few meters.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian conservation authority in the area of the said street.
For more than a year, prosecutor's office and criminal court have been handling the missing person's case.
Again and again a cycle path was closed at Marxgrün and investigated with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that Heike's body could have been buried here in the course of the construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: Riots in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia is the first anniversary.
But there's a lot of riots going on.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation in autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Just before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and police have occurred in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the supporters of independence with paint powder, among other things, as they were trying to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3,000 police officers from the police units Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues at a rally that last year was used in the polling stations as illegal.
At the time, violence had also occurred in trying to prevent citizens from voting in the Chamber.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep apart the demonstrations of the separatists and the central security forces, Spanish media reported.
However, some of the approximately 6,000 separatists would have tried to break the police chain by force, and the officials would have thrown paint bags and eggs, among other things.
Six people had been arrested, 24 others had been slightly injured, according to the authorities.
On Monday, the independence referendum will be the first anniversary.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to split the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under compulsory administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont escaped into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also set out abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, however, continue to be under arrest.
New elections had been held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government came to office in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But the new Regional President Quim Torra also insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalia: Agreed perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split up goallessly
Red-and-white Ahlen continues to step on the spot.
Also with FC Gütersloh it reached only a 0:0 draw.
In front of 438 spectators in Heidewaldstadion, the final light and the third one turned out to be a total perplexity.
The first half was very manageable from the entertainment factor.
Those who preferred to get a beer or a bratwurst could do this without worry.
There was no risk of missing a goal, because there were practically none.
First shot after half an hour
Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot for the whole game in the 28th minute.
The Ahlener had the best - and in principle only real - opportunity when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling to parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty line.
The hosts were even more innocent.
Its most effective action was an early change.
Stormer Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, the two teams decided to do something about the growing boredom of the game, and the team decided to take action.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Müttel from 18 meters aimed just above the housing and after one hour also the Gütersloher appeared for the first time offensive.
After a shooting of Matthäus Wieckowicz, things went smoothly.
Nick Flock (62.) "crowned" the quickly performed counter over Sinan Aygün with a lax shot in the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also put on a Wieckowicz headball (66th) after a corner ball by former figure Tim Manstein.
RWA interim trainer Angelo Daut responded, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Müppel (70.).
It didn't do anything. It did nothing.
The Ahlener did not achieve more than visual superiority thanks to their own initiative.
Only in the 91st minute did Cihan Yilmaz have the last chance, but she also didn't get anything.
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positive: "I like that we played to zero". But unfortunately the zero also stood in front.
"This time we weren't as dangerous as we were against Holzwickede and even though our opponent didn't want to play along," said RW Ahlens Interim Coach.
Offensively, "everything was a bit flaunting" against a team that just wanted to defend.
At least I didn't feel like we could get a countergate," Daut says.
To his sorrow, however, one did not feel as if his team could score a goal, either.
The performance was too poor.
Reckenfelder Harvest Thanksgiving Market: Fortunately there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle, for which these donations are intended.
The volunteers insure: "These donations remain in Reckenfeld as well".
At the opening, the sky turned bright blue, but the place was still a little empty, but that should change during the day.
Because: "It's so pleasant here, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a proper pinch of humor.
For the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be balanced against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreomer jumped in at short notice.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" did not allow itself to entertain musically the increasing visitors.
This was so good that later on a few folk songs were sung along.
"Just great," said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer could accommodate the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is happy about the many active people with their stands, among them mostly clubs.
"Actually, there should be no such thing as a table," he thanked for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of all who were in action at the stands and also included the other festivals and the "Clean up" campaign that took place in September.
Our garden city gives itself a colorful painting - here something goes.
Then the Maikranz was taken away by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and taken to Winterquartier.
Many stalls were worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty everything was available.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative at his decupier saw.
He had veneer works, beer lids with Reckenfeld motifs and more on offer.
A speciality was offered by three Reckenfeld beekeepers: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought along by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has another specialty.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
The little Elsa had to access again and again, so good the cake tasted.
It is the sociability that allowed the visitors to linger long until the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubricating with local political message: No successful advertising for skaters
In Lengerich, unknown people have advertised in a way that is hardly conducive to the construction of a skater's park, probably in an unfavorable manner.
In several places there are corresponding briberies, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration on request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have been sued for property damage.
In large letters the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" were written on signs at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that a corresponding lettering on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt bistro had already been discovered after the trade fair on 19 September.
Since the short message had apparently been left "only" with an edding, it could easily be removed.
"A few days later, however, this was there again, this time sprayed," says Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
This particular case receives a special note by the fact that on the board several large companies from Leingerich are also called.
If the skate system is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already commitments, Jörg Hesselmann from the city's school, sport and culture department, without mentioning any names, explains.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical with those companies on the smeared board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the subject of skating facilities.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
The Council finally voted in favour of the majority of the fire station.
However, this idea has not been implemented - too many factors seem to have spoken against a building at this point.
At the end of June a turnaround followed.
The members of the Main and Financial Committee voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word is then given to the city council.
It is based on a decision this year, so that a positive vote could be made in 2019.
Air traffic control bottleneck is getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in summer, the German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement next year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes," said Matthias Maas, head of the air traffic control union, the German press agency, before the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
One important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures was the long-known shortage of personnel in European air traffic control services, for which there was no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist, who said.
The market for ready-to-use pilots across Europe was swept away.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone, around a hundred people were missing to monitor upper German airspace.
Maas again criticized the fact that various aviation unions were not invited to the summit.
On Friday, representatives of the federal, state, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet in Hanseatic City to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work densification and overtime, it won't work without us," explained the head of the GdF, who has many members at the German air traffic control company.
Maas again made guidelines of the EU Commission responsible for the pilot miseries.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings at national air traffic control services are now fully operational.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "do not cut off the air any further".
At present, EU targets would be agreed by 2024 and further tightening would be feared.
The EU is constantly under lobby pressure from airlines.
"Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He hoped that the high delay costs for airlines would lead to a rethink.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Traffic Control (DFS) offers a "consistent training and future pact", said Maas.
The so far announced admission of 120 pilot pupils per year over the next five years is just enough to offset the age-related departures.
The necessary staff building is not yet involved.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board approves corporate restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously for the plans to rebuild the company.
According to Thyssenkrupp interim CEO Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed CEO at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis-ridden group will be split into two separate companies.
Both companies are said to be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should not be an additional reduction in staff beyond the already known reductions in administration.
After two resignations, the control body on the capital side counts only eight heads.
There are ten representatives of the employees.
The final decision, however, is expected to be taken by a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include, among other things, the 50 percent share in the combined steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be bundled with elevators and subcontracting.
Barcelona: Violence in demonstrations of policemen and Catalan supporters of independence.
Two simultaneous demonstrations of Spanish policemen and Catalan supporters of independence in Barcelona have resulted in violent clashes with numerous injured.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 police from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6000 supporters of independence demonstrated.
The Catalan police had tried to keep the two protest trains away from each other with a large task force.
However, according to the forces, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
You would have attacked the officers with paint and gunshots.
According to the reports, there were also rangels between the participants of the various protests.
According to rescue services, 24 people were injured.
The police said there were six arrests.
Better wages and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police had wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who had taken action almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum banned by the Spanish central government in Catalonia.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they deserve.
The demonstrators perceived it as a provocation that the Spanish police demonstrated in Barcelona of all places.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez of AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they hit us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to name Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades, who have only done their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more echo.
But he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke," the policeman assured.

Football: Juve-Trainer praises after top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker had "played the best game this evening along with the half hour of Valencia", praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record winner against SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensively purchased star was the decisive man in the important game against the pursuer without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and it's good," Allegri said, "and I'm sorry.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we have grown.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goal templates, Juve shot the game by hitting Dries Mertens (10th minute) after the early delay and depended on the worst chaser for the time being.
The goal hunter, who was picked up by Real Madrid, first put on former Bundesliga pro Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double pack (26./49.).
And Ronaldo also did the preliminary work on the match for the head of defense Leonardo Bonucci (76th) after a corner by headball, who just had to push in before the goal line.
"He gives a lot of templates," praised the coach.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goal scorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We need to be even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
Best Juve goal shooter is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in the account.
With Ronaldo's purchase for more than 100 million euros, Juventus' superiority seems to be more overwhelming.
Seven victories in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. At 21 points, the champion of the past seven years already has six points ahead of Naples.

But at the latest after the rejection of the already warned Mario Rui (58.) the top part was determined..
The Portuguese had to climb too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red from the square.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also able to feel addressed.
The German national player has won over Juve.
==References====External links==*BDFutbol profile*Futbolme profile
The midfielder also played in the Champions League game against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown off the course for the 2-0 victory of the Turins and is closed for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes its name
With a particularly bizarre performance, Rapper Kanye West paid attention to the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused frowns and question marks among viewers.
He also announced a name change on time for the release of his new album.
From now on, you can only call him "ye", according to the musician.
"The being that was formerly known as Kanye West" he tweeted following the late singer Prince when he took his stage name.
The pseudonym is not news, however.
Already the tenth album appeared under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist explained that "ye" had a religious significance for him.
"I think "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "you," says the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
We did it!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage did not hide his disappointment.
This was a weak game of ours today.
The opponent was simply more grippy, we have hardly ever put him before problems". Accordingly thin reads the list of Hoetmar shooting possibilities.
Gradually two goals in 90 minutes, so games can rarely be made positive.
Football League A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two possibilities in the first run, but the first used Maik Krause from a sharp angle towards the early lead (7th).
In the 43rd minute Steffen could have increased Uphus, but after a great preliminary work by Krause he deluded free standing.
The hosts had only a double opportunity when first Moritz Höne failed at Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and found his master in the second shot of Jan Blome in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61.) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all forgiven.
A commercial meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved his hand on the gate line and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann could not also use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide poked the ball over the line was the game decided (81.).
"We had criticized each other hard before, which was different today than in the last weeks," said Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Gates: 0:1 Krause (7th), 0:2 Berheide (81st).

Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacle football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia 3:4
"I don't even know what to think about it," he ran for words.
"We didn't get access to them at all." He probably meant the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green-whites who had a collective offensive.
Nevertheless, he could laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, winking cheekily and pulling from then on His players, on the other hand, was the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Remember, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for class preservation.
With understandable mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski glanced back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was by far our best season performance," he says.
"As we come back after the 0-2, as we keep against it over the entire playing time against one of the top teams in the league, that was really phenomenal."
It seems all the more bitter that one must now go home empty-handed.
Top goaltender Lars Zymner brought the hosts into the lead with his 12th season goal (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game to score this goal.
He placed the 2:0 over the left side exemplary for Fabian Fröhning.
We knew that, but you can't take a player like that completely.
"That was already insanity what he did," Lewandowski recognized the quality of the opponent enviously.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own elf made the balance: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia gatekeeper Hinkerohe into the long gate (45.).
After the side change, it was again McGill who scored the balance (59.)
Then it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64.), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann compared (69.).
In spite of the high number, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit (80th).
We need to focus on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten is what we now have to win," Lewandowski told us.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbucker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87st Bareksai).
Gates: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Fröhning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2) McGill (59.2), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74th/Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg wins point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga duel between TSV Straßberg and FV Biberach.

Media: Entire Presidium of Dynamo Dresden resigned
The entire presidium of football second division Dynamo Dresden has resigned according to media reports.

Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
Good thing he's gone.
There are only a few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as great relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
For three days, the Turkish president was a guest in Berlin and Cologne, and many had thought that he should not have been invited.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Celebrities and new offers
The Evangelische Akademie Tutzing offers about 80 conferences until mid-next year.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has signalled that he wants to personally pick up the tolerance price in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was there as a guest there.
Thus, Academy Director Udo Hahn reckoned him when he said proudly: "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors were already with us." However, the fact that celebrities always appear at the Academy in Tutzing Castle was also a topic at the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker takes part in a conference on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective.On 29 September, the writer Frido Mann attends a conference about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also agreed: he wants to personally receive the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television host Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 conferences will be held by mid-2019.
"The pension is not safe!" is in a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the academy describes the "risky and deadly route via the Mediterranean Sea".
"And to a meeting on Syria: "Barbarism without limit".
Weapons deals, destruction, torture, death - war mocks every humane idea."
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to the radical change of work through digitalization.
Academy Director Hahn was convinced: "Free democracy needs places where civil society can come together to seek solutions or at least partial solutions."
At a conference on the 200th century.
Karl Marx's birthday soon awaits one more visitor of the direction of capitalism criticism, the other rather a tendency "from left to center".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Church," said study director Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100% neutral."
Music Cabaret: Gender Understanding with Heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Both suitable for adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret artist, Teubner preoccupied himself with gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth of heart for the (feeled) woman and the (felt) man and what else there may be but also with music.
The mini-guitar put her in and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp was sitting on the wing.
On the one hand, this is the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes to the end of the movement to speak, on the other hand, a true pianist: So congenially harmoniously accompanies Süverkrüp Teubner that some might have wished for a solo.
That was also true, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, as it fit the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had brought into play a paradox: the satisfaction of the man comes if he has a partner but does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not bring any benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates this: What would have emerged from Mozart's composition if "the Nannerl" had unexpectedly opened the door?
So Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt full of blood and wounds" to the "Lied vom Tod", and from Mozart's G minor symphony into a playful dance.
There was big applause and "Bravo" from the full room..
Flowers presented Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, the Chansonette.
But the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not take any additional thanks.
She had the idea of giving the duo performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt as well as one in Wolbeck.

Handball: Women's Landesliga: Ahlener SG keeps the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlener dames had problems especially with third-liga player Carolin Stallmann, who marked ten hits alone.
"Actually, I was satisfied with the defense, only one player made too many goals.
We didn't get to grips with them," says ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he became more upset about the many missed opportunities.
The focus at the end made his crew miss this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost until the end behind a delay, at the break with 11:12 and later with 15:18 (45.) behind.
Only towards the end did the broader bank of the hostesses make a decisive impact.
In addition, Aydogdu put Merle Klement on the left, which then made "extremely clever the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzer.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball women of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the leading group of the 3rd League West.
The Blue-Whites won 3:1 in the second division VC Allbau Essen.
"That was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the top third of the league.
We have now worked this out," said coach Dominik Münch, happy after an almost impeccable performance of his team at the downfall of the table leader.
The guests dominated the first passage almost at will.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went at 25:15 to the vice champion of the previous year.
Food accepted in the two-way bar, but did not come into play.
We've been busy.
Our opponent has opened with high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence the BSV already led with 12:8. "Essen changed the assumption to three bars.
We couldn't hold the impact pressure.
Food sucked up, and we got a bit lulled in," Münch continued.
At the 18:17 the volleyball women from the Ruhr area had their noses in front for the first time.
Although Ostbevern defended four sets of balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt, however, found its goal..
"The game was now a better class," said the instructor to the increasing level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the BSV turning the sheet from 14:16 to 25:21 in the third section of the paper.
Münch: "We played consistently and quietly".
About 7:3 and 15:13 brought the blue and white passage four by 25:22 to their side.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but also Maren Flachmeier had a fine day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dirtmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way in which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
"In the German-Turkish relationship, the mosque opening in Cologne left behind a heap of pieces that can only be difficult to meet," said Gökay Sofuoglu, Chairman of the TGD, the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and German sides would have missed the chance for a joint, conciliatory performance.
"Instead of working side by side with top German politicians to underline the Muslims' belonging to Germany, Erdogan has used the appointment for his purposes," Sofuoglu complained.
The extensive exclusion of the German public had "strengthened many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already established itself
After the long summer break it's finally Folktreff time again!
On October 18th (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the Heimatverein Nottuln already organizes its fifth Nottulen Folktreff in the fireplace room of Alte Amtmannei.
Almost on the day exactly it is then a year ago that we performed a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottilner Heimatverein.
I didn't think that our folk meet would be in Nottuln so quickly.
No matter if Sturmtief Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of Amtmannei was always full.
"As always, the program at the next Folktreff is a colourful mixture of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who invites friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer promised with his accordion for the first Folktreff "birthday".
He was a member of "Gaitling", a group from Steinfurt, who played music with flat German lyrics for many years.
Now he's with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folktreff remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz from the Volkstreff Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frogs in the Night" enthusiastically sent the listeners home with an earworm.
"We expect many happy guests to spend a social and humorous evening again," says the invitation of the home club.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to participate actively is invited.
Since the coveted seats are always fast, it is recommended to be there early enough.
The Folktreff starts at 7.30 p.m., but entry is already at 7 pm.
China approves proposed merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding questions must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step forward on their way to the world's largest industrial gas company.
The Chinese competition authority approved the proposed merger, said Linde on Sunday.
This means that the billion-dollar merger is still subject to permits in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the USA.
Most recently, the chances of an insider's approval had improved because Linde agreed to sell additional company parts.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
The 125th anniversary of the district association for horticulture and state care was celebrated with a gala in the Dr. Stammberger Hall.
On 29 September 1893, with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last founding impulses for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach were set, and exactly 125 years later, he celebrated a big jubilee on Saturday evening at the Kummbacher Stadthalle.
Of course, he was called "Kulmbach City and Land District Fruit Building Association" by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893, but in 1892 he was raised from the ground.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association also differed from today's work - it was actually a matter of fruit-making, no one thought about flowers and horticulture back then.
"At that time, in the Enlightenment era, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said district governor Günter Dippold in his festive lecture.
Fruit trees were to line the highways, so-called industrial gardens were built at schools.
The 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members, are still responsible for fruit growing.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an equally important role as the transfer of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwürfe" showed how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are on stage entertaining.
"The youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said district chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed how important nature experiences are for life.
The collection of chestnuts was a big thing for us children, I doubt that one can collect similar joy with smartphone & co..
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with landlord Klaus Peter Söllner to celebrate the anniversary.
"Where they should stand, the district association decides", added Landrat Söllner and emphasized the special significance of horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district left no doubt about it also district manager and expert consultant Friedhelm Haun..
He guided the many visitors through the long history of the district association with a picture lecture and reported among other things on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
Everything used to come out of the garden, it was plugged into the garden for wintertime.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the garden turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has survived, it was already there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it," the expert on fruit and nut trees pleaded.
Therefore, there is an incentive for the horticultural associations not to slacken, so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
This also included welcoming the new citizens to our associations, added Wolfram Vaitl, President of the Bavarian Federation.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the towerwinds of the Thurnau Music Association.

Priority to Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister moves UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: they provide both trading partners with an ultimate solution.
Canada's foreign minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement - and postpones her address to the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure in the struggle for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the USA and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister would not speak until Monday before the United Nations General Assembly, her spokesman, Adam Austen, said.
In the meantime, she focused on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the US would have 48 hours to agree if Canada really wanted to join the trade agreement already concluded between its country and the USA.
The US and Mexico agreed in August on a new version of the regional free trade agreement Nafta.
US President Donald Trump pointed out that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
The talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they will be brought to a conclusion, Trump's government wants to present the agreement to the US Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's President-designate Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral deal with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro was injured in a stabbing attack.
According to a report by the daily newspaper "O Globo", the extreme right ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country last week before the presidential elections.
The politician was attacked on the open road during an election campaign in South Brazil in early September.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht") women's associations had called for protests against the former military.
Also in the social networks, the associations mobilized racist and misogynistic statements against Bolsonaros.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia the protests mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and was therefore not allowed to run for office for the presidency.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As ex-mayor of the city of São Paulo Haddad was far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
Although the "Trump Brazils" has been involved in politics for a long time, it has recently become an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reaches the absolute majority in the first election round, there will be a final election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from this success - no matter who he fights.
Bolsonaro is known to be inciting homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He repeatedly shocked with verbal derailments.
Another time, he said that the supporters of Lula's left-wing workers party should be shot.

After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen told Larsen on his website.
Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children on his deathbed.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become familiar with the band Gasolin', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music stars like Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978 Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million plates in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is the most sold album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen on Sunday in a declaration as "street boy" who "was against everything but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had performed on the 70th birthday of Queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rock Night in the shoe factory: Volume at compressed air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger". The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a description of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: Hardrock pure from three other friendly bands.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert the musicians even take time for a group photo.
No sign of stage fright.

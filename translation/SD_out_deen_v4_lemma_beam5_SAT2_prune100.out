DFB CEO Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil to return to the national team.
"This is a question that of course depends on one getting into the conversation, that one also talks to him about why he apparently felt one or the other as it is stated in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasic mower" of the "Image-Newspaper".
Despite the month-long debate over Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of 92-time national player Özeil.
"I would have been pleased if Mesut Özil had continued playing for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would be so," said Grindel.
De 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified him by the fact that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to put up any pressure, but he knows it from football so that when "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a pity that this conversation has not yet come about".
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burnt
At 2.13 p.m., the professional fire brigade Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a power line leads directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, there was a risk in delay.
The fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire when it arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically in its entirety and fire debris removed to the absolutely necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden cabin, he had a battery to charge for lunch.
That might be the cause of fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the range of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire must still be determined - as must the cause of the fire.
However, it should be considerable, for the owner had many collectors' items in his garden hut.

What drove Lindsay Lohan to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.

The clip shows how Lohan gets out of a car and goes to a possibly homeless family that she wants as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees the actress, Lohan pursues her parents and children.
She accuses adults of doing child trafficking.
She doesn't give any evidence for all this in the clip.
"The whole world is watching this right now," Lohan says in the video, as she continues to follow the family along the street.
Apparently, she tries to separate the children from her parents.
Eventually, however, it seems that the obviously angry mother is enough.
Looks like she's turning around and slapping Lohan.
In tears, the actress affirms how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What prompted Lohan to do so is currently completely unclear.

DFB CEO Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil to return to the national team.
"This is a question that of course depends on one getting into the conversation, that one also talks to him about why he apparently felt one or the other as it is stated in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasic mower" of the "Image-Newspaper".
Despite the month-long debate over Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of 92-time national player Özeil.
"I would have been pleased if Mesut Özil had continued playing for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would be so," said Grindel.
De 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified him by the fact that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to put up any pressure, but he knows it from football so that when "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a pity that this conversation has not yet come about".
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burnt
At 2.13 p.m., the professional fire brigade Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a power line leads directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, there was a risk in delay.
The fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire when it arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically in its entirety and fire debris removed to the absolutely necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden cabin, he had a battery to charge for lunch.
That might be the cause of fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the range of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire must still be determined - as must the cause of the fire.
However, it should be considerable, for the owner had many collectors' items in his garden hut.
Angry mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open street
What drove Lindsay Lohan to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has streamed live herself as she apparently wants to snatch children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and releases a partial recording of the stream.
Here you can see "Good luck kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows how Lohan gets out of a car and goes to a possibly homeless family that she wants as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees the actress, Lohan pursues her parents and children.
She accuses adults of doing child trafficking.
She doesn't give any evidence for all this in the clip.
"The whole world is watching this right now," Lohan says in the video, as she continues to follow the family along the street.
Apparently, she tries to separate the children from her parents.
Eventually, however, it seems that the obviously angry mother is enough.
Looks like she's turning around and slapping Lohan.
In tears, the actress affirms how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What prompted Lohan to do so is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is said to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to earth.
The lander Mascot will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: Number of deaths on Sulawesi increases to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there are at least 420 deaths.
The number of victims could rise further.
The rescue teams have not yet entered the devastated areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Supervisory Board Chief
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused unrest in the stock markets at the beginning of August when he announced a withdrawal of the Eletroautomaker.
The U.S. Stock Exchange Inspectorate sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Teslas chief withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he is allowed to remain CEO.
Party Congress of British Conservatives
Sharply guarded - the Tories Congress
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party congress is about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the forefront of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been quarrelling over these names for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and the population will vote on this Sunday - whether it is going well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") is Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in Brazil is divided.
Thousands went to the streets in several cities to protest Jair Bolsonaro, the right-wing populist.
The "Trump Brazil" acts as an anti-system candidate and is thus in the lead in the surveys.
His sharpest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Labor Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" finishing takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force still exists," said Peter Mertens, Chief Development Officer, to the industry journal "Automobile Week".
In December 2017, Audi CEO Rupert Stadler, who was imprisoned and on leave, announced that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"All engine/gear combinations are expected to be tested in the first quarter of 2018, he said.
Mertens said: "At the beginning of July we reached an important milestone in the process of addressing the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi parent Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made "serious organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board had adjourned a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and wants to discuss it further this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi chief of having authorised the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust gas values after they become aware of the fraud.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
At present, the company is headed by the sales director Bram Schot as acting CEO.
Due to the switch to the new exhaust gas and consumption test standard WLTP, there were production failures at Audi, said Schot the "Heilbronner Voice".
In principle, he sees a declining demand for saloons such as Audi A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel strives for re-election - Lahm should join the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run again for office as DFB President in the coming year, despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel as a guest at ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" early Sunday morning.
You have to keep trying to re-election, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
The head of the association would find it "notable" in his own words if he did not "want to work on the future project" after the match for the 2024 European Championship.
Grindel has been the head of the association since April 2016 as the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, who fell over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place at the German Federal Day on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM chief organizer Philipp Lahm will work in the DFB Bureau.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would continue to advise the Bureau in this role and then, of course, be warmly invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," said Grindel, who said: "I am very pleased that my colleagues on the Bureau agree that he will continue to be consulted in the Committee Bureau.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB boss.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future he would become a national player without a migration background.
Currently, this office is held by the Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon.
"If one without a migrant background is clearly involved in society and football and says, "the issue is important, we have to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local associations where integration must work," said Grindel.
Properly reduce with half-wise scale
I've been holding a new toy for four weeks.
A balance that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat content.
It can also show muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it's more for the sausage.
Don't tell him if I replaced fat with muscle.
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear opening successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started with a clear victory in the new season of the Bundesliga.
Against Science City Jena, the vice-champion easily won 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing match over 40 minutes.
New addition Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliner with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counter) signed from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators at his mandatory game debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won the mandatory game debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at see Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 counters.

The new gamemaker Will Cummings dominated the Oldenburgers with 25 points.
The Braunschweigers, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the Baskets quickly ensured clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement who are living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens wherever they live.
We will not allow the PKK or Gülen Movement sympathizers to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship," he said..
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the Cologne city centre was partially closed.
Several thousand police were in action - including snipers.
The Islam Association Ditib is in criticism because it is regarded as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and Schrecksekunde
Musicians like Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have promoted more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert at Central Park in New York.
"Commit wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night in front of around 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B performed in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I sweat, but it's okay, because I am here ready to change the world.
Actors like Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and relief organizations also showed up at the multi-hour spectacle on stage.
In between, however, there was a scare second when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was gunshot, scared and tried to escape.
In short, panic arose, people ran into confusion.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed people down from the stage.
"No one is trying to hurt anyone," Martin said, "but I'm not hurting anyone."
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Those who wanted to get one had to read and spread texts, photos and videos on the global fight against poverty and diseases on the Internet.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applause from the audience - shouts for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He spoke together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake spoke out for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court in the US Senate's Judiciary Committee, and thus pushed many women against their heads.
At least three women have filed abuse charges against Kavanaugh up to attempted rape, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the charges after two women, who claimed to have experienced sexual assaults themselves, confronted him on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also meet me at any time in an elevator," Flake said at the New York concert to the crowd.
Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends dismissal of journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the dismissal of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the chancellor's office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had overlaid a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had entered the front row.
The T-shirt, was not the problem, said Seibert the image on Sunday.
It was about interrupting the press conference.
The journalist's action caused a great deal of unrest, which was unacceptable.
He had arranged for personal guards to take the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns during press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely regardless of whether or not it is a legitimate concern.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are threatened with several decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are not sure about the Turkish authorities either: Only in early September was Austrian journalist Max Zirngast arrested.
Most recently, the cases of detained journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
Although they came free and could return to Germany, there are still trials in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him as fresh and handsome: Florian David Fitz.
You'll have to look at it twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for its lively conversations at the bar of the Hamburg harbour bar "Schellfishposten".
Moderator Ina Müller meets with her guests some beer, some wine or even higher-percent drinks to loosen the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also drink courage for the obligatory vocal performances.
On Friday another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time the actor Florian David Fitz is known from movies like "Männerherzen", "Terror - Ihr Bewertung" or "Der gelsten Tag".
But the trip to the far north did not get well for the Munich.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely snuffed on it, his eyes only two small slits left.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick. He's just got a big cat.
Addressed to his fans, he posted some - probably not very serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER goes to Inas night.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And spray.
And the round of egg liqueurs that Ina throws at half past half past three, leave it.
Alcohol consumption is truly written on the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips to fight the afterlife.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - probably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
It is not known how Ina Müller survived the nightly bouncing.
Since she moderates the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more proven...
To a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa struggles with vandalism and misconduct
The entry into the 36-kilometre-long railway cycle path in Red Riding Hoodland in Treysa is difficult to find and waste.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are searched for, but solutions are hardly apparent.
Shards, cigarette dumps, garbage and debris, demolished trash cans and now dismantled signposts - this is how the entrance with seating group to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for some time.
For the flagship railway bike trail in Red Riding Hoodland a more than unfamous sight.
The topic has been occupied by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, according to the bicycle traffic officer of the city Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been addressed in the cycling advisory board.
There is no solution yet.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the entrance.
"I think the latter would be the imperative of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic was also included in the local council.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place to celebrate on weekends.
Not only is it often loud, but it also destroys the layers: the posts are torn out of the ground, the trash can is demolished, the signs are folded, the seats are smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are angry that the resting place on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for drinking.
"The focus here is clearly on the Haaße hill along the entire cycle path," confirms the bicycle traffic officer, who is now also worried about the new bike park in Ziegenhain, which is opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "Possibly this sets the threshold significantly higher to attack common property.
However, this would presuppose that a police patrol will pass in time.
In principle, Wüstenhagen desires a development of the Haaße hill.
He needed to be made more attractive.
One could be very pleased with the frequenting of the cycle path so far.
Tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high quality compared to others in Germany," says the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger, ADFC member Susanne Klippert assesses the situation in Asheroder Straße in Treysa.
There's no turning trail on the Haße hill.
In case of heavy traffic, cyclists can have to wait in the middle of the road between the two-way traffic flows," she explains.
This is no problem for sporty drivers, but for older people and especially for children.
Music Contest in the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call for a music contest was a success, creative and together.
"D ein Lied für Hiltrup", is the appeal of the district offensive Hilstrup, in the "Music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family affair with coffee and cakes from the volunteers of the cultural station.
Seven groups took place, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long Albanian living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We haven't experienced this in other parts of the city.
What did the copywriters see connected to?
At the places the Hiltruper lake and the Marktallee found particularly frequent mention.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his hit song.
The Kulturbahnhof was also appreciated.
Again and again, it was about the experience of living together in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke animated the short breaks with short interviews with the interpreters or hints about her work.
Humberg learned that he had actually studied chemistry, but now he also taught guitar.
Franke knew from the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest.
And Alvin Jasic has meanwhile placed everything on YouTube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
For the favourites of the jury there was nevertheless something special - so that others can even hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Hemig with his Hiltrup hit, which particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tolle.
Like everyone else, the children performed again to the finale - and even without electronic support sounded "right good", as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, relation to Hiltrup, catchiness of melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She considered the event a complete success.
Everyone was "very happy", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The Word Game: "Decrypto" in Game Test
The players form two teams that are facing one another.
For each page there is a screen, in which four maps with keywords, which you can decipher - the old trick with the red slide - only after you put them in.
Thus it is guaranteed that the opposite side cannot read anything by mistake.
For example, the maps read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
Second window.
Three dice.
4th Festival".
These are the terms that must be encrypted from now on.
Because here we should not guess the terms, but codes.
One player per team alternates is the encryptor.
He gets a code card that might say "3.4.2.".
In "Decrypto" they should not guess the terms behind the cover, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this sequence and example - the terms "cure", "fix" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not as much as possible; because the game wins if he manages to crack the code twice.
So the encryptor notes and reads aloud: "Throw" for the cubes, "Lose" as a contrast to Fest; here, of course, something like "party" would be possible and "Prague" because he paid attention at school and knows the window crash there.
So it goes round by round, team by team.
One does not know the concepts of the opposite side - but they can be better combined with any hint the encryptor gives there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too crazy, the descriptions should be, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic to "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players probably have to study it for quite a long time and in detail until they can play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info on the web makes it easier.
But once you get started, you will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous match.
But overall "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as predecessors and genre primus "Codenames", which is also an agent theme for a game of less words, but much better to play in small groups.
And who is only concerned with guessing and not with winning points, can easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler salute and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach twice on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
He first showed Hitler's greetings in the Upper City of a passing police patrol, later he also appeared in a bar when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholized by the police, he had to spend the night in the detention cell at the Kulmbach police inspection.
In a sober state, he must then also be held liable for the use of signs of unconstitutional organisations in criminal proceedings. — 1 Cor. 12: 10.
Pressig factory was home to the Schubloks
The railway depot in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991 a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers popped on buffers, you heard it all over Pressig," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't upset anyone.
The brakes squealed and the wagons gnawed.
That was a train.
Statements that symbolize Dinkel's homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was such a place shaped by the railway..
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen mountain route to the north, which has its peak in Steinbach am Wald after an ascent of about 220 metres.
To cope with this, train and thrust locomotives, which had their homeland in Pressig, were needed in the past.
In 1901 the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprentice workshop, overhead line and railway master workshop.
"The heartpiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years of professional railway workers.
The Pressig railway depot, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight elloks were stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the 1939 route already minimized the need for train and thrust locomotives.
From 1977 on, they were only needed for freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10 000 weights were still placed each month.
In 1982, parts of the factory were demolished, and in 1991 the rest were demolished.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that one has not considered a better use of the site, also in terms of freight transport".
On Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous railway station festival in Pressig for the anniversary "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10 000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressig marshalling station was history.
"The shunters and hemmers did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any misconduct would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen led for the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with opening success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second lap of the Beijing tennis tournament, as they did before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French Kristina Mladenovic in the first round.
Next opponent of the world ranking third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kasachsten or the Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian who was number 13 gave up.
The Swabian is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach on the weekend as part of the series "Art and Pleasure".
With great ease registered organizers and visitors looked the ideal weather when the special opening "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the outdoor grounds of the estate Dahlmann-Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourist association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Art and pleasure".
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
The fascination of the exhibition was greatly appreciated by visitors.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be viewed in Mittelehrenbach, Germany.
Host Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening ceremony.
He's been here since the first hour.
Just like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
But Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer he put his task into proven, young hands with a good future perspective.
Both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists and have co-created flyers in the past.
This year again, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there is a 70 cent special stamp designed by them, available at any art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be acquired for eight euros.
Hahn rejoiced at the high popularity of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical framework..
When walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often decorated with colour accents.
Already at the entrance of the property awaits the visitor on the right hand side of the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightened in colour, playfully equipped with 20 windwheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bushwork in the background, the object seems magically sunk and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate herself in three-dimensional characters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts moving in the wind.
Siegrid Frey from Eckental displayed her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child" half way.
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy creation of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The topic "Windspiel-Performance" to stroll through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albanians also aired their displeasure.
At least five of them.
They did not want to accept partout with the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no sangesleben anymore in the district.
It has now become a legend: At a bench in the Tinnenbusch they raised the MGV 68 Albachten from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Meeting".
"It will be full today," assumed Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albanian singers.
They had revived the Foundation's celebration for the anniversary itself.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the festival was back.
An elegant ball it became, festive clothes had been asked before.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats in the "House of Encounters" as usual, but at tables.
In between, movement was required: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln attracted the controllers and asked for the dance floor.
It is a matter of honour that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten sounded the voice themselves.
Happy songs were announced in line with the occasion.
Almost set: "A day as beautiful as today".
Matching the exquisite grape juice that many had in store, there was the "Rüdesheimer wine".
In allusion to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" was performed, which is the Latin term for "hops".
Richard Homann, who was one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch at that time, was once again sovereign.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," said Holstiege, "He has such an easy manner, it's a feat he does." By the way, this time not only men presented themselves singing.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes Evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber sat at the desk until three in the morning to create his own rhyme.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented sounding poetry.
There was also a large tombola.
The proceeds will finance the children of the Albatros Youth Centre a visit to the Allwetterzoo.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The ascender marches.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring can be found in Liga 3.
No sign of shyness or freaking out, the independents are doing their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aase really good.
"That wasn't crystal clear, but we already left an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker agreed immediately: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not satisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the atmosphere was good, the game was ticked.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set the guests had a set ball.
"When they bring the goal to the goal, a game like this can tip," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its experienced forces and brought the full yield to the finish..
"We are all aware of who is on the other side of such a derby.
It doesn't break our necks.
I have seen really good volleyball in phases," Annacker did not argue with the 0:3 - and immediately moved to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the independent seems not foreseeable after just three days of play..
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The third league has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable with Regionalliga Volleyball". In the fourth league they don't want to look down anyway.
If the vest is not soiled in the next few weeks, they must look up.
A first balance can only be drawn after ten, eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee arrives in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
Heide Keller became a star on the dream ship.
Now she openly talks about the fact that the series could have had a co-indebtedness with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as Chief Hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "dreamship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018, she left the ship forever.
The series, which made her star, could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with which she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world alone with a suitcase and many of my admired colleagues noticed me at eye level," Keller tells in conversation with the "picture on Sunday".
At first she was always "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dreamship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it that much."
She considers it possible that her husband at that time might have been jealous, but "like many men, Hans also shunned talks about problems and emotions.".
Keller always tried to be the only one for Hans von Borsody "and he didn't want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I have disguised myself," she explains.
She had always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw me as an emancipated woman who I was never really, even though I sometimes seemed cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it might go wrong again."
The day before the civil wedding, I was in the dressing room crying and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why never worked with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had imagined love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I have approached love too naively".
The moth, who regularly explores the city's nightlife at the NZZ resort in Zurich, has ventured into the ZFF opening party this year.
Our moth is not a moth, but a little light shy.
And the glaring splendour in which a green carpet is immersed on the Sechseläutenplatz, blinds it over feeble.
But it's just film festival, more or less famous ones want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
On this late Thursday evening, he torses over the place to ease himself briefly in the "Aquaclean WC oasis".
This is the name of the public toilet system sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: The needy institution on the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
That evening, however, it stinks in the Lord's oasis for some reason to heaven.
So get out of here, over to the other side of the street: invited guests, who have just entertained the opening film "Green Book" at the best level in the cinema next door, celebrate like every year the festival start with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly to this film festival: The works shown from all over the world are known.
What do you not have to think of in an article about this festival, in order not to fall into disguise for its 190 partner companies.
The moth binds a volume around the feelers, which has given him a good fairy, and two bully doormen actually waved him generically.
Inside, the invited crowd, they dance far after midnight to live music or let DJ rhythms to which they yell at each other, and rinse down exquisite snacks with Cüpli.
In the delicacy store in the basement oysters are waiting for slurping mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain is gushing.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without big losses..
You have to love this country for it! It's a country!
The butterfly studies the shield at the escalator: "Take a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If that's two separate instructions, he's lost his dress code.
But it's rather a conditional construction, and it certainly has saved lives.
In the household goods department upstairs, the poultry man tilts a cocktail made with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily get the prize for the best beverage.
And George Clooney, who's been advertising for that badge for years, isn't here that night either.
But between local celebrities, cash desk and kitchen items, a face that is known to the observer passes by: Peter Farrelly, director of the opening film.
His lead actor shouldn't be far.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, with nearly sixty almost like a choir boy, walks through the crowd.
He's not being chatted, not beggared, you're just shooting.
International stars love this film festival especially for this restraint, often misunderstood as clutter.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dances
Coach and ex-football star Diego Maradona is happy about the win of the team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2–0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to cumbia rhythms, as shown in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in the yellow jersey, cheered by the players. I'm sorry.
The Mexican second division defeated the Leones Negros with 2:0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been working on the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: League 1: ASV Sending to Last-Minute-Pleite "destroyed to the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball club ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat". His protégés were "destroyed" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - broke - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly over long periods, the senders.
Only the initial phase "we have totally sleepy", the ASV trainer was angry.
The owners quickly led with 8:1, even the early break, which Bieletzki had taken, did not at first fruit.
"But then suddenly a jerk went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter hour.
The gap was only two goals for the break.
Especially Sending Best, Marius Hintze, met in the phase another time.
After the change it became even better from the visitor's perspective.
After 33 minutes David Ernst compared to 15:15, the relay changer led almost consistently.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly soothing three hits (29:26).
And then?
Put the impartials into action.
Bieletzki usually avoids the guilt of others.
But: The 120-second time penalty Steffen Mühlhoff collected was "a joke."
LIT had a good laugh and hit four times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood well in the back against seven men and threw again and again at the empty goal.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damned victory has to come," said Bieletzki.
ASV gates: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police digs for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (Landkreis Hof), the police are looking for the remains of the woman.
Forces dug up a road in Marxgrün on Saturday.
For this purpose, the pavement and several layers of it were removed, as police and prosecutors shared.
According to new evidence, missing persons may not have been buried far from their place of residence.
The woman has disappeared since November 4, 1986.
The investigators did not rule out a crime.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court and the prosecutor's office have been working intensively on the case again.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators encountered an abnormality under the road near Marxgrün using a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained in the smell of human bones, the officials narrowed the area to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers lie in the web.
However, users themselves can also provide additional safety.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should rather use passphrases to secure their accounts on the net.
In addition, security updates, such as Windows, should be installed quickly, nor does it harm to equip computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his imminent dismissal as head of the billion dollar company.
He and the U.S. Exchange Supervision SEC filed an extrajudicial lawsuit over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay 20 million dollars each, and Musk also gives up the office of Chairman for three years, a position comparable to that of the German Supervisory Board.
He may remain Chief Executive Officer.
In the settlement, which still has to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager before the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who is also in charge of SpaceX, is the public face of the losing electric car pioneer, which is now valued at over $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is not aware of guilt
Musk explained that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the complaint.

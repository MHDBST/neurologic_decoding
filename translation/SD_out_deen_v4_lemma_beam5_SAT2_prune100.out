DFB CEO Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil to return to the national team.
"This is a question that of course depends on one getting into the conversation, that one also talks to him about why he apparently felt one or the other as it is stated in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasic mower" of the "Image-Newspaper".
Despite the month-long debate over Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of 92-time national player Özeil.
"I would have been pleased if Mesut Özil had continued playing for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would be so," said Grindel.
De 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified him by the fact that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to put up any pressure, but he knows it from football so that when "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a pity that this conversation has not yet come about".
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burnt
At 2.13 p.m., the professional fire brigade Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a power line leads directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, there was a risk in delay.
The fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire when it arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically in its entirety and fire debris removed to the absolutely necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden cabin, he had a battery to charge for lunch.
That might be the cause of fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the range of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire must still be determined - as must the cause of the fire.
However, it should be considerable, for the owner had many collectors' items in his garden hut.
Angry mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open street
What drove Lindsay Lohan to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has streamed live herself as she apparently wants to snatch children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and releases a partial recording of the stream.
Here you can see "Good luck kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows how Lohan gets out of a car and goes to a possibly homeless family that she wants as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees the actress, Lohan pursues her parents and children.
She accuses adults of doing child trafficking.
She doesn't give any evidence for all this in the clip.
"The whole world is watching this right now," Lohan says in the video, as she continues to follow the family along the street.
Apparently, she tries to separate the children from her parents.
Eventually, however, it seems that the obviously angry mother is enough.
Looks like she's turning around and slapping Lohan.
In tears, the actress affirms how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What prompted Lohan to do so is currently completely unclear.

Party Congress of British Conservatives
Sharply guarded - the Tories Congress
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party congress is about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the forefront of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.

Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") is Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in Brazil is divided.
Thousands went to the streets in several cities to protest Jair Bolsonaro, the right-wing populist.
The "Trump Brazil" acts as an anti-system candidate and is thus in the lead in the surveys.
His sharpest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Labor Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" finishing takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force still exists," said Peter Mertens, Chief Development Officer, to the industry journal "Automobile Week".
In December 2017, Audi CEO Rupert Stadler, who was imprisoned and on leave, announced that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"All engine/gear combinations are expected to be tested in the first quarter of 2018, he said.
Mertens said: "At the beginning of July we reached an important milestone in the process of addressing the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi parent Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made "serious organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board had adjourned a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and wants to discuss it further this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi chief of having authorised the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust gas values after they become aware of the fraud.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
At present, the company is headed by the sales director Bram Schot as acting CEO.
Due to the switch to the new exhaust gas and consumption test standard WLTP, there were production failures at Audi, said Schot the "Heilbronner Voice".
In principle, he sees a declining demand for saloons such as Audi A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel strives for re-election - Lahm should join the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run again for office as DFB President in the coming year, despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel as a guest at ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" early Sunday morning.
You have to keep trying to re-election, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
The head of the association would find it "notable" in his own words if he did not "want to work on the future project" after the match for the 2024 European Championship.
Grindel has been the head of the association since April 2016 as the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, who fell over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place at the German Federal Day on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM chief organizer Philipp Lahm will work in the DFB Bureau.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would continue to advise the Bureau in this role and then, of course, be warmly invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," said Grindel, who said: "I am very pleased that my colleagues on the Bureau agree that he will continue to be consulted in the Committee Bureau.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB boss.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future he would become a national player without a migration background.
Currently, this office is held by the Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon.
"If one without a migrant background is clearly involved in society and football and says, "the issue is important, we have to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local associations where integration must work," said Grindel.
Properly reduce with half-wise scale
I've been holding a new toy for four weeks.
A balance that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat content.
It can also show muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it's more for the sausage.
Don't tell him if I replaced fat with muscle.

Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement who are living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens wherever they live.
We will not allow the PKK or Gülen Movement sympathizers to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship," he said..

DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil to return to the national team.
"This is a question that, of course, depends on the fact that you get into the conversation, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one or the other as stated in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasic mower" of the "Image newspaper.
Despite the month-long debate over Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of 92-time national player ÖzIL.
"I would have been very pleased if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would happen," said Grindel.
De 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and had also explained that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with Federal coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to put up any pressure, but he knows it from football so that when "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a pity that this conversation has not yet come about".
Linz: Garden hut burned in Schrebergartensiedlung
At 2.13 p.m., the professional fire brigade Linz was alerted to a fire in Angererhofweg.
Because a power line leads directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, danger was delayed.
The fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire on arrival.
The roof had to be removed practically in its entirety and fire debris removed to the absolute extent required.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery to charge for lunch.
That might be the cause of fire.
In any case, according to the fire brigade, the charger was in the range of the biggest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still has to be determined - just as the cause of the fire.
However, it should be considerable, for the owner had many collectors' items in his garden hut.
Angry mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the open road
What drove Lindsay Lohan to this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has streamed live herself, as she apparently wants to snatch children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and releases a partial recording of the stream.
Here you see "Luckily kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows how Lohan gets out of a car and goes to a possibly homeless family that she wants as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees the actress, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
She accuses adults of child trafficking.
She doesn't provide any evidence for all this in the clip.
"The whole world sees it right now," Lohan says in the video, as she continues to follow the family along the street.
She apparently tries to separate the children from her parents.
Eventually, however, the obviously angry mother seems to be enough.
Looks like she's turning around and slapping Lohan.
In tears, the actress asserts how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What prompted Lohan to do so is currently completely unclear.

"Ele Nao" ("The Not") is Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the country's mood is divided.

Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force is still in existence," said Peter Mertens, Chief Development Officer, to the industry journal "Automobile Week".
In December 2017, Audi CEO Rupert Stadler, who was imprisoned and on leave, announced that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"All engine/gear combinations are expected to be tested in the first quarter of 2018, he said.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in addressing the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi parent Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car maker had made "serious organizational changes" so that such a scandal never occurred again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and will continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi chief of having approved the sale of diesel cars with incorrect exhaust gas values after they become aware of the flue gas fraud.
He had known about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Bram Schot currently heads the company as acting CEO.
Due to the change to the new exhaust gas and consumption test standard WLTP there were production failures at Audi, said Schot the "Heilbronn Voice".
In principle, he sees a declining demand for saloons such as Audi A6, A7 and A8, produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot puts emphasis on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations in the shop..
Grindel strives for re-election - Lahm to join the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run again for office as DFB President in the coming year, despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel as a guest early Sunday morning at ZDF's "Current Sports Studio".
You always have to make a re-election effort, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
The head of the association would find it "notable" in his own words if he did not "want to work on the future project" after the match for the 2024 European Football Championship.
Grindel has been the head of the association since April 2016 as the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, who fell over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first complete three-year term.
The next vote will take place at the German Federal Day on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM chief organizer Philipp Lahm will work in the DFB Bureau.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would continue to advise the Bureau in this role and then, of course, be warmly invited to provide his experience on sporting issues," said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB boss.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a national player without a migrant background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, this office is held by the native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon.
"If one without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says that "the issue is important, we have to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local associations where integration must work," said Grindel.
Properly decrease with half wise scale
I've had a new toy in four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat content.
It can also show muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it's more for the sausage.
Doesn't he say I replaced fat with muscle?

DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil to return to the national team.
"This is a question that, of course, depends on the fact that you get into the conversation, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one or the other as stated in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasic mower" of the "Image newspaper.
Despite the month-long debate over Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of 92-time national player ÖzIL.
"I would have been very pleased if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would happen," said Grindel.
De 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and had also explained that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with Federal coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to put up any pressure, but he knows it from football so that when "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a pity that this conversation has not yet come about".
Linz: Garden hut burned in Schrebergartensiedlung
At 2.13 p.m., the professional fire brigade Linz was alerted to a fire in Angererhofweg.
Because a power line leads directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, danger was delayed.
The fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire on arrival.
The roof had to be removed practically in its entirety and fire debris removed to the absolute extent required.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery to charge for lunch.
That might be the cause of fire.
In any case, according to the fire brigade, the charger was in the range of the biggest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still has to be determined - just as the cause of the fire.
However, it should be considerable, for the owner had many collectors' items in his garden hut.
Angry mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the open road
What drove Lindsay Lohan to this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has streamed live herself, as she apparently wants to snatch children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and releases a partial recording of the stream.
Here you see "Luckily kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows how Lohan gets out of a car and goes to a possibly homeless family that she wants as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees the actress, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
She accuses adults of child trafficking.
She doesn't provide any evidence for all this in the clip.
"The whole world sees it right now," Lohan says in the video, as she continues to follow the family along the street.
She apparently tries to separate the children from her parents.
Eventually, however, the obviously angry mother seems to be enough.
Looks like she's turning around and slapping Lohan.
In tears, the actress asserts how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What prompted Lohan to do so is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is said to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander Mascot will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: Number of deaths on Sulawesi increases to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there are at least 420 deaths.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams have not yet penetrated the devastated areas, cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Supervisor
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused trouble in the stock markets at the beginning of August when he announced a withdrawal of the Eletroautomaker.
The U.S. authorities sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the CEO is withdrawing from the Supervisory Board.
Party congress of British Conservatives
Sharply guarded - the party congress of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party congress is about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the forefront of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a country in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these names for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and the population will vote on this Sunday - whether it is going well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") is Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the country's mood is divided.
Thousands went to the streets in several cities to protest against right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump Brazil" acts as an anti-system candidate and is thus in the lead in the surveys.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Labour Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force is still in existence," said Peter Mertens, Chief Development Officer, to the industry journal "Automobile Week".
In December 2017, Audi CEO Rupert Stadler, who was imprisoned and on leave, announced that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"All engine/gear combinations are expected to be tested in the first quarter of 2018, he said.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in addressing the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi parent Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car maker had made "serious organizational changes" so that such a scandal never occurred again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and will continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi chief of having approved the sale of diesel cars with incorrect exhaust gas values after they become aware of the flue gas fraud.
He had known about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Bram Schot currently heads the company as acting CEO.
Due to the change to the new exhaust gas and consumption test standard WLTP there were production failures at Audi, said Schot the "Heilbronn Voice".
In principle, he sees a declining demand for saloons such as Audi A6, A7 and A8, produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot puts emphasis on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations in the shop..
Grindel strives for re-election - Lahm to join the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run again for office as DFB President in the coming year, despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel as a guest early Sunday morning at ZDF's "Current Sports Studio".
You always have to make a re-election effort, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
The head of the association would find it "notable" in his own words if he did not "want to work on the future project" after the match for the 2024 European Football Championship.
Grindel has been the head of the association since April 2016 as the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, who fell over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first complete three-year term.
The next vote will take place at the German Federal Day on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM chief organizer Philipp Lahm will work in the DFB Bureau.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would continue to advise the Bureau in this role and then, of course, be warmly invited to provide his experience on sporting issues," said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB boss.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a national player without a migrant background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, this office is held by the native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon.
"If one without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says that "the issue is important, we have to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local associations where integration must work," said Grindel.
Properly decrease with half wise scale
I've had a new toy in four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat content.
It can also show muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it's more for the sausage.
Doesn't he say I replaced fat with muscle?
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear opening successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started with a clear victory in the new season of the German basketball league.
Against Science City Jena, the vice-champion won 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing match over 40 minutes.
New addition Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliner with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counters) from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators at his official debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won the mandatory game debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at see Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower at the guests with 24 points in the race, and was also the best.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 counters.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76.
New national player Karim Jallow was in the team of coach John Patrick with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
The Basketball Löwen Braunschweig had a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new gamemaker Will Cummings dominated the Oldenburgers with 25 points.
The Braunschweigers, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been a majority owner since the beginning of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the Baskets quickly ensured clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to oppose Kurdish separatists.
We'll protect our citizens wherever they live.
We will not allow Sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, Cologne city centre was partially closed.
Several thousand policemen were in action - including snipers.
The Islam Association Ditib is critical because it is regarded as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and Schrecksekunde
Musicians like Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have campaigned for more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert at Central Park in New York.
"Commit wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night in front of around 60,000 spectators.
Thanks for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B performed in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I sweat, but it's okay, because I am here ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and relief organizations also showed up at the multi-hour spectacle on stage.
In between, however, there was a scare second, when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was gunshot, scared and tried to escape.
In short, panic arose, people ran into confusion.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed people down from the stage.
"No one tries to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Those who wanted to get one had to read and spread texts, photos and videos on the global fight against poverty and diseases on internet.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applause from the audience - shouts for the Republican senator Jeff Flake.
He spoke together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage for more equal rights for men and women, although he also spoke out in favour of equal rights.
On Friday, however, Flake spoke out for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court in the U.S. Senate's Judiciary Committee, thus throwing many women at their heads.
At least three women have filed abuse charges up to attempted rape against Kavanaugh, who rejects them.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the charges after two women, who claimed to have experienced sexual assaults themselves, confronted him in an elevator on the way to committee meeting.
"You can also come with me in an elevator at any time," Flake said at the concert in New York to the crowd.
Freedom of the press: German government defends the dismissal of the journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the dismissal of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the chancellor's office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had overlaid a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was about interrupting the press conference.
The journalist's action caused a great deal of unrest, which was unacceptable.
He had caused personal guards to take the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, numerous journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for a failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are threatened with several decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are also unsure of the Turkish authorities: the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested in early September.
Most recently, the cases of detained journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
Although they came free and were able to return to Germany, there are still trials in Turkey against them.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him as fresh and handsome: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look there twice: Yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and he had a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for happy conversations at the counter of the Hamburg harbour pub "Schellfishposten".
Moderator Ina Müller meets with her guests some beer, some wine or even higher-percent drinks to loosen the mood and tongue.
Not a few celebrities also take courage for the obligatory vocal performances.
On Friday another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time the actor Florian David Fitz is known from movies like "Männerherzen", "Terror - Ihr Bewertung" or "Der gelsten Tag".
However, the trip to the far north did not get well for the Munich.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely snarled on it, his eyes only two small slits are still.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful hangover.
Addressed to his fans, he posted some - probably not quite serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER goes to Inas Nacht.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And splash.
And leave the round egg liqueur that Ina throws at 6:30.
Alcohol consumption is truly written on the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips to fight the afterlife.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - probably the most target - headache tablets.
Others simply had fun watching the usually attractive movie star.
It is not known how Ina Müller survived the nightly bouncing.
Since she moderates the TV fun at the counter already since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more proven...
To a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa struggles with vandalism and treason
The entry into the 36-kilometre-long railway cycle path in the Red Riding Hoodland in Treysa is difficult to find and is wasteful.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are sought, but solutions are barely apparent.
Shards, cigarette dumps, garbage and debris, demolished trash cans and now dismantled signposts - this is how the entry with seating group to the cycle path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the flagship railway bike trail in Red Riding Hoodland a more than unfamous sight.
The topic has been occupied by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for some time, according to the bicycle traffic officer of the city Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been addressed in the cycling advisory board.
There has been no solution.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to regular emptying of waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the imperative of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been included in the local council of the council.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents around - the group is regular meeting place for celebrations on weekends.
Not only is it often loud, but it is also destroyed in the situation: posts torn from the ground, trash cans demolished, signs bent around, seat furniture greased.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are angry that the resting place on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for drinking.
"The focus is clearly on the Haaße hill along the entire cycle path," confirms the bicycle traffic officer, who is now also worried about the new bike park in Ziegenhain, which is opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it'll be really expensive."
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "Perhaps this sets the threshold significantly higher to attack common property.
However, this would assume that a police patrol will pass in time.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaße hill.
He needed to be made more attractive.
One could be very satisfied with the frequenting of the cycle path.
Tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bicycle path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany," says the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger, ADFC member Susanne Klippert assesses the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There's no turning trail on the Haaße hill.
In case of heavy traffic, it can happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between the two-way traffic flows," she explains.
This is no problem for sporty drivers, but probably for older people and particularly for children.
Music Contest in the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the Music Contest was a success, creative and in cooperation.
"D ein Lied für Hiltrup", is the appeal of the district offensive Hilstrup, in the "Music contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family affair with coffee and cakes from the volunteers of the cultural station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long Albanian living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and Zwarties.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We haven't seen this in other districts.
What did the copywriters see connected to?
Lake Hiltruper and market avenue were particularly frequently mentioned in the villages.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his pop song.
The Kulturbahnhof was also appreciated.
Again and again it was about the experience of living together in these places, particularly with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short breaks with short interviews with the interpreters or hints about her work.
Humberg was told that he actually studied chemistry, but now he also teaches guitar.
Franke knew from the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he had recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has meanwhile placed everything on YouTube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said, "but I'm not going to win."
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
For the favourites of the jury there was nevertheless something special - so that others can also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record a complete CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Hemig with his Hiltrup hit, which particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tolle.
Like everyone else, the children performed again for the finale - and even sounded "real good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, relation to Hiltrup, catchiness of melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund and Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive launched the event on the occasion of its tenth anniversary.
She rated the event as a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test

DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil to return to the national team.
"This is a question that, of course, depends on the fact that you get into the conversation, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one or the other as stated in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasic mower" of the "Image newspaper.
Despite the month-long debate over Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of 92-time national player ÖzIL.
"I would have been very pleased if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would happen," said Grindel.
De 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and had also explained that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with Federal coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to put up any pressure, but he knows it from football so that when "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a pity that this conversation has not yet come about".
Linz: Garden hut burned in Schrebergartensiedlung
At 2.13 p.m., the professional fire brigade Linz was alerted to a fire in Angererhofweg.
Because a power line leads directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, danger was delayed.
The fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire on arrival.
The roof had to be removed practically in its entirety and fire debris removed to the absolute extent required.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery to charge for lunch.
That might be the cause of fire.
In any case, according to the fire brigade, the charger was in the range of the biggest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still has to be determined - just as the cause of the fire.
However, it should be considerable, for the owner had many collectors' items in his garden hut.
Angry mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the open road
What drove Lindsay Lohan to this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has streamed live herself, as she apparently wants to snatch children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and releases a partial recording of the stream.
Here you see "Luckily kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows how Lohan gets out of a car and goes to a possibly homeless family that she wants as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees the actress, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
She accuses adults of child trafficking.
She doesn't provide any evidence for all this in the clip.
"The whole world sees it right now," Lohan says in the video, as she continues to follow the family along the street.
She apparently tries to separate the children from her parents.
Eventually, however, the obviously angry mother seems to be enough.
Looks like she's turning around and slapping Lohan.
In tears, the actress asserts how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What prompted Lohan to do so is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is said to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander Mascot will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: Number of deaths on Sulawesi increases to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there are at least 420 deaths.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams have not yet penetrated the devastated areas, cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Supervisor
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused trouble in the stock markets at the beginning of August when he announced a withdrawal of the Eletroautomaker.
The U.S. authorities sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the CEO is withdrawing from the Supervisory Board.
Party congress of British Conservatives
Sharply guarded - the party congress of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party congress is about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the forefront of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a country in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these names for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and the population will vote on this Sunday - whether it is going well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") is Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the country's mood is divided.
Thousands went to the streets in several cities to protest against right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump Brazil" acts as an anti-system candidate and is thus in the lead in the surveys.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Labour Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force is still in existence," said Peter Mertens, Chief Development Officer, to the industry journal "Automobile Week".
In December 2017, Audi CEO Rupert Stadler, who was imprisoned and on leave, announced that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"All engine/gear combinations are expected to be tested in the first quarter of 2018, he said.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in addressing the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi parent Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car maker had made "serious organizational changes" so that such a scandal never occurred again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and will continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi chief of having approved the sale of diesel cars with incorrect exhaust gas values after they become aware of the flue gas fraud.
He had known about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Bram Schot currently heads the company as acting CEO.
Due to the change to the new exhaust gas and consumption test standard WLTP there were production failures at Audi, said Schot the "Heilbronn Voice".
In principle, he sees a declining demand for saloons such as Audi A6, A7 and A8, produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot puts emphasis on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations in the shop..
Grindel strives for re-election - Lahm to join the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run again for office as DFB President in the coming year, despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel as a guest early Sunday morning at ZDF's "Current Sports Studio".
You always have to make a re-election effort, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
The head of the association would find it "notable" in his own words if he did not "want to work on the future project" after the match for the 2024 European Football Championship.
Grindel has been the head of the association since April 2016 as the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, who fell over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first complete three-year term.
The next vote will take place at the German Federal Day on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM chief organizer Philipp Lahm will work in the DFB Bureau.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would continue to advise the Bureau in this role and then, of course, be warmly invited to provide his experience on sporting issues," said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB boss.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a national player without a migrant background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, this office is held by the native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon.
"If one without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says that "the issue is important, we have to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local associations where integration must work," said Grindel.
Properly decrease with half wise scale
I've had a new toy in four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat content.
It can also show muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it's more for the sausage.
Doesn't he say I replaced fat with muscle?
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear opening successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started with a clear victory in the new season of the German basketball league.
Against Science City Jena, the vice-champion won 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing match over 40 minutes.
New addition Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliner with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counters) from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators at his official debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won the mandatory game debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at see Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower at the guests with 24 points in the race, and was also the best.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 counters.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76.
New national player Karim Jallow was in the team of coach John Patrick with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
The Basketball Löwen Braunschweig had a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new gamemaker Will Cummings dominated the Oldenburgers with 25 points.
The Braunschweigers, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been a majority owner since the beginning of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the Baskets quickly ensured clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to oppose Kurdish separatists.
We'll protect our citizens wherever they live.
We will not allow Sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, Cologne city centre was partially closed.
Several thousand policemen were in action - including snipers.
The Islam Association Ditib is critical because it is regarded as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and Schrecksekunde
Musicians like Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have campaigned for more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert at Central Park in New York.
"Commit wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night in front of around 60,000 spectators.
Thanks for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B performed in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I sweat, but it's okay, because I am here ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and relief organizations also showed up at the multi-hour spectacle on stage.
In between, however, there was a scare second, when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was gunshot, scared and tried to escape.
In short, panic arose, people ran into confusion.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed people down from the stage.
"No one tries to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Those who wanted to get one had to read and spread texts, photos and videos on the global fight against poverty and diseases on internet.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applause from the audience - shouts for the Republican senator Jeff Flake.
He spoke together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage for more equal rights for men and women, although he also spoke out in favour of equal rights.
On Friday, however, Flake spoke out for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court in the U.S. Senate's Judiciary Committee, thus throwing many women at their heads.
At least three women have filed abuse charges up to attempted rape against Kavanaugh, who rejects them.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the charges after two women, who claimed to have experienced sexual assaults themselves, confronted him in an elevator on the way to committee meeting.
"You can also come with me in an elevator at any time," Flake said at the concert in New York to the crowd.
Freedom of the press: German government defends the dismissal of the journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the dismissal of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the chancellor's office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had overlaid a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was about interrupting the press conference.
The journalist's action caused a great deal of unrest, which was unacceptable.
He had caused personal guards to take the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, numerous journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for a failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are threatened with several decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are also unsure of the Turkish authorities: the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested in early September.
Most recently, the cases of detained journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
Although they came free and were able to return to Germany, there are still trials in Turkey against them.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him as fresh and handsome: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look there twice: Yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and he had a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for happy conversations at the counter of the Hamburg harbour pub "Schellfishposten".
Moderator Ina Müller meets with her guests some beer, some wine or even higher-percent drinks to loosen the mood and tongue.
Not a few celebrities also take courage for the obligatory vocal performances.
On Friday another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time the actor Florian David Fitz is known from movies like "Männerherzen", "Terror - Ihr Bewertung" or "Der gelsten Tag".
However, the trip to the far north did not get well for the Munich.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely snarled on it, his eyes only two small slits are still.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful hangover.
Addressed to his fans, he posted some - probably not quite serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER goes to Inas Nacht.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And splash.
And leave the round egg liqueur that Ina throws at 6:30.
Alcohol consumption is truly written on the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips to fight the afterlife.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - probably the most target - headache tablets.
Others simply had fun watching the usually attractive movie star.
It is not known how Ina Müller survived the nightly bouncing.
Since she moderates the TV fun at the counter already since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more proven...
To a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa struggles with vandalism and treason
The entry into the 36-kilometre-long railway cycle path in the Red Riding Hoodland in Treysa is difficult to find and is wasteful.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are sought, but solutions are barely apparent.
Shards, cigarette dumps, garbage and debris, demolished trash cans and now dismantled signposts - this is how the entry with seating group to the cycle path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the flagship railway bike trail in Red Riding Hoodland a more than unfamous sight.
The topic has been occupied by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for some time, according to the bicycle traffic officer of the city Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been addressed in the cycling advisory board.
There has been no solution.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to regular emptying of waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the imperative of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been included in the local council of the council.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents around - the group is regular meeting place for celebrations on weekends.
Not only is it often loud, but it is also destroyed in the situation: posts torn from the ground, trash cans demolished, signs bent around, seat furniture greased.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are angry that the resting place on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for drinking.
"The focus is clearly on the Haaße hill along the entire cycle path," confirms the bicycle traffic officer, who is now also worried about the new bike park in Ziegenhain, which is opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it'll be really expensive."
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "Perhaps this sets the threshold significantly higher to attack common property.
However, this would assume that a police patrol will pass in time.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaße hill.
He needed to be made more attractive.
One could be very satisfied with the frequenting of the cycle path.
Tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bicycle path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany," says the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger, ADFC member Susanne Klippert assesses the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There's no turning trail on the Haaße hill.
In case of heavy traffic, it can happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between the two-way traffic flows," she explains.
This is no problem for sporty drivers, but probably for older people and particularly for children.
Music Contest in the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the Music Contest was a success, creative and in cooperation.
"D ein Lied für Hiltrup", is the appeal of the district offensive Hilstrup, in the "Music contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family affair with coffee and cakes from the volunteers of the cultural station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long Albanian living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and Zwarties.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We haven't seen this in other districts.
What did the copywriters see connected to?
Lake Hiltruper and market avenue were particularly frequently mentioned in the villages.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his pop song.
The Kulturbahnhof was also appreciated.
Again and again it was about the experience of living together in these places, particularly with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short breaks with short interviews with the interpreters or hints about her work.
Humberg was told that he actually studied chemistry, but now he also teaches guitar.
Franke knew from the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he had recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has meanwhile placed everything on YouTube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said, "but I'm not going to win."
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
For the favourites of the jury there was nevertheless something special - so that others can also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record a complete CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Hemig with his Hiltrup hit, which particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tolle.
Like everyone else, the children performed again for the finale - and even sounded "real good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, relation to Hiltrup, catchiness of melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund and Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive launched the event on the occasion of its tenth anniversary.
She rated the event as a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams sitting opposite each other.
For each page there is a screen, in which four maps with keywords, which you can only decipher - the old trick with the red slide - once you put them in.
This ensures that the opposite side cannot read by mistake.
For example, on the cards it says to read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
Second window.
Three dice.
4th Festival".
These are the terms that need to be encoded.
It is not the terms that should be guessed here, but the codes.
One player per team alternates is the encryptor.
He gets a code card that might say "3.4.2.".
In "Decrypto" they should not guess the terms behind the secret foil, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "cure", "fix" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not as much as possible; because this wins the game if he succeeds twice in cracking the code. This is the case.
So the encryptor notes and reads aloud: "Throw" for the cubes, "Lose" as a contrast to Fest; here, of course, something like "party" would be possible and "Prague" because he paid attention at school and knows the window crash there.
This is how round by round, team by team continues.
One does not know the terms of the opposite side - but it can be better combined with any hint the encryptor gives there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too crazy, the descriptions should be, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players probably have to study it for quite a long time and extensively until they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info on the web makes it easier.
But once you get started, you'll be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
But overall "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as predecessors and genre primer "Codenames", which also puts an agent theme on a game of less words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And who is only concerned with guessing and not about victory points, can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows Hitler salute to police and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach twice the night from Saturday to Sunday.
He first showed Hitler's greetings in the Upper Town of a passing police patrol, later he also appeared in a bar in the upper town when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholized by the police, he had to spend the night at the Kulmbach police inspection in the detention cell.
In a sober state, he must then also be responsible for the use of signs of unconstitutional organizations.
Pressig factory was home to the Schubloks
The railway depot in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
==References====External links==
"When buffers popped on buffers, you heard it all over Pressig," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't upset anyone.
The brakes squealed and the wagons gnawed.
That was a train.
Statements that symbolize Dinkel's homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so influenced by the railroad.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen mountain route to the north, which has its peak in Steinbach am Wald after an ascent of about 220 metres.
To cope with this, train and thrust locomotives, which had their home in Pressig, were needed.
In 1901 the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprentice workshop, overhead line and railway workshops.
"The heartpiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and professional railway company for 47 years.
The Pressig railway depot, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight elloks were stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the 1939 line already minimized the need for train and thrust locomotives.
From 1977, they were used only for freight trains and trains.
Until 1991, at least 10,000 weights were still placed in the month.
In 1982, parts of the factory were demolished and in 1991 the rest was demolished.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that one has not considered a better use of the site, also in terms of freight transport".
On Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig for the anniversary "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressig marshalling station was history.
"The shunters and hemmers did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Every mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen led for the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures are available here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with opening success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round of the tennis tournament in Beijing as before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French Kristina Mladenovic.
Next opponent of the world ranking third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kasachsten or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro, who is a member of the World Ranking Party.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian who was number 13 abandoned.
The swäbin is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Kunst und Genuss", a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach on the weekend.
With great ease registered organizers and visitors looked the ideal weather when the special vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open area of the estate Dahlmann Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourist association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Kunst und Genuss" (Art and Pleasure) of the German Tourism Association.
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A great audience showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Host Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening ceremony.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
But Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he put his task into proven, young hands with a good future perspective.
Both have already played an active role in the selection of artists in the past and have helped shape flyers.
This year again, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there is a 70-cent special stamp, designed by them, available at every art station, which is also available.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high popularity of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical framing.
When walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
They are works of art of metal or ceramics, often with colour accents.
Already at the entrance of the property awaits the visitor on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightened in colour, playfully equipped with 20 windwheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes.
With the sun flashing through the bushwork in the background, the object seems fairytale-like and invites to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate herself to the event 15 years K&G in three-dimensional letters.
There are lots of parts moving in the wind.
Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The wind the heavenly child" halfway down the road.
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy formation of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The topic "Windspiel-Performance" to stroll through the diverse art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - this was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And also the Albanians aired their displeasure.
Five of them, at least.
They did not want to accept the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no sangesleben in the district.
It has become a legend in the meantime: At a bench in the Tinnenbusch they raised the MGV 68 Albachten from the christening.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated large in the "House of Meeting".
"It's going to be full today," said Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should stay right.
150 guests were a real success for the Albachten singers.
They had revived the foundation festival for the anniversary.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
Just in time for its 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball it became, for festive clothes had previously been asked.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats as usual in the "House of Encounters", but at tables.
In between, movement was required: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln attracted the controllers and asked for the dance floor.
It is a matter of honour that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten even sounded the voice.
Matching the occasion, happy songs were announced.
Almost set: "A day as beautiful as today".
Matching the exquisite grape juice that many had in store, there was the "Rüdesheimer wine".
In allusion to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus", which is the Latin term for "hops".
Richard Homann, who was one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch at that time, was once again sovereign.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," said Holstiege: "He has such an easy way, it's a feat he does." By the way, this time not only men performed singing.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes Evergreens from the 20's to the 60's. It is also available in German.
Finally, there was still poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had been sitting at the desk until three in the morning to create his own rhyme.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented delicious poetry.
There was also a large tombola.
The proceeds will be used to finance the children of the Albatros Youth Centre a visit to the Allwetterzoo (all weather zoo).

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class Derby against BW Aasee
The ascender marches.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring can be found in League 3.
No sign of shyness or flaws, the independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aase really good.
"That wasn't crystal clear, but we already left an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker agreed immediately: "This is a defeat we can live very well with.
On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game tacked off, and the party started.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
The guests had a set ball in the third set.
"If they bring that to the goal, a game like this can tip," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its routined forces and brought the full yield to the finish.
"We all know who's on the other side of a derby.
It doesn't break our necks.
I have seen quite good volleyball in phases," Annacker did not argue with the 0:3 - and immediately moved to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the independent doesn't seem to be foreseeable after just three days.
"It is simply too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The third league has an incredible level.
This is not nearly comparable with Regionalliga Volleyball". In the fourth league they no longer want to look down anyway.
If the vest is not stained in the next few weeks, they must look up.
However, the first balance can only be drawn after ten, eleven games.
On Saturday we will first go to Emlichheim.
Aasee arrives in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
Heide Keller became a star on the dream ship.
Now she speaks openly about the fact that the series might have had a co-inflict with Hans von Borsody on her marriage-off.
Her role as Chief Hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "dreamship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018, she left for good.
The series, which made her star, could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with which she married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world alone with a suitcase and many of my admired colleagues noticed me at eye level," says Keller in conversation with the "picture on Sunday".
At first she was always "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dreamship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it that much."
She considers it possible that her husband at that time might have been jealous, but "like many men, Hans also shunned conversations about problems and feelings".
Keller always tried to be the only one for Hans von Borsody "and he did not want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I disguised myself," she explains.
She has always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw me as an emancipated woman who I was never really, even though I sometimes appeared bold and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be always."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it might go wrong again."
The day before the civil wedding I was sitting crying in the dressing room and wanted to cancel everything.
Borsody's marriage also failed.
Why has it never worked out with the men?
'Cause I wanted too much.
Keller had imagined love back then "as in the film.
Unfortunately this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I approached love too naively".
The moth, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city at the NZZ resort in Zurich, has ventured into the ZFF opening party.
Our moth is not a moth, but a little light shy.
And the glaring splendour in which a green carpet is immersed on the Sechseläutenplatz, blinds it over a fee.
But it's just movie festival, more or less famous ones want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
On this late Thursday evening, he torses over the square to ease himself briefly in the Aquaclean WC oasis.
This is the name of the public toilet system sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: The needy institution on the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
That evening, however, it stinks to heaven in the Lord's Oase for some reason.
So get out of here, over to the other side of the street: invited guests, who have just entertained the opening film "Green Book" at the best level in the cinema next door, celebrate the beginning of the festival with a party at the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly to this film festival: The works shown from all over the world are known.
What do you not have to think of in an article about this festival in order not to fall into disguise for its 190 partner companies.
The moth binds a volume around the feelers, which has given him a good fairy, and two bully bouncers actually wave him in generically.
Inside, the invited crowd, they dance to live music far after midnight, or let DJs pretend rhythms to which they yell at each other, and rinse down exquisite snacks with Cüpli.
In the delicacy shop in the basement oysters are waiting for slurping mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it appears to work without major losses.
You gotta love this country for it!
The moth studies the sign at the escalator: "Take a long dress, please beware on the escalator".
If that's two separate instructions, he's gone into the dress code.
But it's rather a conditional construction, and it certainly has saved lives.
In the household goods department upstairs, the poultry drop a cocktail made with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
The price for the best drink is not necessarily the price of this mix with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been advertising for that brand for years, is not here that night.
But between local celebrities, cash table and kitchen items, a face that is known to the observer passes by: Peter Farrelly, director of the opening film.
His lead actor shouldn't be far.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, with nearly sixty almost like a choir boy, walks through the crowd.
He's not being chatted, not beggared, you're shooting at all.
Especially for this restraint, often misunderstood as clutter, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dances
Coach and ex-football star Diego Maradona is delighted with the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2–0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to cumbia rhythms, as shown in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member Maradona dances in the yellow jersey, cheered by the players.
On Saturday, the Mexican second division defeated the Leones Negros with 2:0.
After the game Maradona shouted into a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has trained the Mexican club since early September.
Handball: League 1: ASV Sending to last minute "destroyed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the Handball-Verbandsligisten ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: " Such a bitter defeat". His protégés were "destroyed" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly over long periods, senders.
Only the initial phase "we have totally sleepy", the ASV trainer became angry.
The owners quickly led with 8:1, even the early break which Bieletzki had taken, did not at first fruit.
"But then suddenly a jerk went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter.
The gap was only two goals at the break.
Especially Sending Best, Marius Hintze, met in the phase another time.
After the change, it got even better from the visitor's perspective.
After 33 minutes David Ernst compared to 15:15, the relay changer led almost continuously.
Four minutes before the siren the lead was still seemingly calming three hits (29:26).
And then?
Put the impartials into action.
Bieletzki usually avoids blaming others.
But: The 120-second time penalty Steffen Mühlhoff collected was "a joke."
LIT had a good laugh and hit four times until the end - while the decimated ASV failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood well in the back against seven men and threw again and again at the empty goal.
But they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damned victory must come," said Bieletzki.
ASV gates: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bayern: Woman Missed for 30 Years - Police Dig for Body Parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (Landkreis Hof), the police search for the remains of the woman.
Force forces dug up a street near Marxgrün on Saturday.
For this purpose, the pavement and several layers of it were removed, as police and prosecutors shared.
According to new evidence, missing persons may not have been buried far away from their place of residence.
The woman has disappeared since November 4, 1986.
The investigators did not rule out a crime back then.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court has been working intensively on the case, together with the prosecutor's office.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators encountered an abnormality under the road near Marxgrün.
With the help of a dog trained in the smell of human bones, the officers narrowed the spot to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.

Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, escaped his imminent dismissal as head of the billion dollar company.
He and the U.S. Exchange Supervision SEC filed an extrajudicial lawsuit over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay 20 million dollars each, and Musk also gives up the office of Chairman for three years, a position comparable to that of the German Chairman.
He may remain CEO.
In the settlement, which must be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world's well-known manager before the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who is also in charge of SpaceX, is the public face of the losing electric car pioneer, which is now valued at over $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is aware of no guilt
Musk explained that he did not do anything wrong and was sad and disappointed with the complaint.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter supporters that he would perhaps take the company off the stock exchange, paying 420 dollars per share, the financing being secured.
As a result, Tesla would have been valued at 72 billion dollars.
Later Musk rowed back: Tesla remains on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla now needs to find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members and also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communication.

Polls: 46 percent do not want Merkel as Chancellor until 2021
After the scrambles of the past weeks, GroKo collects several poll lows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in an interview - Angela Merkel is viewed critically.
Berlin - The AfD overtakes the SPD for the first time in the Emnid Sunday trend for the image on Sunday.
In the weekly poll of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by a counter to 17 percent, the SPD scores one point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
That is the lowest value for the Union on Sunday.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If the Bundestag elections were held on Sunday, the ruling parties SPD, CDU and CSU would, according to Emnid, get only 43 percent of the votes.
As a result, the large coalition has currently lost a majority on the Sunday issue at all major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach.
The ruling parties reach 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allesbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag election, they received 53.4% together.
For the other parties, the range is also wide: the AfD, in several surveys second largest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach votes of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is an average of 10 percent and FDP 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent upwards and downwards depending on the vote.
But the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also declined significantly since the 2017 parliamentary election.
At present, only 48 percent of citizens still find that Merkel is the right person in the Chancellery, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS revealed.
According to the poll, only one in two (50 percent) currently wants the grand coalition to hold a three-year term until the next regular Bundestag election, 41 percent for a new election.
A further survey published on Saturday had also seen significant losses in popularity for Merkel.
The Germans also judge split whether Merkel should again run for the CDU presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, 44 percent against.
Thus, 64 percent of the Union's supporters want candidacy, 35 percent not.
Aushang bei Aldi: Price reduced to happiness in love
Is Aldi becoming Tinder 2.0?
Who says in times of Tinder there are no more romantic acquaintance stories - should talk about turkey meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket radiates almost an anachronistic romance as a meeting place for great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer short bargain at the Wühltisch or the favorite pudding is still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app stands in the reputation of being less a contact, rather a slippery stock market.
We have dared the test: How do women react, you don't talk around the hot bush for long in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
Rule-right Hollywood Lovestory potential has it when the love luck precedes an out-of-the-eye-lost-and-found plot.
If the guy also registers at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de with his loved ones, then that sounds like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at its best.
So it is the author of this advertisement in a Aldi branch unknown to us to wish that she will also find her dream man, with whom she briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic putty".
She definitely deserves her Happy End à la Hollywood to believe in the magic of getting to know analog.
Billerbeck: 500 Lids for life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgeri School has been participating in the action "Liddle against polio - 500 covers for a life without polio".

The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can so far only be contained by vaccination, as a press release states.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand peace for Götze
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB Sports Director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus called for an end to the public discussion on form and fitness of Mario Götze.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.

Zorc had already emphasized before the game.
Personally, this is not an easy situation.

Football: Bezirksliga: Researchers appearance of VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch went to court with his friends hard.
Wortkarg, coach of VfL Wolbeck, retired (inside) to reflect on the lack of commitment on the green.
All story.
In the meantime it is running around the Brandhoveweg again.
Taufrischer Beleg is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past season only slightly past the ascent.
Yes, I am very satisfied with the performance.
"We have narrowed the rooms and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and visited each individual for the game, simply to say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
After 26 minutes, the coach had to change systems.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes in front waited for balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more games in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his departure (17th), Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
Almost it would have been avenged when the SCA hit dangerously in front of the Wolbeck box in minute 41 twice in person by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be master of his profession.
After the break, the VfL quickly took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters just failed.
Schroer was also late for a Thewes entry after 58 minutes.
With the change of Miles Geske, Fetsch on the left side missed another fresh cell cure.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbäumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free kick for the hosts 18 meters before the guest housing.

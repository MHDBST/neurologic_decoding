DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil to return to the national team.
"This is a question that, of course, depends on the fact that you get into the conversation, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one or the other as stated in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasic mower" of the "Image newspaper.
Despite the month-long debate over Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of 92-time national player Ozil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued playing for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would happen," said Grindel.
De 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also explained that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready to talk to coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to put up any pressure, but he knows it from football so that when "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a pity that this conversation has not come about."
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burnt
At 2.13 p.
Because a power line leads directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, danger was delayed.
The fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire on arrival.
The roof had to be practically completely removed and fire debris removed to the necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery to charge for lunch.
It could be the cause of fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the range of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still has to be determined - just like the fire cause.
It may be considerable, however, because the owner had many collectors' items in his garden hut.
Angry mother defends herself: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open street
What drove Lindsay Lohan to this strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (b.
This is reported by the U.
Here you see "Luckily kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows how Lohan gets out of a car and goes to a possibly homeless family she wants as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees the actress, Lohan follows her parents and children.
She accuses adults of child trafficking.
To all of this, she's not providing any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world sees it right now," Lohan says in the video, following the family along the street.
Apparently, she tries to separate the children from her parents.
Eventually, however, the obviously angry mother seems enough.
Looks like she's turning around and slapping Lohan.
In tears, the actress asserts how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What prompted Lohan to do so is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is said to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander Mascot will stay on Ryugu.

Party Congress of British Conservatives
Sharply guarded - the Tories Congress
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party congress is about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson at the front.
referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a country in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing over the double names for years already.
Now they've agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and the population will vote on this Sunday - whether it is going well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") is Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in Brazil is divided.
Thousands of people went to the streets in several cities to protest the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump Brazil" acts as an anti-system candidate, leading the polls.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned
"The Diesel task force still exists," said Peter Mertens, Chief Development Officer, to the industry journal "Automobile Week".
In December 2017, Audi CEO Rupert Stadler, who was imprisoned and on leave, announced that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"All engine/gear combinations are expected to be tested in the first quarter of 2018, he said.
Mertens said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in addressing the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The taskforce was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi's parent Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car maker had made "serious organizational changes" so that such a scandal never occurred again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and will continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi chief of having authorised the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust gas values after they become aware of the fraud.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Bram Schot currently heads the company as acting CEO.
Due to the switch to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP there were production failures at Audi, said Schot the "Heilbronner Voice".
In principle, he sees a declining demand for saloons such as Audi models A6, A7 and A8, produced in Neckarsulm.
"This segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot puts his trust in electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, 15,000 reservations are already available.
Grindel strives for re-election - Lahm to join the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run for office as DFB President again next year, despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup event and the Özil affair.
"I do my job.
You have to try again and again to re-election, I will.
And then you have to look if the support is there.
The head of the association would find it "notable" in his own words if he did not "want to work on the future project" after the match for the 2024 European Championship.
Grindel has been the head of the association since April 2016 as the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, who fell over the summer tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected to a full term of three years.
The next vote will take place at the German Federal Day on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM leader Philipp Lahm will work in the DFB Bureau.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would continue to advise the Bureau in this role and then, of course, be warmly invited to provide his experience on sporting issues," said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB boss.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a national player without a migrant background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, this office is held by the Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic who have family roots in Cameroon.
"If one without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says that "the issue is important, we have to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local associations where integration must work," said Grindel.

Basketball Bundesliga: Clear opening successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin started with a clear victory in the new season of the Bundesliga.
Against Science City Jena, the vice champion easily won 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing match over 40 minutes.
New addition Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer in Berlin with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counter) from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators at his official debut.
Ex-master Brose Bamberg won with 84:80 (39:37) at S.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni came to 14 meters.

New national player Karim Jallow was best shot by coach John Patrick with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg began the new season with a clear success.
The Basketball Löwen Braunschweig had a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new gamemaker Will Cummings dominated the Oldenburgers with 25 points.
The Braunschweigers, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the Baskets quickly ensured clear conditions.
Erdoğan inaugurates mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Critics of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite German supporters of the Gülen movement and take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens wherever they live.
We will not allow Sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, Cologne city centre was partially closed.
Several thousand policemen were in action - including snipers.
The Islamic Association Ditib is in criticism because it is regarded as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music vs.
Musicians like Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have promoted more commitment to fighting poverty and disease at a joint concert at Central Park in New York City.
"Commit wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night in front of around 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B performed in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I sweat, but it's okay, 'cause I am here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and relief organizations also appeared on stage during the multi-hour spectacle.
In between, however, there was a scare second, when many spectators thought that the sound of a falling metal barrier was gunshot, scared and tried to escape.
Panic came short, people ran into confusion.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed people down from the stage.
"No one tries to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Those who wanted to get one had to read and spread texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and diseases on the internet.
For the numerous musicians and actors there was cheer and applause from the audience - shouts for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
Although he spoke together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake in the U.
At least three women have filed abuse charges up to the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he rejects.

"You can also meet me in an elevator at any time," Flake said to the crowd at the New York concert.
Freedom of the press: German government defends the dismissal of the journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the dismissal of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
In the chancellor's office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had overlaid a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists".
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was about interrupting the press conference.
The journalist's action had caused a serious disturbance, which was unacceptable.
He had arranged for personal protectors to take the man out.
Seibert said that it is not allowed to demonstrate political concerns during press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This is completely independent of whether or not it is a legitimate concern.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah Gulf Movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt of 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are threatened with imprisonment for several decades.
Foreign journalists are also not certain of the Turkish authorities: the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested in early September.
Most recently, the cases of the detained journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a sensation.
Although they came free and could return to Germany, there are still trials in Turkey against them.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him as fresh and handsome: Florian David Fitz.
One has to look twice: Yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for happy conversations at the counter of the Hamburg harbour bar "Schellfishposten".
Moderator Ina Müller meets with her guests some beer, some wine or even higher-percent drinks to loosen the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also take courage for the obligatory singing.
On Friday another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time the actor Florian David Fitz is known from movies like "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Hottest Day".
The Municher got the trip to the far north but not well.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely crushed on it, his eyes only two small slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he isn't ill, he only has a powerful hangover.
Addressing his fans, he posted some - probably not very serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER goes to Inas Night.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And spray.
And the round of egg liqueurs that Ina throws at 6:30, let go of it, too.
The 43-year-old truly faces alcohol consumption.
His fans posted a few tips to fight afterlife.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - probably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
It is not known how Ina Müller survived the nightly drinking.
Since she moderates the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more proven...
To a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and treason
The entry into the 36-kilometre long railway cycle path in Red Riding Hoodland in Treysa is difficult to find and waste.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are sought, but solutions hardly emerge.
Shards, cigarette dumps, garbage and debris, demolished trash cans and now dismantled signposts - this is how the entrance with seating group to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has long been presented.
For the flagship railway bike trail in Red Riding Hoodland a more than infamous sight.
The topic has been occupied by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, according to Ulrich Wüstenhagen's bicycle traffic officer.
The problem had already been raised in the Cycling Advisory Council.
There is no solution yet.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to regular emptying of waste containers and cleaning of surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the imperative of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reported that the topic was also included in the local council.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place to celebrate on weekends.
Not only is it often loud, the situation is also destroyed: posts torn from the ground, trash cans demolished, signs bent around, seat furniture smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are angry that the resting place on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for drinking.
"The focus here is clearly on the Haaße hill along the entire cycle path," confirms the bicycle traffic officer, who is now also worried about the new cycle centre in Ziegenhain, which is opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "Perhaps this sets the threshold significantly higher to attack common property.
This would assume, however, that a police patrol will pass in a timely manner.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaße hill.
He needed to be made more attractive.
One could be very satisfied with the frequenting of the cycle path so far.
Tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high compared to others in Germany," says ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger, ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in Asheroder Straße in Treysa.
There's no turning trail on the hill.
In case of heavy traffic it can happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between the traffic flow on both sides", she explains.
This is no problem for sporty drivers, but it is for older people and especially children.
Music Contest in the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call for a music contest was a success, creative and together.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hilstrup, in the "Music contest for big and small young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family affair with coffee and cakes from the volunteers of the cultural station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long Albanian living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and Zwarties.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We haven't seen this in other districts.
To what did the copywriters look connected?
Lake Hiltruper and the market avenue were particularly frequently mentioned in the villages.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his hit song.
The Kulturbahnhof was also honored.
Again and again it was about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short breaks with short interviews with the interpreters or hints about her work.
Humberg learned that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also taught guitar.
Franke knew from the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a large event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has meanwhile placed everything on YouTube.
"This is not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
For the favourites of the jury there was nevertheless something special - so that others can listen to their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record a complete CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Hemig with his Hiltrup hit, which particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tolle.
Like all of them, the children performed again for the finale - and even sounded "properly good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, relation to Hiltrup, catchiness of melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund and Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive launched the event on the occasion of its tenth anniversary.
She considered the event a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The Word Game: "Decrypto" in Game Test
The players form two teams facing each other.
For each page there is a visual screen, in which four maps with keywords, which you can decipher - the old trick with the red slide - only after you put them into it.
This ensures that the opposite side cannot read anything by mistake.
For example, the maps read from left to right: "1.
2nd window.
3rd cube.
4th Festival.
These are the concepts that need to be encrypted from the beginning.
Because here we should not guess the terms, but codes.
One player per team alternates is the encryptor.
He gets a code card that might say 3.4.2.
In "Decrypto" they should not guess the terms behind the cover, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "cure", "fix" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not as much as possible; because the game wins if he manages to crack the code twice.
So the encryptor notes and reads aloud: "Throw" for the cubes, "Lose" as a contrast to Fest; here, of course, something like "party" would be possible and "Prague" because he paid attention at school and knows the window crash there.
So it goes round by round, team by team.
One does not know the concepts of the opposite side - but this can be better combined with any hint the encryptor gives there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too crazy, the descriptions should be, or you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic to "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players probably have to study it for quite a long time until they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.
But once you get started, you'll be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
But overall "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as predecessors and genre primus "Codenames", which is also an agent theme for a game of less words, but much better to play in small groups.
To whom it is only about guessing and not about victory points, can also easily invent a version for two to do so.
Kulmbach: Man shows Hitler salute and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach twice on Saturday night to Sunday.
He first showed Hitler's greetings in the Upper Town of a passing police patrol, later he also appeared in a bar in the upper town when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholized by the police, he had to spend the night in the detention cell at the Kulmbach police inspection.
He has to be responsible for the use of signs of unconstitutional organisations in a sober state.
Pressig factory was home to the Schubloks
The railway depot in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
A piece of railway history ended in 1991.
"When buffers popped on buffers, you heard it all over Pressig", remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That wasn't bothering anyone.
The brakes squealed and gnawed the wagons.
That was a train.
Statements that symbolize Dinkel's homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen mountain route to the north, which after an ascent of about 220 meters has its peak in Steinbach am Wald.
To cope with this, train and thrust locomotives used to be needed in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprentice workshops, cabling and railway workshops.
"The heartpiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years professional railway operator.
The Pressig railway depot, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - northern half.
On 15.
The electrification of the 1939 line already minimized the need for train and thrust locomotives.
From 1977, they were only used on freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10 000 weights were still placed each month.
In 1982, parts of the factory were demolished, and in 1991 the rest were demolished.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that we have not considered a better use of the site, also in terms of freight transport".
On Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig for the anniversary "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later the end.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressig marshalling station was history.
"The shunters and inhibitors did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen led for the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures are here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with opening success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have finished second in the tennis tournament in Beijing as before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French Kristina Mladenovic.
Next opponent of the world ranking third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kasachsten or Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina when the Russian at number 13 abandoned.
The swäbin now gets to do it with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition in Mittelehrenbach was opened on the weekend as part of the series "Art and pleasure".
With great ease registered organizers and visitors looked the ideal weather when the special vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open area of the estate Dahlmann Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourist association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Art and pleasure".
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
The fascination of the exhibition was greatly appreciated by visitors.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Host Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann greeted the artists at the opening of the opening ceremony.
He's been there since the first hour.
Just like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
But Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer he put his task into proven, young hands with good future prospects.
Both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists in the past and have helped shape flyers.
This year again, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there is a 70 cent special stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased to receive the high support of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical frame.
When walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and expresses it playfully.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with color accents.
Already at the entrance of the property awaits the visitor on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightened in colour, playfully equipped with 20 windwheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes as sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bushwork in the background, the object appears fairy tale-like and invites to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers three-dimensional letters dedicated to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts moving in the wind.
Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy formation of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The topic "Windspiel-Performance" to stroll through the versatile art exhibition.
Until 31 December 2018, the special exhibition can be visited.
50 years of MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - that was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And the Albanians aired their displeasure at that time.
Five of them, at least.
They did not want to accept that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no sangesleben in the district.
It has now become a legend: At a bench in the Tinnenbusch they raised the MGV 68 Albachten from baptism.
It was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Meeting".
"It will be full today," assumed Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albanian singers.
They had revived the anniversary themselves.
For years it was tradition, then there was a pause.
On time for the 50th anniversary, the festival was back.
An elegant ball it became, festive clothes had been asked before.
The guests did not sit in rows in the "House of Meeting" as usual, but at tables.
In between, movement was required: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln attracted the regulators and asked for the dance floor.
It is a matter of honour that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten sound the voice themselves.
Matching the occasion were cheerful songs.
Almost put it: "A day as beautiful as today".
Matching the exquisite grape juice that many had in store, there was the "Rüdesheim wine".
In allusion to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus", which is the Latin term for "hops".
Richard Homann, who was one of the five at the time in the Tinnenbusch, was once again sovereign.
"It is simply fun to sing under his direction," said Holstiege: "He has such an easy way, it is a feat he does." By the way, not only men presented themselves singing this time.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes Evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
After all, there was still poetry.
Singer Theo Weber sat at the desk until three in the morning to create his own rhyme.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented soothing poetry.
There was also a great tombola.
The proceeds will finance the children of the Albatros Youth Centre a visit to the Allwetterzoo.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: U.
The ascender marches.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of U.
No trace of shyness or flaws, the independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) vs.
"That wasn't crystal clear, but we already made an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker agreed immediately: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game stopped.

"It's just too soon for that," says Axel Büring, who said:
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd League has an incredibly good level of quality, and so on.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
Heide Keller became a star on the dream ship.
Now she openly talks about the fact that the series could have been co-inflicted with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as Chief Hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "dreamship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018, she left for good.
The series, which made her star, could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with which she married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world alone with a suitcase and many of my admired colleagues noticed me at eye level," says Keller in conversation with the "picture on Sunday".
At first she was always "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dreamship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it that much."
She considers it possible that her husband at that time could have been jealous, but "like many men, Hans also shunned conversations about problems and feelings".
Keller always tried to be the only one for Hans von Borsody "and he did not want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I disguised myself," she explains.
She had always had the feeling that "not being good enough for him.
He saw me as an emancipated woman who I was never really, even though I sometimes appeared bold and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "even though I was afraid that it might go wrong a second time."
The day before the civil wedding, I was sitting in the dressing room howling and wanted to cancel all.
Borsody's marriage also failed.
Why never did it work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller imagined love to be "like in the film at the time.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I have gone far too naively towards love".
The moth, who regularly explores the city's nightlife at the NZZ resort Zurich, has ventured into the ZFF opening party this time.
Our moth is not a moth, but a little light shy.
And the glaring splendour in which a green carpet is immersed on the Sechseläutenplatz blinds him over a fee.
But it's just film festival, more or less famous ones want to bask in the spotlight.
On this late Thursday evening, he torses over the square to ease himself briefly in the Aquaclean WC oasis.
This is the name of the public toilet system sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: The needy institution on the ground floor of a new pavilion makes much effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
But this evening it stinks in the Lord's oasis for some reason to heaven.
So get out of here, over to the other side of the street: invited guests, who have just entertained the opening film "Green Book" at the best level in the cinema next door, celebrate the beginning of the festival with a party at the three-storey warehouse.
Its name fits perfectly to this film festival: The works on display come from the whole globe.
What do you not have to think of in an article about this festival in order not to fall into disguise for its 190 partner companies.
The moth binds a volume around the feelers, which has given him a good fairy, and two bully bouncers actually wave him in generically.
Inside, the invited crowd, they dance far after midnight to live music or let DJ rhythms to which they yell at each other, wash down exquisitely with Cüpli.
In the delicacy shop in the basement oysters are waiting for slurping mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
That's been the case for years, so it seems to work without big losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The moth studies the sign on the escalator: "Take a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If that's two separate instructions, he went into the dress code.
But it's more of a conditional construction and it certainly has saved lives.
In the household goods department upstairs, the poultry tip a cocktail made with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily receive the price for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting that brand for years, is not here that night either.
But a face, known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film, passes by between local celebrities, cash desk and kitchen items.
I don't think his lead actor will be far away.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, with almost sixty, walks through the crowd like a choir boy.
He's not being chatted, not beggared, you're shooting at all.
Especially for this restraint, often misunderstood as clutter, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dances
Coach and ex-football star Diego Maradona is glad about the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2–0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to cumbia rhythms as shown in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member Maradona dances in the yellow jersey, cheered by the players.
On Saturday, the Mexican second league player had defeated the Leones Negros with 2:0.
After the game Maradona called a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old trains the Mexican club since early September.
Handball: League 1: ASV Send to last minute "destroyed on the ground"
Mr.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly over long periods, senders.
Only the initial phase "we've totally slept," the ASV trainer annoyed.
The owners quickly led with 8:1, even the early time out, which Bieletzki had taken, did not at first fruit.
"But then suddenly a jock went through the team," Bieletzki summed up for the second quarter of an hour.
The gap was only two goals for the break.
Especially Sending Bester, Marius Hintze, met again in the phase.
After the change it became even better for visitors.
After 33 minutes David Ernst compared to 15:15, the relay changer led almost consistently.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly soothing three hits (29:26).
And then?
Take the impartials into action.
Bieletzki usually avoids blaming others.
But: The 120-second time penalty Steffen Mühlhoff collected was a joke.
LIT had a good laugh and hit four times until the end - while the decimated ASV failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood well in the back against seven men and kept throwing at the empty goal.
But they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damned victory has to come," said the completely operated Bieletzki.

Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police digs for pieces of bodies
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (Landkreis Hof), the police search for the remains of the woman.
Forces dug up a road near Marxgrün on Saturday.
For this purpose, the pavement and several layers of it were removed, as police and prosecutors shared.
According to new evidence, missing persons may not have been buried far from their place of residence.
The woman has disappeared since November 4, 1986.
The investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court and the Public Prosecutor's Office have been working intensively on the case again.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators encountered an abnormality under the road near Marxgrün using a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained in the smell of human bones, the officials limited the place to a few meters.
The findings of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.

Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, escaped his imminent dismissal as head of the billion dollar company.
He and the US stock exchange supervisor SEC filed an extrajudicial lawsuit over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay 20 million dollars each, and Musk also gives up the office of Chairman for three years, a position similar to that of the German Supervisory Board.
He may remain chief of the board.
In the settlement, which must be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world's well-known manager for fraud in the U.
Musk, who is also in charge of SpaceX, is the public face of the losing electric car pioneer, which is now valued at over $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is not aware of guilt
Musk explained that he had not done anything wrong and was sad and disappointed with the complaint.
He had always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter supporters that he would perhaps take the company off the stock exchange and pay 420 dollars per share, and that the financing was secured.
In total, Tesla would have been valued at 72 billion dollars.
Later Musk rowed back: Tesla remains on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla now has to find an external chairman, hire two independent board members and also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communication, as well as a committee.

"Let's Dance"-Juror Joachim Llambi and wife Ilona separated
Joachim Llambi probably separated from his wife Ilona.
The dance expert has become known through the RTL show "Let's Dance".
After 13 years of marriage Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.
The "Bild am Sonntag" (Bezhal Inhalt) reports on the separation of the well-known moderator and dance expert, citing Llambis lawyer.

Polls: 46 percent don't want Merkel as Chancellor until 2021
After the scrambles of the past weeks, GroKo collects several poll lows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in an interview - Angela Merkel is viewed critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday for the first time nationwide.
In the weekly poll of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by a counter to 17 percent, the SPD scores a point compared to last week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
That is the lowest value for the Union on Sunday.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If the Bundestag elections were held on Sunday, according to Emnid, the governing parties SPD, CDU and CSU would get only 43 percent of the votes together.
As a result, the large coalition has currently lost a majority on the Sunday issue at all major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties come consistently to 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag election they received 53.4 percent together.
The other parties also have a wide range: the AfD, the second largest party in several polls, reaches 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens have 12.5 to 17 percent of votes.
The left is an average of 10 percent, and FDP 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent upwards and downwards depending on the vote share.
But the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also fallen significantly since the 2017 elections.
At present, only 48 percent of citizens find Merkel the right person in the Chancellery, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS revealed.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 percent) currently wants the grand coalition to hold until the next regular Bundestag election in three years, 41 percent for a new election.
A further survey published on Saturday also showed significant losses in popularity for Merkel.
The Germans also judge whether Merkel should again run for the CDU presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, 44 percent against.
Thus, 64 percent of the Union's supporters want candidacy, 35 percent not.
Aushang at Aldi: Price reduced to happiness
Is Aldi becoming Tinder 2.0?
Who says in times of Tinder there are no more romantic acquaintance stories - he should talk about turkey meat at Aldi times.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer short bargain at the Wühltisch or the favorite pudding is still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The app Tinder stands in the reputation of being less a contact but rather a slippery exchange.
We dared the test: How do women react, you don't talk around the bush for long in the first message?
Here's the amazing result.
Rule-right Hollywood Lovestory potential has it then, when the love luck precedes an out-of-the-eye lost and recovered plot.
If the guy also registers at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.
So it is the author of this advertisement in a Aldi branch unknown to us to wish that she will also find her dream man, with whom she briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic putty".
She definitely deserves her Happy End à la Hollywood to believe in the magic of getting to know analogs.

Football: Bezirksliga: Researchers Performance of VfL Wolbeck vs.
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch went to court with his own.
Wortkarg, coach of VfL Wolbeck, retired (inside) to reflect on the lack of commitment on green.
All history.
Meanwhile it runs again on Brandhoveweg.
Taufrischer Beleg is the 1:1 on Sunday vs.
Yeah, I'm very happy with the performance.
"We have narrowed the rooms and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and went to each individual for the game to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes in front waited for balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more games in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his departure (17th), Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38).
Almost it would have been avenged when the SCA hit dangerously in front of the Wolbeck box in minute 41 twice in person by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be master of his profession.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed.
Schroer also came too late for a Thewes entry after 58 minutes.
With the change of Miles Geske Fetsch on the left side missed another fresh cell cure.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbäumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free kick for the hosts 18 meters before the guest housing.

Twenty minutes to get fucking long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew in the 80th minute the leather in the penalty room unfortunately to the hand.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the present (79.

At the landing, there was an accident at the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
Around 2 pm a drama came on Sunday at the airport in Kottingbrunn.
Turbulence occurred during the landing of a helicopter, as the police confirm to oe24.
The heli was caught by a windboe, crashed to the ground and came to a standstill sideways.
The police, rescue and fire department were immediately notified.

Allbright Foundation's report: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards
Only 8 percent of the board members were female on September 1st, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", which was officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and was before the German Press Agency.
"The companies will have to stand up differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them," said Foundation CEO Wiebke Ankersen.
In the U.
The gap makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented in comparison.
It is a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchanges was also due solely to positive impulses among companies in the medium-sized value index (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
At the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women stagnated.
Recently 26 women worked on the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit consistent women again next year - in their own interests", said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signalled that they would not continue to commit themselves to increasing the share of "zero percent" so far.
A different picture emerges with the supervisory boards: As of 1 September, the proportion of women was 30.
"If just as many women were recruited for the board of directors each year, a share of 40 percent would have been reached by 2023," says the report.

Ferrari did 69,000 euros in operating profit with every car sold in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley are strong on every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well into the race with prices of an average of 33,000 to 38.

In Bonn: Emergency car crashes in taxi
An ambulance is badly damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passerby has been fatally injured in a collision with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they must help - best even save human lives.
Such a rescue trip killed a 26-year-old in Bonn.
Bonn - In the collision of an ambulance with a taxi, a 26-year-old pedestrian in Bonn was killed.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were seriously injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the ambulance had crossed a red light with blue light and Martinshorn on Saturday afternoon.
He then met on a crossing with the taxi that drove at Grün.
The doctor's car flung against a traffic pole and a tree after the collision.
He captured the passerby who still died at the scene of the accident.
Emergency car driver and taxi driver seriously injured

Another called emergency doctor tried to do so - but with no success.
The three seriously injured have been taken to hospitals.
The police, in close consultation with the Bonn prosecutor, are investigating who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we are uncomfortable
After the blaming break in the league cup, Manchester United is now also losing in the 7th round of the Premier League, where they play for the club.
Against West Ham United, ManU is subject to 1: 3. The way of defeat is likely to give way to talk.
The 74th minute scene in which the regenerated Marko Arnautovic shot 3:1 for West Ham was symbolic; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford allegedly led the Red Devils back into play.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all the defenders of Manchester stopped, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot by the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative peak of a previously insufficient performance over long distances.
The mood at United's city rival Manchester City is quite different.
The Citizens trained by Mourinho's big competitor Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Hove Albion for an undue 2:0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the outsider's defense for the home team for the first time.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goal scorer, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no more table leader
Three days after the 1–2 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri and Liverpool defeated Chelsea in the Premier League in a 1–1 defeat.
As in the Cup, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.

Mr.
Daniel Sturridge did better with his Schlenzer in the 89th minute.
After the Reds had started the week with a flawless balance, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, due to the remis in the league, the Blues Liverpool fell from the top of the table.
Both Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) also celebrated 2–0 victories in London, just like the city.
However, the Gunners' fans, in which Granit Xhaka played, had to wait until the 81st minute for a success report against the surprise team from Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart buxed Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later, Mesut Özil made the decision with his third win.
Arsenal moved past Watford thanks to his fifth consecutive victory and is now immediately behind the great rival Tottenham in 5th place 5.
The Wolves lost to Southampton for the fifth time in a row and finished eighth.
VW core brand is missing: Paris Motor Show dedicated to diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in exchange for the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic and yet omnipresent: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not let the German car companies go at the industry meeting in Paris.
From next week, they will be showcasing their new products together with competitors from around the world in the French capital.
The diesel doesn't really matter much anymore.
The possible exchange and retrofitting offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, should nevertheless be an important topic at least behind the brilliant scenes of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and have, among other things, their first pure electric models: the Ingolstädter e-tron will be launched at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
Officially, however, both were officially presented.
The iNext from BMW is scheduled to take place only in 2021.
The focus in Paris is the new 3 Series.
This year, more than 250 exhibitors will be present from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software suppliers are present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in a change with the IAA in Frankfurt in each of the two years.
In 2016, more than a million visitors came.
At least 380 people died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi during the severe earthquakes and subsequent tsunami.
Dozens of them still are missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
On Friday, the island had been shaken by two earthquakes.
The first quake had the strength 5,9, the second the strength 7,4.
Communication and transport connections are damaged, causing enormous damage to property.
After the quakes, the tsunami broke over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds of people gathered on the beach for a festival.
There are fears that the number of victims will still be significantly higher.
The figures up to now come only from Palu.
However, many other municipalities are affected - along Sulawesi's west coast.
Around 150 bikers celebrate service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final divine service for motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a help team.
Werdohl - The place in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged on Sunday to motorcyclists.
After all, the final divine service for bikers was on the programme.
Dr.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place on the last Sunday of a month at Haus Nordhelle.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers had gathered there on Sunday to do anything but ordinary worship.
From 10 a.
At first the biker early schoppen was on the program and it could be strengthened with coffee and cake or with a strong curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, participated.
The sermon was given by Fr.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill took care of the musical background.
"Although bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill is more poetically calm," says Fr.
This was certainly a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big celebration: after the apple comes the milk
Borisch was also active on the actual day of action.
She took care of her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated the process from ripe apple to apple juice step by step to his amazed audience.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and had the apples filled in the big funnel.
With a little muscle strength the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how to make a tasty drink.
But they could also look at this important step this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in forms and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces that look a little bit like pastry, layer by layer.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was not so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large container.
But the fugitive farmer also had ready filled specialities.
He opened his treasure box and presented the latest feather white to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly great.
In a cozy atmosphere the parents came into the conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing but also discovered the built bouncy castle for themselves.
Also active of the fugitive comradeship of former soldiers engaged in the festival and invited at some stations to entertaining games.
The Heimatverein will also offer an action day next year.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp stressed, the home house in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of action.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious on the basis of the topic: after all, the milk will be around.
1:4 vs.
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed pros from Hannover 96 and gave them courage.
However, there was not much positive with Eintracht Frankfurt on the 1/4 (0:2) of the last table.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out as a team," said 96-football pro Pirmin Schwegler and pushed after: "Of course this is disappointing, because you always do a lot of things."
Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.
On the other hand, led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated its first home win.
Evan Ocite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.
Croatia's vice-champion of the world, Rebic, was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hesse in his debut and never managed by Hannover's defense.
With his speed and assertiveness, the striker long after the World Cup showed why he is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, loaned by Liverpool FC, stood for the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurter, which began swinging.
Lucas Torró (17th)'s headball on the net of goals brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defenders around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (back).
The management for the householders fell almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Mr.
It was the first Bundesliga match for AJ Auxerre's defender in the summer.
And Frankfurt stopped before the break.
This time Haller fit his storm partner Rebic, who skilfully refueled and left 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance.
In the mid-term Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak imagination of his eleven and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
Although the Niedersachsen played a bit more courageously forward, igniting ideas remained out until shortly before the end, when the follow-up hit succeeded.
The Hesse were much more efficient.
After less than an hour, Rebic started a solo and then laid across De Guzmán, who had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was only for the Frankfurters against overburdened guests, Jovic also met one minute before the end.
Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures there was a good mood at the Oktoberfest in downtown.
The mayor of Munich Dieter Reiter made it to millions at the opening of 185.
Munich Wies'n last week with two hits.
Geisingen: Geisingen Christians celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross on September 14 or Sunday after.
The festive service takes place in the city church, then a procession to the Holy Cross church with the final blessing.
The church is home to the shot Christ, who comes from the 30-year-old war and is said to have shot a Swedish soldier.
Then blood flowed from the gunshot wound.
From this developed a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not finished up to this day, only the altar room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Reverend Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The service was poorly attended despite the importance for the Geisinger parish.
After the divine service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing the church part of the feast ended.
For many years the Catholic church choir has been inviting you to the secular part of the festival in the Catholic parish home.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the town church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows as well as the construction measures that will continue until next year.
After the scaffold has been standing for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual tenders prepared more specifically.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has increased, but more has been found, which was only possible by the appearance by means of scaffolding.
The pedestal plastering work is completed, before winter the natural stone work is to be started and it is hoped that about half of this work will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New residence in Neu-Ulm Münsterblickstraße
The Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new residence for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
That in Münsterblickstraße "a very special house" is now handed over to its destination - all present agreed on the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the residence of Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
St.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former U.
In 2016, the excavators arrived to tear down the house.
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible, so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new residence
Some 4.6 million euros were invested in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction works remained within the planned framework - both in time and financially.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and fireproof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had set up a home with the many specifications that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move without foreign help.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, also said: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its inhabitants who need tools to be mobile".
The comfort and functionality were combined well, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The property in this situation is a real stroke of luck because it can no longer be acquired in the present situation".
Overall, the new dormitory in Münsterblickstraße offers space on almost 1500 square meters for 30 people with disabilities, divided into three residential groups.
Mr.
Germany: Schwesig complains difference between East and West
Berlin - Before the Day of Unity, deputy SPD chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to accept discrimination against East Germans.
There are differences that ache after almost 30 years of unity.
We are not allowed to accept these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the "Tagespiegel am Sonntag".
The goal should remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It was unacceptable that East Germans worked on average longer than people in West Germany, but had 15 percent less salary.
"I cannot explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this pretty dog end the Korean conflict?
The year-old Pungsan hunting dog should smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang presented two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs to South Korean President Moon Jae.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two dogs, about a year old, arrived on Thursday.
They passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to make it easier for the animals to get used to it.
Dogs with thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North announced its friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid September.
Both countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to apply for the 2032 Olympic Games.
Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket propulsion as part of the mutual approach.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this year of remembrance, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in retrospect of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and general director of the Austrian State Archives, puts it quite differently in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" Austria, which will appear on 1 October.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to the actual work - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the grand coalition starting today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have finally not conjured up the "return to substantive work".
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and work, but be it.
If the Federal Government is now ready to devote itself again to its mission - governance - it should not be prevented now with conceptual debates.
Whether Union and SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and embarrassments of the last weeks will probably show Monday.
In the evening the leaders of the governing parties come together to the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to call this round regularly in order to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the dispute.
First of all, however, there are again conflicting issues on the agenda with the diesel retrofits and the immigration law.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get away with exchange awards, while SPD and CDU see manufacturers as obliged to retrofit older diesels.
While a rapprochement has emerged over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the Union and SPD are still far apart in the planned labour migration law.
The SPD demands a stay perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or do training.
The Union is strongly opposed to the shift from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be another dispute between the coalition partners - and how else should it be?
Not equal and equal has joined forces to form the GroKo, but three partners with sometimes very different social images and priorities.
Fight is good.
Without a dispute, a society that is so diverse and sometimes contradictory will not progress.
But in order to be constructive, there must be no uplifting the issue of being or not being for party tactical reasons.
It's still politics, not theatre.
Union and SPD should argue - but always have the reality of life in mind.
What is feasible and beneficial to many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the lane change question can be pragmatically clarified - thus regaining confidence.
Above all, the People's Party must fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in focus
Does the Minister of Labour violate the applicable right of service?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" their legists worked on the social security reform, reported an exuberant social minister at the presentation two weeks ago.
Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger is surprised by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ)'s statement - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament via question.
She assumes that "the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the deployment of her team and in no way to announce violations of applicable service law in front of ongoing cameras".
Nevertheless, she now has questions to be able to "deliver from any suspicion".
Police tear down a street looking for women's bodies
Marxgrün - For a long time the police did not want to say anything about it.
Now there's confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been digged.
The route is closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
Prior to that, the investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was able to limit the relevant spot to a few meters together with his guide in repeated use.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian conservation authority in the area of this street.
For more than a year, prosecutor's office and criminal court have been handling the missing persons case.
Again and again a cycle path was blocked at Marxgrün and investigated with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that Heike's body could have been buried here in the course of the new state road 30 years ago.
Color powder and eggs: riots in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia is the first anniversary.
But there are riots before.
The separatists have not forgotten the police mission of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Just before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and the police have occurred in central Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the supporters of independence with paint powder, among other things, in order to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3,000 police officers from the police units Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues at a rally in the polling stations last year in the illegal referendum.
In the attempt to prevent citizens from voting, violence had also come at that time.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the separatist demonstrations and the central security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
However, some of the 6,000 or so separatists would have tried violently to break the police chain, throwing paint bags and eggs at officials.
Six people were arrested, 24 others were slightly injured, according to the authorities.
Monday is the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to split the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under compulsory administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont escaped into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also went abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other separatist activists remain in custody.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the administration ended.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also insists on the "right to self-determination".
Football: Oberliga Westfalia: Agreed perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split goallessly
Red-white Ahlen continues to step on the spot.
At FC Gütersloh it was only a 0:0 draw.
In front of 438 spectators in Heidewaldstadion, they turned out to be a total perplexity.
The first half was very manageable from the entertainment factor.
Those who preferred to get a beer or a bratwurst could do this without worry.
There was no danger of missing a goal, because there was practically no one.
First shot after half an hour
Mr.
The Ahlener had the best - and in principle only real - opportunity when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling to parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty line.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Stormer Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48.
After a shooting of Matthäus Wieckowicz it was fixed.
Nick Flock (62.
They also put on a Wieckowicz headball (66th) after a corner ball by former figure Tim Manstein.
RWA interim trainer Angelo Daut responded, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.
It did not do anything.
The Ahlener did not bring about more than visual superiority thanks to their own initiative.
Only in 91.
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positive: "I like that we played to zero". But unfortunately the zero also stood in front.
"This time we weren't as dangerous as we were against Holzwickede and even though our opponent didn't want to play along," said RW Ahlens interim coach.
Offensively, "everything was going a little bit" against a team that wanted to defend.
In any case, I didn't feel that we could get a countergate," says Daut.
To his sorrow, however, one did not feel as if his team could score a goal.
The performance was too poor.
Reckenfelder harvest market: Fortunately there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfeld board office, for which these donations are intended, are pleased.
To assure volunteers: "These donations remain in Reckenfeld as well".
At the opening, the sky turned out to be bright blue, but the place was still a bit empty, but that should change during the day.
Because: "It's so pleasant here, so we're here today," said one visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a proper pinch of humor.
For the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be balanced against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in shortly.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "substitute" did not allow itself to entertain musically the ever-increasing visitors.
This came so well that later on some folk songs were sung along.
"Just great," said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to put the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is glad about the many active people with their booths, among them mostly clubs.
"Actually, there should be no such thing as a plaque," he thanked for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of all who were in action at the booths and also included the other festivals and the "Clean up" campaign held in September.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful painting - here something goes.
Then the Maikranz was taken away by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and taken to winter quarters.
Many stalls have been used to promote physical well-being.
From sweet to cardiac everything was available.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative at his decupier saw.
He had veneer works, beer lids with Reckenfeld motifs and more on offer.
Three Reckenfeld beekeepers offered a speciality: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought along by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has a specialty to do with it.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
The little Elsa had to access again and again, so tasted the cake.
It is the conviviality that allowed the visitors to linger for a long time until the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubricating with local political message: No successful advertising for skaters
In Lengerich, unknown people have advertised for the construction of a skate facility in an unlikely way.
In several places, there are corresponding briberies, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration on request of WN.
In at least one case, the police have been sued for damages.
The three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" were written in large letters on signs at the Gempt Hall and Old Town Hall.
Mr.
Since the short message was apparently left "only" with an edding, it could easily be removed.
"A few days later this was there again, this time sprayed," says Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
This particular case gets a special note by the fact that on the board several large companies from Lengerich are also called.
If the skate system is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
According to Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, there are already commitments without mentioning names.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical with those companies on the smeared board.
For years, local politics and administration have been concerned with skatemaking.
After the old LWL clinic had been dismantled, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
The Council finally voted in favour of the fire station.
However, this idea was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a building here.
At the end of June a turnaround followed.
The members of the Main and Financial Committee voted unanimously for the Gutenberg school area.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word will be given to the city council.
It is based on a decision this year so that a positive vote could be made in 2019.
Air traffic control bottleneck is getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement next year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come," said Matthias Maas, head of the air traffic control union, the German press agency before the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
One important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures was the long-known shortage of personnel in European air navigation services, for which there was no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can make rapid improvements for the coming year, but training new pilots takes four to five years," says the trade unionist.
The market for fully trained pilots is empty throughout Europe.
Around a hundred people were missing in Karlsruhe alone to monitor upper German airspace.
Maas again criticized that various aviation unions were not invited to the summit.
On Friday, representatives of the federal, state, air traffic control, airlines and airports meet in the Hanseatic City to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work densification and overtime, it won't work without us," said the head of the GdF, who has many members at German air traffic control.
Maas once again blamed the EU Commission for the pilot misery.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost and personnel savings at national air traffic control services are now fully operational.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to support regulations in Brussels that "do not cut off the air any further".
At present, EU targets would be agreed by 2024 and further tightening would be feared.
The EU is constantly under lobby pressure from airlines.
"Mr.
He hoped that the high delay costs of airlines would lead to a rethink.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Traffic Control (DFS) offers a "consistent training and future pact", says Maas.
The so far announced admission of 120 pilot pupils per year over the next five years is just enough to offset the age-related exits.
The necessary staff building is not yet involved.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted in favour of corporate restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously for the plans to rebuild the company.
Following the wishes of Mr.
Both companies are to be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional reduction in staff beyond the already known reductions in administration.
After two resignations, the control body on the capital side counts only eight heads.
To this end, there are ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is scheduled for a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials Ltd.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business will be bundled with lifts and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence in demonstrations of policemen and Catalan supporters of independence.
Two simultaneous demonstrations of Spanish policemen and Catalan supporters of independence in Barcelona have involved violent clashes with numerous injured.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 policemen from all over Spain gathered on Saturday as well as some 6000 supporters of independence demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protest trains away from each other with a large bid.
However, according to the forces, independence advocates tried repeatedly to break the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officers with paint and gunshots.
According to the reports, there were also ranks between the participants of the various protest movements.
According to rescuers, 24 people were injured.
The police said there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
The police had wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who had taken action almost exactly one year ago against the independence referendum in Catalonia banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez of AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and to celebrate the fact that they hit us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to name Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who have only done their duty last year: to defend the law," he says.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Panne allows access to personal data of British Minister
A security vulnerability in a mobile phone app has led to the temporary access of everyone to the personal data of ministers and members of the Conservative Tory Party on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the breakdown became known one day before Tory Party Day in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
On Sunday morning the police reported a serious traffic accident on the Bundesstraße 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen towards Ronnenberg.
Two people died driving their car against a tree.
The car is currently on fire.
The forces are on site.

Football: Juve coach praises after top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker "played the best game this evening together with the half hour of Valencia", praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensively purchased star was the decisive man in the important game against the pursuer without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and it's good," Allegri said.
Although we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goal templates, Juve shot the game after the early delay by hitting Dries Mertens (10th minute) and depended on the worst chaser for now.
The goal hunter, who was brought from Real Madrid, first put on former Bundesliga pro Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double pack (26th/49th).
And Ronaldo did the preliminary work on the goal by Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who just before the goal line had to push in.
"He gives many models," praised the coach.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goalkeeper in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We need to be even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
Best Juve goal shooter is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in his account.
With Ronaldo's purchase for more than 100 million euros, Juventus' superiority seems even more overwhelming.
Seven victories in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A.

But at the latest after the assignment of Mario Rui (58.
The Portuguese had to climb too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red from the square.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turin coach.

The midfielder also played in the Champions League game against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown off the course in the 2–0 victory of the Turiners and is closed for the home game against Young Boys Bern on Tuesday.
Kanye West changes its name
With a particularly bizarre performance, Rapper Kanye West paid attention to the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" that weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused frowns and questions among the spectators.
The 41-year-old announced a name change on time for the release of his new album.
From now on, you may only call him "ye", the musician says.
"The being formerly known as Kanye West" he tweeted following the late singer Prince when he dropped his stage name.
The pseudonym, however, is not news.
Already the tenth album appeared under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist explained that "ye" had religious significance for him.
"I think "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "you," says the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
We did it!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage did not hide his disappointment.
This was a weak play of ours today.
The opponent was simply more grippy, we have hardly ever confronted him with problems". Accordingly thin reads the list of Hoetmar shooting possibilities.
Gradually two goals in 90 minutes, this rarely makes games positive.

The SG also had only two possibilities in the first run, but the first used Maik Krause from a sharp angle to the early lead (7th).
In 43.
The hosts had only a double opportunity when first Moritz Höne failed at Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and in the margin Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorst Keeper.
After the break the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49.
A commercial meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved his hand on the gate line and saw red for it - also Niklas Eilmann could not use for the guests (75.
Only when Nils Berheide poked the ball over the line was the game decided (81.
"We had criticized each other hard before, which was different today than in recent weeks," said Florian Kraus.

"I don't know what to think," he said.
"We didn't get access to them at all." He probably meant the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green-whites who had a collective offensive.

With understandable mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was by far our best season performance," he says.
"As we return after the 0:2, as we keep against it over the entire season against one of the top teams in the league, that was really phenomenal."
It is all the more bitter that one must now go home empty-handed.
Top goal hunter Lars Zymner brought the hosts with his 12th goal in the lead (24th season).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game to score this goal.
On his left side, he placed the 2–0 for Fabian Fröhning (39th).
We knew that, but a player like that can't be taken out completely.
"That was already insanity what he did," Lewandowski recognized the quality of the opponent enviously.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own elf made the balance: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia gatekeeper Hinkerohe into the long gate (45.
After the change of sides, it was again McGill who scored the balance (59.
Then it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed play.

In spite of a large number, Albersloh was unable to counter the last Concordia hit (80.
We must now focus fully on Wednesday.

But before and after, Wulff was there as a guest.
Thus, Academy Director Udo Hahn reckoned him when he said proudly: "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors were already with us." However, the fact that celebrities always appear at the Academy in Tutzing Castle was also a topic when presenting the annual programme.
At the end of October, singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker takes part in a conference on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective; on September 29, the writer Frido Mann attends a conference about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also agreed: he wants to personally receive the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which he also receives in another category (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid-2019 have it in themselves.
"The pension is not safe!" is in a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria: "Barbarism without limit".
Weapons deals, destruction, torture, death - war ridicules every humane idea."
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to the radical change of work through digitalization.
Academy Director Hahn convinced himself that "free democracy needs places where civil society can come together to seek solutions or at least partial solutions."

Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Both suitable for adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret artist, Teubner preoccupied himself with gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth of heart for the (feeled) woman and the (felt) man and what else there may be but also with music.
The mini-guitar put her in and mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp sat on the wing.
On the one hand, this is the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes to the end of the movement and on the other hand a true pianist: So congenially harmoniously accompanies Süverkrüp Teubner that some might have wanted a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, as it fit the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had brought in a paradox: the satisfaction of the man came if he had a partner but did not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, however, would not benefit.
The piano solo demonstrates this: What would have emerged from Mozart's composition if "the Nannerl" had unexpectedly opened the door?
So Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt full of blood and wounds" to the "Lied vom Tod", and from Mozart G minor symphony into a playful dance.
There was big applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers presented Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, the Chansonette.
But the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not take any additional thanks.
She had the idea of giving the duo performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt as well as one in Wolbeck.

Handball: Women's Landesliga: Ahlener SG keeps the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlener dames had problems with Carolin Stallmann, who only scored ten hits.
"Actually, I was happy with the defense, only one player made too many goals.
We did not get to grips with them," says ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu, who said: "We are not able to control them.
However, he became more angry about the many missed opportunities.
The focus at the end was missing his team this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost until the end a delay, lying at the break with 11:12 and later with 15:18 (45.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of BSV Ostbevern at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball women of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the leading group of the third league West.
At VC Allbau Essen, the blue-and-white team won 3:1.
"It was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the upper third of the league.
We have now worked this out," said coach Dominik Münch, after an almost impeccable performance of his team at the downfall of the table leader.
The first course was dominated by the guests almost as they wished.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went with 25:15 to the vice champion of the previous year.
Food has accepted in the two bars, but has not come into play.
We've been busy with her.
Our opponent struck at high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence the BSV already led with 12:8. "Essen changed the assumption to three bars.
We couldn't hold the impact pressure.
Food sucked up, and we got a bit lulled," Münch continued.
At the 18:17 the volleyball women from the Ruhr area had their first noses in front.
Although Ostbevern defended four set balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt, however, found its goal.
"The game was now a better class," said the instructor to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the BSV turning the leaf from 14:16 to 25:21 in section 3.
Münch: "We played consistently and quietly".
About 7:3 and 15:13 brought the blue and white passage four with 25:22 to their side.
Vera Horstmann was voted the most valuable player, but also Maren Flachmeier had caught an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dirtmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Ros.
International: Turkish municipality: mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) criticized the way in which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
"In the German-Turkish relationship, the mosque opening in Cologne has left behind a heap of pieces that can only be met with difficulty," said Gökay Sofuoglu, Chairman of TGD, the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and German sides had missed the chance to make a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of working side by side with top German politicians to underline Muslims' belonging to Germany, Erdogan has used the appointment for his purposes," Sofuoglu complained.
The extensive exclusion of the German public had "strengthened many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already established itself
After the long summer break is finally Folktreff time again.
At 7.30 p.
Almost to the day exactly it is then a year ago that we had a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln."
I didn't think our folk meeting would be so fast in Nottuln.
No matter if Sturmtief Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace of Amtmannei was always full.
"As always, the program at the next Folktreff is a colourful mixture of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who invites friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer agreed to the first Folktreff "birthday" with his accordion.
He was a member of "Gaitling", a group from Steinfurt, who played music with flat German lyrics for many years.
Now he's with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folktreff remember the last event in the summer when Christoph Schulz from the Volkstreff Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frösche in der Nacht" enthusiastically sent the listeners home with an earworm.
"We expect many happy guests to spend a social and humorous evening again", says the invitation of the home club.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to participate actively is invited to participate.
Since the coveted seats are always fast, it is recommended to be there early enough.
The Folktreff begins at 7.30 pm, but admission is already at 7 pm.

From pure fruit to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.
On 29 Sept.
Of course, he was called "Kulmbach City and Land District Fruit Building Association" by mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association also differed from today's work - it was actually pure about fruit-making, no one thought about flowers and horticulture at the time.
"At that time, in the Enlightenment era, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said Dr.
Orchards were to line highways, so-called industrial gardens were built at schools, and they were to be used in schools.
The 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members, are still responsible for fruit growing.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an equally important role as knowledge transfer, healthy nutrition and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwürfe" showed how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are on stage.
"The youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said district chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed how important nature experiences are for life.
The collection of chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that with Smartphone & Co.
To celebrate the anniversary, Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Klaus Peter Söllner.
"Where they should stand, the district association decides", added Landrat Söllner and emphasized the special importance of horticultural associations for villages.
The county association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district did not leave any doubt about this, even district manager and consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors through the long history of the Kreisverband and reported among other things on the necessity of self-sufficiency after war.
Everything used to come out of the garden, it was fed for winter.
In the late 1950s, however, the garden turned into a decorative and residential garden.
"Nature has survived, it was already there before us and we need to orient ourselves to it", argued the expert for fruit and nut trees.
That is why there is an incentive for horticultural associations not to slow down so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
This includes welcoming the new citizens to our associations, added Wolfram Vaitl, President of the Bavarian Federation.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren", Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the towerwinds of the Thurnau Music Association.

Priority to Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister moves UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: they provide both trading partners with an ultimate solution.

protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro was injured in a stabbing attack.
According to a report by the daily newspaper "O Globo", the extreme right ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro where he lives.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will be making public appearances in the South American country last week before the presidential elections.
The politician had been attacked on the open road during an election campaign in South Brazil in early September.
Meanwhile, thousands of people in several Brazilian towns took to the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht") women's associations had above all called for protests against the former military.
Also in the social networks the associations mobilized racist and misogynistic statements against Bolsonaro.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers Party, Fernando Haddad.
He was replaced by former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who was sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to run for office.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As ex-mayor of the city of São Paulo, Haddad was far behind the far right candidate Bolsonaro in surveys.
Although the "Trump Brazils" has long been involved in politics, it has recently become an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reaches the absolute majority in the first round of the election, there will be a final vote on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from this success - no matter who he fights.
Bolsonaro is known to be instigating homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He is shocked with verbal derailments over and over again.
Another time, he said that Lula's left-wing workers' party was to be shot.

After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen's dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen shared on Larsens website.
Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children on his deathbed.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become familiar with the band Gasolin', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Their songs were influenced by international music stars like Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
Larsen was successful as a solo artist after the dissolution in 1978.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is the most sold album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen on Sunday in a statement as "street boy" who was "against everything but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had performed on the 70th birthday of Queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rocknacht in the shoe factory: volume at compressed air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger". The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a description of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: Hardrock pure of three friends.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert starts, the musicians even take some time for a group photo.
There's no sign of stage fright.
Afterwards the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands loudly inspire the around 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito".
The quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika already knows how to convince at the beginning of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from his own pen and the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage the band dances to the harmonious and powerful interplay of the band.
Although "addition" calls cannot be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
Guitarist Sascha Bregenzorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate that hard rock is not just hard rock with their alternative sounds reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" a synthesizer is used in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only the longing, almost balladish "Take Me Home" captivates by changing from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of complex songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen, however, has gained a special degree of fame since its foundation in 2005.
Full of agility, the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with its performances in front of a huge audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China - is obvious and inconceivable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann sets his own accents in conjunction with the band with the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
For the sound that feels even higher than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a cheered solo while he runs through the audience.
A certain volume is of course part of the genre at such a hard rock concert: At the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the mixing console team, the three-piece concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is 98 decibels.
This is for example at compressed air hammer level, but is thus still well below the controls of the "Wacken Fesitval", to which "The Ignition" on their website point.
However, the Ahlener audience does not need 120 decibels in jet drive volume as usual with the annual Metal-Stelledichein in the north of the Republic.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gangart have long since convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, took the bone saw and set off a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups, of course in the figurative sense, say in the end.
And to enjoy above all the big applause of the visitors.

Trump adores Kim: "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that the US President of North Korea's leader Kim is quite well disposed despite the nuclear crisis.

The Tragic: It's a long-distance relationship.
Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old offspring of the ruling dynasty of Pyongyang, although in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament proves to be quite tough fragments.
"I was tough, so was he, and we went back and forth," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversation with Kim would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, great letters.
Her personal connection had also borne political fruit: Trump referred to Kim's announced stop of all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics have seen little more than lip service behind it.
It seemed to the U.
In any case, he anticipated the expected criticism of this at his appearance in a large sports hall in Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they fell in love."
How terrible, how dreadful is that?
This is so unpresidial.
But he cares very little, Trump explained and then pointed his index finger at the crowd: "I have always told you it is so easy to be presidential."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there pushing into this crowded arena, but we would only have 200 people outside.

Refugees Saved from Libyan Prison Video
Nigerian refugees used a mobile phone video to point out their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya and thus enable their rescue.
The group had filmed the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Savija in July under life risk and distributed it online.
"You are refusing to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flew out to Nigeria in late August.
"Without the video, we probably couldn't have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video to AFP.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya trying to reach Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video he brought himself to life according to his own statement.
One of his fellow fighters had been beaten almost to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
Generally, the detention conditions were catastrophic: "They all beat us with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back to their homes this year using the program, said IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of Nigerians who have now been rescued is not unusual in view of the poor conditions in Libya.
But he has not heard of a call for help via mobile video.
International organizations have long criticized the situation in Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants from Africa to Europe.

German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old woman had to wait several days and nights in his car in a forest area in Middle Franconia after he had stuck the car off all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue forces discovered the car on Saturday afternoon, not far from a pasture, and rescued the missing since Tuesday evening, the police reported on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a ride with his SUV across the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive search, the man's whereabouts remained unclear for days.
Laschet warns the rule of law in Turkey
To the contrary, the President of North Rhine-Westphalia Armin Laschet (CDU) called for the rule of law in Turkey in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed," said Laschet on Saturday after meeting Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This mainly concerns the waves of arrest, press and religious freedom.
He had therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to become normal in the future, if economic relations should be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this."
According to Laschet, the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey were also addressed.
He had formulated the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
He then reiterated the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved at short notice to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence at Cologne Airport.
Originally it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the castle owners rejected this out of political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan travelled on to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne after the conversation.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said: "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also its contact - and not the Turkish President.
No trust in the US: North Korea demands disarmament
While US President Trump is not tired of stressing the success of the negotiations on the denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri demands Washington's approval.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused the U.
"The recent standstill comes because the US is building on coercive measures that are deadly to confidence building," said Ri in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any trust in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," said the North Korean chief diplomat.
The fact that sanctions could force North Korea on the knee is "a dream of people who do not know us".
However, in order to build trust, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri emphasized.
From the US side, however, there were no "equivalent reactions", the minister criticized.
Due to North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council decided three times last year alone to sanction the internationally isolated country.
US President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have been urging the United Nations to adhere strictly to sanctions in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working towards convergence.
Trump first met North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un in June.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President aims for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will return to Pyongyang for talks on ending the North Korean nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
That they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing of it: White blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a large buffet waited for the guests after Thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had enchanted the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank the meal.
The start with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, head of HoT, recalls.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the nasty surprise: a power failure had put the huge, two-part fridge out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of for the rest of the day.
"Now we had to start over again: we had a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to make it alone," Westbuer says.
And so everyone got involved.
The result could be seen, the guests were thrilled.
"Better cooks can't," praised one visitor, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests could use quiche, liver cheese or cakes.
"It's really great what the children and young people put on their feet," Fr.
Jürgen Sator leaves the state executive board NRW of the board
Out of frustration about criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has given up his position in the Landesverband (Landesverband) out of frustration.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essen table had introduced a stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as Vice-Chief of the NRW panels, said Sartor of the "World on Sunday".
Too many fell in my back.
Prof.
Sartor had taken the sharp criticism.
"I can understand his step - people who didn't know exactly why the Essen table was doing that have said so."
Sartor is still active for the Essen board - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
Sartor again criticized colleagues from other boards in the "world on Sunday".
One should not take the approach, "without us people in town starve to death".
It was the task of the state to ensure that people did not starve.
The Essener did not attend a congress on Friday in Berlin.
"I am told too much sweet cuddly", he said.
There are all these social fuzzi that criticized me that way.

VfB Stuttgart was also the first victory.
Due to a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, Werder Bremen had to fear in the meantime.

Macedonians are voting on new state names
In Macedonia today, some 1.8 million citizens vote to change their country's name to North Macedonia.
With a yes, the almost three decades of simmering conflict with neighbour Greece could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name and had blocked Macedonia's approach to the West.
The voters therefore also decide on future Western integration.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member if the referendum was positive.

He had also trampled the trio on his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered haematoma, bruises and concussion.
The asylum seeker was also severely injured "for reasons unknown", as the police said.
He has been taken to the hospital and monitored throughout treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two of them gave their say on Saturday in Hamburg.
Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper that a registered partnership had not been considered for her.
"If we get married, then right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
Dr.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs caused a stir with a speech of anger on June 30, 2017.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "tolling" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in allusion to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Shabowski.
Since the 1.
Previously, they had been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, e.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work before the members of the Bürgervereinigung Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprosy.
About 400 meters hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went on for around twelve supporters.
"We are doing this to reduce costs," said Walter Schröer, chairman of the civil association.
And it has accumulated a lot.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time, but fortunately it is only a shape cut.
Already in spring the hedge had been shaved.
The breakfast that follows the work has a long tradition.
"Everybody should be strong," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner fetches gold at the Canoeslalom World Cup
The Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the conclusion of the canoe slalom world championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old put a perfect run on the Olympic circuit on Sunday.

I was well prepared, had already had enough rides here on the facility and it was all right today," said the London 2012 Olympic third.
In the finish, he threw away his paddle with joy and raised both arms in a winning position - knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
At least he had starting number four.
But the six remaining starters could not beat his fable time of 89.

The police inspection Gauting reported the first attempt to break into a family house this fall.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - that is what intruders want to take advantage of.
The police inspection yesterday reported the first attempt to break in this autumn.
The alarm system is due to the fact that it remained in the attempt at the family house on Königswieser Straße.
It started when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday before 8 p.
The intruders knew that the inhabitants were not at home.
The alarm system, however, apparently surprised her to such an extent that she took the flight without prey.

Broke at Hertha: Catched up with the reality: Bayern challenged Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin does not want to be "fallen".
The next two classics vs.
The first small performance-delle under the new coach Niko Kovac is not intended to increase to the greater autumn low for Munich.
"A week ago they still felt we were invincible.
Now we have a little bit of reality," said Thomas Müller after the deserved 0-2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this is really annoying and that's why we're gasping towards Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year no goal was scored, like at the same time of the preseason two compulsory games in series without victory, the championship lead in the Bundesliga lost for the time being to Borussia Dortmund, who won the league.
Although the overall situation is far from as dramatic as at the end of the failed Carlo Ancelotti in late September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its running-intensive man-against-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful pin-stitches over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, just as the last overpowering Bavaria is to crack.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we won't let this happen and we will do everything we can to be successful again," Kovac emphasized.
Otherwise, however, he dealt surprisingly gently with his losers in his hometown and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only for the once again flawed handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim conclusion of his term positive before the national game break - otherwise the tone should probably worsen.
Kovac did not take any exceptional action at Benfica Lisbon before this season's second top-class appearance after 2:0.
After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation for the second pre-round match against Ajax starts as planned, which had also defeated AEK Athens with 3-0 at the start.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also make our goals again," announced team captain Manuel Neuer.
Like after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place Joshua Kimmich spoke clearly.
The defender acted in the role of Mahner.
"I don't think this is all bad luck, we have to work it out again, because we do not make the multitude of chances and make the mistakes in the back," emphasized the 23-year-old just before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bayern were already five points behind Dortmund, which has now taken the lead again with a point advantage.
And so Kimmich rated with a wink at least positively that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now ended.
"Yes, that's good," the national player said.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in shot line: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack from Erdogan on Grindel
Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany with serious charges.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the union line.
Now a new post will be created.
Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought on different stages for interpretation in the permanent dispute topic Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president strongly criticised the handling of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the DFB boss defended the association line.
In the early Sunday morning, the Grindel personally attacked by Özil in the Mainz ZDF "Sports Studio" announced consequences from the causa.
"In the future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U-teams - we have to draw very precise conclusions that this is not repeated," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migrant background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel once again stated that Erdogan does not represent the values of football and DFB.
In sharp words, he had denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they had to take pictures with me in England," Erdogan said on Saturday in Domstadt.
To be honest, as your president, I couldn't digest the fact that our two young men who rose to the German national team were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which had begun with Erdogan through photos of them.
At the same time, he announced that he would want to face players in the future, but he did not want to play.
That someone says: If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I am a migrant - I cannot.
"I regret the fact that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We had to defend Mesut more, I always said.
He does not see a basis for Özil's return to the national team either.
In addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration officer will be appointed as the conclusion.
"If one without a migrant background is to have a clear impact on society and football and says: "The issue is important, we have to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local associations where integration must work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to run for office as DFB president again next year.
"I do my job.
year old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As reported by the police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents between 10 a.
At first, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic light in the Lauter Höhe area.
She told the pensioner that he had been driving against their car.
However, there was no exchange of personal data because the 75-year-old couldn't find the lady in the car park any more.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a driver who had left the road and hit a lead post.
In response, the man did not want a police station and then drove away.
Then the Rödentaler went home.
However, the pensioner has moved to his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, and hit a construction vehicle at the turn.
Finally, the police could find him and stop.
His car had serious accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and could not remember much.
The damage is approximately 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Almost 1000 still in operation.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the moor fire on a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 troops are still engaged in the extinguishing work.
The Bundeswehr announced this on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop stable, 70 volunteers were recently withdrawn.
A further reduction is planned.
On the night of Sunday, an above-ground fire was discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster had been resolved, which was proclaimed a week earlier on September 21 because it was feared that the flames would endanger adjacent forests and settlements by wind and spark flight.
On Thursday it was said that an attack of the fire on adjacent communities no longer threatened.
At times, more than 1500 local forces tried to control the big fire.
The Luftwaffe further supports the work on the Bundeswehr test site at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones from the Bundeswehr.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are planned for October 2 and 5.
The fire had been triggered by test rockets fired by Airbus engineers.
The smoke flag of the moorfire had occasionally moved up to a hundred kilometers across the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr intends to set up a contact point for the reception of reports of damage.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.

Referendum in Macedonia on new names begun
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan country began.
Around 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in future.
Due to its northern province of the same name, it is adjacent to Greece.
As a means of pressure, Athens has blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO for nearly three decades.
If the citizens vote in favour, they also give the start to their country's western integration.

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is designed to make organ donation easier and relieve the burden on relatives in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can still be removed only with express consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donations and relieve relatives in stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in case of death can register there.
Your wishes are then available if required by Swisstransplant.
The new procedure does not change the fact that, as in Germany, organs can only be removed with explicit consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only five percent of the cases find a card at the crucial moment in possible donors.
In over 60 percent of the conversations, the family does not know the deceased's wish.
"They then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Ever.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as Marita Völker-Albert says.
"There is no register in which people can register their wishes - per or contra organ donation", she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has advocated a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be considered as an organ donor, unless he or she disagreed with him or her family.
The Catholic Church, among other things, rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in head calculation

Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, announced on Sunday.
Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74 year-old pensioner from France, as main arbitrator Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were: 14.
Since viewers were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon where participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Mr.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from over 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greetings were present in Bielefeld two years ago when he was 14 years old.
With terms like superbrain, genius or prodigy, organizer Laue can do little.
"Headcounting can be trained," he said.
Many people practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore there are even stadium-oriented computing competitions.
For example, the disciplines include drawing square root from six digits.
When calculating versatility, candidates get surprise tasks for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
The Germans would also have good chances here, said the main judge.
Otherwise, Asians are often in advantage because they learn to calculate their heads more intensively and with other effective methods in early childhood.
Urgent Appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early detection

Polar cold air brings fresh snow on the mountains in the west
Mrs Holle shakes out her beds in the west for the first time next week: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it can snow down to approx.
From Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimeters of fresh snow is expected above 2,000 meters.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions become wintery.
Farmers are allowed to begin on Monday with the annual Knickpflege
Schleswig-Holstein farmers are allowed to start their annual kink care on Monday.
The "green ramparts" that are unique in Germany have shaped the landscape of the low-forest state for about 200 years.
The tree and bushes are up to five metres wide and the last retreat areas for many animals and plants.
Knicks connect habitats scattered as corridors, over which the exchange of organisms can still work, as said Ingo Ludwichowski, Managing Director of the Nature Conservation Association (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein.
Knick's are living fences
The Knicks were created by an order of the Dane King Christian VI in 1766, which ruled Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limits and cattle fences, they also supplied firewood and beams for their timber houses.
His name "Knick" also dates from that time: by "knicking" the branches could develop dense, intertwined boundaries.
Today, some 45 000 kilometres of hedges extend between the north and the Baltic Sea and give the image of a woody, diversely structured landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used by around 7000 animal species as a substitute habitat.
Up to 1800 different species could live in one kilometer of kink and breed up to 30 birds.
However, the kink can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is maintained in winter.
Otherwise, he becomes a light row of trees, which in addition to biodiversity also loses the wind protection effect, says Ludwichovsky.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, knick care may only be operated outside the breeding period from October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about situation on site
In an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND), Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you there during the tsunami yourself?
No, I was on the island of Java at the time in Jakarta.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I heard about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, as the airport in Palu was closed at the time of the flight.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" has also been destroyed, but we have temporarily arranged something where we have accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run on surrounding hills, where they still endure in fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water and food.
Some stay in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and gasoline.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison was also destroyed, the prisoners run around freely and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not been found and are missing.
How is communication and information on the island going?
Right now we have cell phone reception, but it didn't work before and we only got information on the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors, and other people they don't know if they are alive and where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but at work for example.
The tsunami warning system has not worked properly.
Do you have any information?
We don't know the reasons, but when the warning came, many thought, "Okay, no tsunami," and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran into the surrounding mountains, and that the tsunami hit them.
Is not an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes, and we also train evacuations and evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit many people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB must long renounce Aogo and Donis
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing the VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for some time.
At 2:1 against Werder Bremen, Aogo had contracted a muscle fiber crack in the rear left thigh on Saturday, the football club announced on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle tear in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games even after the following break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not provide a forecast of downtime.
A muscle bundle tear usually heals within six to eight weeks, and a muscle fiber crack heals more quickly.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebastian Film Festival

However, the action lasted for some time.
Even a boat came in.
Olching - Walkers at Lake Olchingen on Sunday morning noticed a white, injured duck.
She stayed in the water station.
To help the animal, the passers-by called the police and the fire department, and the police arrived.

Despite the injury, she was able to avoid the forces again and again.
At the end she escaped to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade was able to encircle the animal and push it back on land, where after almost an hour it was put into a transport box by a fireman with a courageous grip.
The duck injured in the breast was subsequently taken to the animal clinic of the LMU in Oberschleißheim.
But according to the first estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI Turbospeed Investigation
Time is extremely short and the number of interviews planned is very limited.
With a turbo-tempo FBI investigation, Republicans in the U.
President Donald Trump has given investigators a deadline until Friday to clarify the alleged incidents more than 30 years ago.
The recent turn in the drama about Kavanaugh's vocation, accompanied by a cultural struggle, was triggered Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing with Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in whose course the lawyer launched angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Justice Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge at the U.
However, the majority of Republicans seemed secure when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared against his original announcement that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultous scenes his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had described the heavy reproaches on Thursday as "shit," initially abstained from further attacks against women and, on the contrary, spoke of "happy luck in misfortune."
That way, he said, final doubts could be removed.
Later, at an election rally, Trump sharply attacked the Democrats because they reject Kavanaugh: "They try to block and destroy."
Trump orders FBI investigation in the Kavanaugh case
The White House has also severely reduced the powers of investigators.

FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: One felt the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, time played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I saw every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty room," said the sports executive at Schalke 04 - and breathed up.
After all, the royal blues still managed to get the close 1:0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first win of the season under control.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11th of the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco had given Tedesco safety: "In total, the first half was good, both playful and from pressing", the head obviously played an increasing role with increasing playing time.
Don't actually create a headball monster
To me, the last ten minutes felt like two hours," Heidel said, "if the team was half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore keep retreating.
And defended against Mainz with man and mouse.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all had a huge stone fell from our hearts," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant part in it with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in the man made."
But in the end only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course with Tedesco.
"We wanted to start impressively in the initial phase and make a fireworks display," said Schalke's chief coach.
Victory was important.
Finally, we can enjoy a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played smart, quiet and brave, so we have to play games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest drawback of the afternoon: King Blue missed it, rather to worry for clearer conditions.
The possibilities were finally there, e.
"Then it wouldn't have been a trembling victory," Tedesco said: "You have already felt the fear a bit."
So I'm happy we won.
He wasn't the only Schalker.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in Leitzachtal 2 km visible

Prof.
Before them stands the author, Professor Dr.
He has repeatedly followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"For many years I have been working to bring interesting people to Greven," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the "Kulturpolitik" alliance in the evening orientation.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very easily, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject clearly.
With a lot of gestures, tangible numbers and one or another joke, he brings one of the most conflicting topics closer to the listeners: migration and integration.
In spite of successful integration, why do conflicts increasingly arise?
The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
At one table is German society, at the cat table the first generation of migrants.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to join the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to participate.
This is leading to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not decisive whether to classify oneself politically right or left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?" he emphasizes.
At first rather behave, then the discussion round starts ever more lively.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands before, not on stage, a symbol of discussion: she is at eye level.
The Sociology Professor does not force his opinion, emphasizes that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject, because "only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions," says El Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing session he also had an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties, intensively discussed.

Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is obviously huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the land in Landsham South.
The municipality of Pliening sold the first plots of land in the new Landsham-Süd area on the free market.
That's what Mayor Roland Frick says.

Schalkes Naldo succeeds "big sport" on the bench
For the third time in a row not in the startel: Nevertheless Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had sat for the third time in a row not in the Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange bench, the understanding would have been great for many people if the almost two-meter-large Brazilian had spoken the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle after the 1:0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 as usual and the head coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his pros, the 36-year-old, whom everyone simply calls Naldo, joined in and said: "Thank you, coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sports," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice captain, who did not have any resentment despite his re-serving existence.
Presumably Naldo knows, who was celebrated last season as the best Schalker, that he actually did not get on the parking track with his coach - but for good reasons gets a break.
A reason called load control.
It was not easy to tell him that
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'll tell you the truth," Tedesco reported about the moment he told Naldo that he was not on the starting team.
He's an important player, an important person.
But it is always about the thing, it is about the club," Tedesco explained.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto for 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can take a breather right now.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation that finally caught Naldo.
And the Brazilians responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving himself an exemplary team player at the bank.
The mood in Austria's industry continued its descent faster in August compared to the eurozone.
The Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) was at 46.7 points at 37 months.
Nevertheless, Austria has the third best mood across Europe behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute reported on Monday on its survey among 3,000 companies.
Unlike Austria, the PMI of the euro zone increased by 1.1 to 45.1 points, which indicates growth for the 13th month in a row.
Only Ireland's industry cracked this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The final light was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer decreased but slower than in previous months.
In Spain, with 44.
"The slightly weakened descent might mean that the worst has survived," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But in the third quarter, industry remains the number one growth brake.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone fell as much as since November 2011.
The companies therefore lost jobs for the seventh month in a row.
In China, industrial production also declined more in August than initially assumed.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.
Experts initially expected 47.8 points.
The purchasing manager index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial enterprises.
Developments in turnover, employment, stocks and prices will be raised.
Tuchel's PSG team wins eighth in the eighth league game
29 September 2018 at 19:45
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel rushes with Paris Saint-Germain in France's Football Championship from victory to victory.
At the OGC Nice, the defending champion won 3:0 (1:0) thanks to two Superstar Neymar hits and was thus also successful in the eighth season.
Most recently, Olympique Lyon had such a good start to the season in France 82 years ago, and it was the first time in the history of the league.
The Brazilian Neymar led PSG after 22 minutes and made the finals in the replay time.
Christopher Nkunku (46th) provided for the interim 2:0.
As a result, Paris also won the rehearsal for the groundbreaking second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the league, Tuchel's team had to accept the only mandatory game defeat in Liverpool this season.

DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil to return to the national team.
"This is a question that, of course, depends on the fact that you get into the conversation, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one or the other as stated in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasic mower" of the "Image newspaper.
Despite the month-long debate over Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of 92-time national player Ozil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued playing for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would happen," said Grindel.
De 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also explained that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready to talk to coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to put up any pressure, but he knows it from football so that when "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a pity that this conversation has not come about."
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burnt
At 2.13 p.
Because a power line leads directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, danger was delayed.
The fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire on arrival.
The roof had to be practically completely removed and fire debris removed to the necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery to charge for lunch.
It could be the cause of fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the range of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still has to be determined - just like the fire cause.
It may be considerable, however, because the owner had many collectors' items in his garden hut.
Angry mother defends herself: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open street
What drove Lindsay Lohan to this strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (b.
This is reported by the U.
Here you see "Luckily kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows how Lohan gets out of a car and goes to a possibly homeless family she wants as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees the actress, Lohan follows her parents and children.
She accuses adults of child trafficking.
To all of this, she's not providing any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world sees it right now," Lohan says in the video, following the family along the street.
Apparently, she tries to separate the children from her parents.
Eventually, however, the obviously angry mother seems enough.
Looks like she's turning around and slapping Lohan.
In tears, the actress asserts how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What prompted Lohan to do so is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is said to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander Mascot will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: Number of deaths on Sulawesi increases to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 people died.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams have not yet entered the devastated areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Supervisor
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused unrest in the stock markets at the beginning of August when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car manufacturer.

Party Congress of British Conservatives
Sharply guarded - the Tories Congress
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party congress is about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson at the front.
referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a country in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing over the double names for years already.
Now they've agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and the population will vote on this Sunday - whether it is going well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") is Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in Brazil is divided.
Thousands of people went to the streets in several cities to protest the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump Brazil" acts as an anti-system candidate, leading the polls.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned
"The Diesel task force still exists," said Peter Mertens, Chief Development Officer, to the industry journal "Automobile Week".
In December 2017, Audi CEO Rupert Stadler, who was imprisoned and on leave, announced that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"All engine/gear combinations are expected to be tested in the first quarter of 2018, he said.
Mertens said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in addressing the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The taskforce was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi's parent Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car maker had made "serious organizational changes" so that such a scandal never occurred again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and will continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi chief of having authorised the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust gas values after they become aware of the fraud.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Bram Schot currently heads the company as acting CEO.
Due to the switch to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP there were production failures at Audi, said Schot the "Heilbronner Voice".
In principle, he sees a declining demand for saloons such as Audi models A6, A7 and A8, produced in Neckarsulm.
"This segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot puts his trust in electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, 15,000 reservations are already available.
Grindel strives for re-election - Lahm to join the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run for office as DFB President again next year, despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup event and the Özil affair.
"I do my job.
You have to try again and again to re-election, I will.
And then you have to look if the support is there.
The head of the association would find it "notable" in his own words if he did not "want to work on the future project" after the match for the 2024 European Championship.
Grindel has been the head of the association since April 2016 as the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, who fell over the summer tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected to a full term of three years.
The next vote will take place at the German Federal Day on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM leader Philipp Lahm will work in the DFB Bureau.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would continue to advise the Bureau in this role and then, of course, be warmly invited to provide his experience on sporting issues," said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB boss.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a national player without a migrant background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, this office is held by the Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic who have family roots in Cameroon.
"If one without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says that "the issue is important, we have to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local associations where integration must work," said Grindel.

New addition Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer in Berlin with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counter) from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators at his official debut.
Ex-master Brose Bamberg won with 84:80 (39:37) at S.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni came to 14 meters.

Erdoğan inaugurates mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Critics of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite German supporters of the Gülen movement and take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens wherever they live.
We will not allow Sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, Cologne city centre was partially closed.
Several thousand policemen were in action - including snipers.
The Islamic Association Ditib is in criticism because it is regarded as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music vs.
Musicians like Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have promoted more commitment to fighting poverty and disease at a joint concert at Central Park in New York City.
"Commit wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night in front of around 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B performed in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I sweat, but it's okay, 'cause I am here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and relief organizations also appeared on stage during the multi-hour spectacle.
In between, however, there was a scare second, when many spectators thought that the sound of a falling metal barrier was gunshot, scared and tried to escape.
Panic came short, people ran into confusion.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed people down from the stage.
"No one tries to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Those who wanted to get one had to read and spread texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and diseases on the internet.
For the numerous musicians and actors there was cheer and applause from the audience - shouts for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
Although he spoke together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake in the U.
At least three women have filed abuse charges up to the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he rejects.

"You can also meet me in an elevator at any time," Flake said to the crowd at the New York concert.
Freedom of the press: German government defends the dismissal of the journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the dismissal of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
In the chancellor's office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had overlaid a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists".
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was about interrupting the press conference.
The journalist's action had caused a serious disturbance, which was unacceptable.
He had arranged for personal protectors to take the man out.
Seibert said that it is not allowed to demonstrate political concerns during press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This is completely independent of whether or not it is a legitimate concern.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah Gulf Movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt of 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are threatened with imprisonment for several decades.
Foreign journalists are also not certain of the Turkish authorities: the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested in early September.
Most recently, the cases of the detained journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a sensation.
Although they came free and could return to Germany, there are still trials in Turkey against them.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him as fresh and handsome: Florian David Fitz.
One has to look twice: Yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for happy conversations at the counter of the Hamburg harbour bar "Schellfishposten".
Moderator Ina Müller meets with her guests some beer, some wine or even higher-percent drinks to loosen the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also take courage for the obligatory singing.
On Friday another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time the actor Florian David Fitz is known from movies like "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Hottest Day".
The Municher got the trip to the far north but not well.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely crushed on it, his eyes only two small slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he isn't ill, he only has a powerful hangover.
Addressing his fans, he posted some - probably not very serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER goes to Inas Night.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And spray.
And the round of egg liqueurs that Ina throws at 6:30, let go of it, too.
The 43-year-old truly faces alcohol consumption.
His fans posted a few tips to fight afterlife.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - probably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
It is not known how Ina Müller survived the nightly drinking.
Since she moderates the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more proven...
To a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and treason
The entry into the 36-kilometre long railway cycle path in Red Riding Hoodland in Treysa is difficult to find and waste.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are sought, but solutions hardly emerge.
Shards, cigarette dumps, garbage and debris, demolished trash cans and now dismantled signposts - this is how the entrance with seating group to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has long been presented.
For the flagship railway bike trail in Red Riding Hoodland a more than infamous sight.
The topic has been occupied by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, according to Ulrich Wüstenhagen's bicycle traffic officer.
The problem had already been raised in the Cycling Advisory Council.
There is no solution yet.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to regular emptying of waste containers and cleaning of surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the imperative of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reported that the topic was also included in the local council.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place to celebrate on weekends.
Not only is it often loud, the situation is also destroyed: posts torn from the ground, trash cans demolished, signs bent around, seat furniture smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are angry that the resting place on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for drinking.
"The focus here is clearly on the Haaße hill along the entire cycle path," confirms the bicycle traffic officer, who is now also worried about the new cycle centre in Ziegenhain, which is opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "Perhaps this sets the threshold significantly higher to attack common property.
This would assume, however, that a police patrol will pass in a timely manner.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaße hill.
He needed to be made more attractive.
One could be very satisfied with the frequenting of the cycle path so far.
Tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high compared to others in Germany," says ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger, ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in Asheroder Straße in Treysa.
There's no turning trail on the hill.
In case of heavy traffic it can happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between the traffic flow on both sides", she explains.
This is no problem for sporty drivers, but it is for older people and especially children.
Music Contest in the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call for a music contest was a success, creative and together.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hilstrup, in the "Music contest for big and small young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family affair with coffee and cakes from the volunteers of the cultural station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long Albanian living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and Zwarties.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We haven't seen this in other districts.
To what did the copywriters look connected?
Lake Hiltruper and the market avenue were particularly frequently mentioned in the villages.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his hit song.
The Kulturbahnhof was also honored.
Again and again it was about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short breaks with short interviews with the interpreters or hints about her work.
Humberg learned that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also taught guitar.
Franke knew from the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a large event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has meanwhile placed everything on YouTube.
"This is not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
For the favourites of the jury there was nevertheless something special - so that others can listen to their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record a complete CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Hemig with his Hiltrup hit, which particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tolle.
Like all of them, the children performed again for the finale - and even sounded "properly good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, relation to Hiltrup, catchiness of melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund and Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive launched the event on the occasion of its tenth anniversary.
She considered the event a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The Word Game: "Decrypto" in Game Test
The players form two teams facing each other.
For each page there is a visual screen, in which four maps with keywords, which you can decipher - the old trick with the red slide - only after you put them into it.
This ensures that the opposite side cannot read anything by mistake.
For example, the maps read from left to right: "1.
2nd window.
3rd cube.
4th Festival.
These are the concepts that need to be encrypted from the beginning.
Because here we should not guess the terms, but codes.
One player per team alternates is the encryptor.
He gets a code card that might say 3.4.2.
In "Decrypto" they should not guess the terms behind the cover, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "cure", "fix" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not as much as possible; because the game wins if he manages to crack the code twice.
So the encryptor notes and reads aloud: "Throw" for the cubes, "Lose" as a contrast to Fest; here, of course, something like "party" would be possible and "Prague" because he paid attention at school and knows the window crash there.
So it goes round by round, team by team.
One does not know the concepts of the opposite side - but this can be better combined with any hint the encryptor gives there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too crazy, the descriptions should be, or you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic to "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players probably have to study it for quite a long time until they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.
But once you get started, you'll be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
But overall "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as predecessors and genre primus "Codenames", which is also an agent theme for a game of less words, but much better to play in small groups.
To whom it is only about guessing and not about victory points, can also easily invent a version for two to do so.
Kulmbach: Man shows Hitler salute and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach twice on Saturday night to Sunday.
He first showed Hitler's greetings in the Upper Town of a passing police patrol, later he also appeared in a bar in the upper town when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholized by the police, he had to spend the night in the detention cell at the Kulmbach police inspection.
He has to be responsible for the use of signs of unconstitutional organisations in a sober state.
Pressig factory was home to the Schubloks
The railway depot in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
A piece of railway history ended in 1991.
"When buffers popped on buffers, you heard it all over Pressig", remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That wasn't bothering anyone.
The brakes squealed and gnawed the wagons.
That was a train.
Statements that symbolize Dinkel's homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen mountain route to the north, which after an ascent of about 220 meters has its peak in Steinbach am Wald.
To cope with this, train and thrust locomotives used to be needed in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprentice workshops, cabling and railway workshops.
"The heartpiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years professional railway operator.
The Pressig railway depot, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - northern half.
On 15.
The electrification of the 1939 line already minimized the need for train and thrust locomotives.
From 1977, they were only used on freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10 000 weights were still placed each month.
In 1982, parts of the factory were demolished, and in 1991 the rest were demolished.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that we have not considered a better use of the site, also in terms of freight transport".
On Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig for the anniversary "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later the end.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressig marshalling station was history.
"The shunters and inhibitors did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen led for the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures are here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with opening success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have finished second in the tennis tournament in Beijing as before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French Kristina Mladenovic.
Next opponent of the world ranking third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kasachsten or Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina when the Russian at number 13 abandoned.
The swäbin now gets to do it with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition in Mittelehrenbach was opened on the weekend as part of the series "Art and pleasure".
With great ease registered organizers and visitors looked the ideal weather when the special vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open area of the estate Dahlmann Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourist association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Art and pleasure".

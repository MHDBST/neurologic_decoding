DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil to return to the national team.
"This is a question that, of course, depends on the fact that you get into the conversation, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one or the other as stated in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasic mower" of the "Image-Newspaper".
Despite the month-long debate over Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of 92-time national player ÖzIL.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued playing for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would happen," said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to put up any pressure, but he knows it from football so that when "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a pity that this conversation has not yet come about".
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burnt
At 2.13 p.
Because a power line leads directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, danger was delayed.
The fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire on arrival.
The roof had to be removed practically in its entirety and fire debris removed to the absolutely necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery to charge for lunch.
That might be the cause of fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the range of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still has to be determined - just as the cause of the fire.
He may be considerable, though.
